         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="intro"><pb xml:id="v.6.p.395"/> 
          <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent"> This charming essay, by far the best in the volume, suffers from only one defect, its length. Though Plutarch again and again, by his narrative skill and naïve or unconscious humour, will delight even those who have hardened their hearts against him (I mean his editors), he cannot at last resist the temptation to indulge in what he considered scientific analysis and enlightened exhortation. He is then merely dull. But, taken as a whole, the essay is surely a success, and as organic and skilful a performance as any in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>.</p>

<p rend="indent">The work was written after <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Curiositate</title> and before <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Tranquillitate</title>, <title rend="italic">De Capienda ex Inimicis Utilitate</title>, and <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Laude Ipsius</title>.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">I have thus combined the conclusions of Pohlenz, Brokate, and Hein.</note> It stands in the Lamprias catalogue as No. 92.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Mr C. B. Robinson’s translation, or paraphrase, of this and several other essays in this volume, arrived too late to be of service (see <title rend="italic">Plutarch, Selected Essays</title>, Putnam, New York, 1937).</note></p></div><pb xml:id="v.6.p.397"/>

<div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="1"><p rend="indent">It is a troublesome and difficult task that philosophy has in hand when it undertakes to cure garrulousness. For the remedy, words of reason, requires listeners; but the garrulous listen to nobody, for they are always talking. And this is the first symptom of their ailment: looseness of the tongue becomes impotence of the ears.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">It suits Plutarch’s humour in this passage, in which he speaks of garrulity as a disease, to invent one, and possibly two, pseudo-medical terms, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσιγησία</foreign>, <q>inability to keep silent,</q> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνηκοΐα</foreign>, <q>inability to listen.</q> The figure is maintained in <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαρρέουσι</foreign> at the end of section d. Rouse suggests: <q>And here is the first bad symptom in diarrhoea of the tongue - constipation of the ears.</q></note> For it is a deliberate deafness, that of men who, I take it, blame Nature because they have only one tongue, but two ears.b If, then, Euripides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 39 b; von Arnim, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Stoic. Vet. Frag.</title>, i. p. 68, Zeno, Frag. 310.</note> was right when he said with reference to the unintelligent hearer, <quote rend="blockquote"><l>I could not fill a man who will not hold </l> <l>My wise words flooding into unwise ears,</l></quote> it would be more just to say to the garrulous man, or rather about the garrulous man, <quote rend="blockquote"><l>I could not fill a man who will not take </l> <l>My wise words flooding into unwise ears,</l></quote> or rather submerging, a man who talks to those <pb xml:id="v.6.p.399"/> who will not listen, and will not listen when others talk. For even if he does listen for a moment, when his loquacity is, as it were, at ebb, the rising tide immediately makes up for it many times over.</p>

<p rend="indent">They give the name of Seven-voiced<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A portico on the east side of the Altis; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Pausanias, v. 21. 17, Pliny, <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>, xxxvi. 15. 100.</note> to the portico at Olympia which reverberates many times from a single utterance; and if but the least word sets garrulousness in motion, straightway it echoes round about on all sides, <quote rend="blockquote">Touching the heart-strings never touched before.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 456 c, 501 a, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note></quote> Indeed one might think that babbler’s ears have no passage bored through<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aristophanes, <title rend="italic">Thesm.</title>, 18: <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκην δὲ χοάνης ὦτα διετετρήνατο</foreign>.</note> to the soul, but only to the tongue.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Philoxenus in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Gnomologium Vaticanum</title>, 547 (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Wiener Stud.</title>, xi. 234).</note> Consequently, while others retain what is said, in talkative persons it goes right through in a flux; then they go about like empty vessels,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the proverb: <q>Empty vessels make the loudest noise.</q></note> void of sense, but full of noise. </p></div>
         
<div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="2"><p rend="indent">But if, however, we are resolved to leave no means untried, let us say to the babbler, <quote rend="blockquote">Hush, child: in silence many virtues lie,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 147, Sophocles, Frag. 78 (Frag. 81 ed. Pearson, vol. i. p. 50), from the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Aleadae</title>.</note></quote> and among them the two first and greatest, the merits of hearing and being heard; neither of these can happen to talkative persons, but even in that which they desire especially they fail miserably. For in other diseases of the soul,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 519 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> such as love of money, love of glory, love of pleasure, there is at least the possibility of attaining their desires, but for babblers this is very difficult: they desire listeners and cannot <pb xml:id="v.6.p.401"/> get them, since every one runs away headlong. If men are sitting in a public lounge or strolling about in a portico, and see a talker coming up, they quickly give each other the counter-sign to break camp. And just as when silence occurs in an assemblage they say that Hermes has joined the company, so when a chatterbox comes into a dinner-party or social gathering, every one grows silent, not wishing to furnish him a hold; and if he begins of his own accord to open his mouth, <quote rend="blockquote">As when the North-wind blows along A sea-beaten headland before the storm,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 455 a, <hi rend="superscript">supra</hi>.</note></quote> suspecting that they will be tossed about and sea-sick, they rise up and go out. And so it is a talker’s lot when travelling by land or sea, to find volunteer listeners neither as table-companions nor as tentmates, but only conscripts; for the talker is at you everywhere, catching your cloak, plucking your beard, digging you in the ribs. <quote rend="blockquote">Then are your feet of the greatest value,</quote> as Archilochus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Edmonds, <title rend="italic">Elegy and Iambus</title>, ii. p. 182, Frag. 132.</note> says, and on my word the wise Aristotle will agree. For when Aristotle himself was annoyed by a chatterer and bored with some silly stories, and the fellow kept repeating, <q>Isn’t it wonderful, Aristotle?</q> <q>There’s nothing wonderful about that,</q> said Aristotle, <q>but that anyone with feet endures you.</q> To another man of the same sort, who said after a long rigmarole, <q>Poor philosopher, I’ve wearied you with my talk,</q> <q>Heavens, no!</q> said Aristotle, <q>I wasn’t listening.</q> In fact, <pb xml:id="v.6.p.403"/> if chatterers force their talk upon us, the soul surrenders to them the ears to be flooded from outside, but herself within unrolls thoughts of another sort and follows them out by herself. Therefore talkers do not find it easy to secure listeners who either pay attention or believe what they say; for just as they affirm that the seed of persons too prone to lusts of the flesh is barren, so is the speech of babblers ineffectual and fruitless.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Lycurgus</title>, xix. (51 e-f).</note></p></div>
         
<div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="3"><p rend="indent">And yet Nature has built about none of our parts so stout a stockade as about the tongue,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Commentarii in Hesiodum</title>, 71 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. pp. 87-88).</note> having placed before it as an outpost the teeth, so that when reason within tightens <q>the reins of silence,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, v. 226; <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιγαλόεντα</foreign>, of course, means <q>glossy</q> or <q>shining,</q> but here it is probably used as a playful pun on <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιγή</foreign>.</note> if the tongue does not obey or restrain itself, we may check its incontinence by biting it till it bleeds. For Euripides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Adapted from <title rend="italic">Bacchae</title>, 386, 388.</note> says that <q>disaster is the end,</q> not of unbolted treasuries or storerooms, but of <q>unbridled tongues.</q> And those who believe that storerooms without doors and purses without fastenings are of no use to their owners, yet keep their mouths without lock or door, maintaining as perpetual an outflow as the mouth of the Black Sea, appear to regard speech as the least valuable of all things. They do not, therefore, meet with belief,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 519 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> which is the object of all speech. For this is the proper end and aim of speech, to engender belief in the hearer; but chatterers are disbelieved even if they are telling the truth. For as wheat shut up in a jar<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Or a <q>pit,</q> perhaps; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 697 d.</note> is found to have increased in quantity, but to have deteriorated <pb xml:id="v.6.p.405"/> in quality, so when a story finds its way to a chatterer, it generates a large addition of falsehood and thereby destroys its credit. </p></div>

While it is true that the drunken man talks foolishness in his cups, the chatterer talks foolishness on all occasions, in the market-place, in the theatre, out walking, drunk or sober, by day, by night. As your physician, he is worse than the disease; as your ship-mate, more unpleasant than sea-sickness; his praises are more annoying than another’s blame: we certainly have greater pleasure in company with clever rascals than with honest chatterboxes.

But babblers actually wear out our ears by their repetitions, just as though they were smudging palimpsests.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch probably means that talkers wear out our ears by the repetitions of stale news, just as palimpsests are worn out by constant erasure. But not all points of the comparison are clear; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 779 c; Cicero, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">ad Fam.</title>, vii. 18. 2.</note> </p> </div>
         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="6"><p rend="indent">Let this, then, be the first thing of which we remind them - that just as wine, discovered for the promotion of pleasure and good fellowship, is sometimes misused to produce discomfort and intoxication by those<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Probably referring to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμποσίαρχος</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign>, for example, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 620 a ff.), or <foreign xml:lang="lat">magister bibendi</foreign>.</note> who compel others to drink it undiluted in large quantities, so speech, which is the most pleasant and human of social ties, is made inhuman and unsocial by those who use it badly and wantonly, because they offend those whom they think they please, are ridiculed for their attempts at gaining admiration, and are disliked because of the very means they employ to gain affection. As, then, he can have no share in Aphrodite who uses her girdle to drive away and alienate those who seek his company, so he who arouses annoyance and hostility with his speech is no friend of the Muses and a stranger to art. </p> </div>
         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="7"><p rend="indent">Now of the other affections and maladies some are dangerous, some detestable, some ridiculous; but garrulousness has all these qualities at once; for babblers are derided for telling what everyone knows, they are hated for bearing bad news, they run into danger since they cannot refrain from revealing secrets. So it is that Anacharsis,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A Scythian of high rank, who travelled widely in the pursuit of knowledge, and visited Athens in the time of Solon, <foreign xml:lang="lat">circa</foreign> 597 b.c.</note> when he had been entertained and feasted at Solons house and lay down to sleep, was seen to have his left hand placed <pb xml:id="v.6.p.413"/> upon his private parts, but his right hand upon his mouth; for he believed, quite rightly, that the tongue needs the stronger restraint. It would not be easy, for example, to enumerate as many men who have been ruined by incontinent lust as is the number of cities and empires which a secret revealed has brought to destruction.

Pupius Piso, the orator, not wishing to be troubled, ordered his slaves to speak only in answer to questions and not a word more. Subsequently, wishing to pay honour to Clodius when he was a magistrate, Piso gave orders that he be invited to dinner and prepared what was, we may suppose, a sumptuous banquet.

And of this let us now speak. </p> </div>
         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="19"><p rend="indent">For it is impossible to check the babbler by gripping the reins, as it were; his disease must be mastered by habituation. In the first place, then, when questions are asked of neighbours, let him accustom himself to remaining silent until all have refused a response: <quote rend="blockquote">For counsel’s aim is not that of a race,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">To see who can get to the goal first.</note> </quote> as Sophocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 312, Frag. 772 (Frag. 856 ed. Pearson, vol. iii. p. 63).</note> says, nor, indeed, is this the aim of <pb xml:id="v.6.p.451"/> speaking and answering. For in a race the victory is his who comes in first; but here, if another makes a sufficient answer, it is proper to join in the approval and assent and so acquire the reputation of being a friendly fellow. But if such an answer is not made, then it is not invidious or inopportune both to point out the answer others have not known and thus to fili in the gap. And, in particular, let us be on our guard, when someone else has been asked a question, that we do not forestall him by taking the answer out of his mouth. For perhaps there are other times also when it is not seemly, another having been asked, to shoulder him aside and volunteer ourselves, since we shall seem to be casting a slur both on the man asked, as being unable to furnish what is demanded of him, and on the asker, as being ignorant of the source from which he can get help; and, in particular, such precipitancy and boldness in answering questions smacks of insolence. For one who tries to get in the answTer ahead of the man who is questioned suggests, <q>What do you need <emph>him</emph> for?</q> or <q>What does <emph>he</emph> know?</q> or <q>When I am present, no one else should be asked about these matters.</q> And yet we often ask people questions, not because we need an answer, but to elicit some friendly word from them, and because we wish to draw them on to friendly converse, as Socrates did with Theaetetus and Charmides.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Theaetetus</title>, 143 d, <title rend="italic">Charmides</title>, 154 e ff.</note> So to take the answer out of another’s mouth, to divert another’s hearing and attract his attention and wrest it from some other, is as bad as to run up and kiss someone who wished to be kissed by somebody else, or to turn toward yourself someone who was looking at another; since, even if he who has been asked cannot give the <pb xml:id="v.6.p.453"/> information, it is proper to practise restraint and conform oneself to the wish of the asker and thus to encounter with modesty and decorum the situation, an invitation, as it were, given to another. And it is also true that if persons who are asked questions make mistakes in their answers, they meet with just indulgence; but he who voluntarily undertakes an answer and anticipates another is unpleasant even if he corrects a mistake, and if he makes a mistake himself, he affords a malicious joy to one and all, and becomes an object of ridicule. </p> </div>
         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="20"><p rend="indent">Then the second matter for diligent practice concerns our own answers; to these the chatterer must pay very close attention: in the first place, that he may not inadvertently give a serious answer to those who provoke him to talk merely that they may insolently ridicule him.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 547 c.</note> For some persons who require no information, but merely to divert and amuse themselves, devise questions and put them to men of this sort to set going their foolish twaddle. Against this talkers should be on their guard and not leap upon a subject quickly, or as though grateful that it is offered to them, but should first consider both the character of the questioner and the necessity for the question. And when it appears that the questioner is really anxious to learn, the babbler must accustom himself to stop and leave between the question and the answer an interval, in which the asker may add anything he wishes and he himself may reflect upon his reply instead of overrunning and obscuring the question by giving a long string of answers in a hurry while the question is still being asked. For although the Pythian priestess is accustomed to <pb xml:id="v.6.p.455"/> deliver some oracles on the instant, even before the question is put-for the god whom she serves <quote rend="blockquote">Understands the dumb and hears when no man speaks<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, i. 47.</note>-</quote> yet the man who wishes to make a careful answer must wait to apprehend exactly the sense and the intent of him who asks the question, lest it befall, as the proverb<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Paroemiographi Graeci</title>, i. p. 28; Kock, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Com.

Socrates, in fact, used to control his thirst in this manner-he would not allow himself to drink after exercise until he had drawn up and poured out the first bucketful, so that his irrational part might be trained to await the time dictated by reason. </p> </div>
         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="21"><p rend="indent">Furthermore, there are three kinds of answers to questions: the barely necessary, the polite, and the superfluous. For example, if someone asks, <q>Is Socrates at home?</q> one person may reply, as it were unwillingly and grudgingly, <q>Not at home.</q> And if he wishes to adopt the Laconic style, he may omit the <q>At home</q> and only utter the bare negative. So the Spartans, when Philip wrote to ask if they would receive him into their city, wrote a large <q>No</q> on the paper and sent it back. Another will answer more politely, <q>He is not at home, but at the bank,</q> and if he wants to give fuller measure may <pb xml:id="v.6.p.457"/> add, <q>waiting there for some guests.</q> But your over-officious and garrulous man, particularly if he happens to have read Antimachus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The epic poet, a by-word for longwindedness: thus Catullus (95. 10) calls him <q> <foreign xml:lang="lat">tumidus</foreign>.</q></note> of Colophon, will say, <q>He is not at home, but at the bank, waiting for some Ionian guests on whose behalf he has had a letter from Alcibiades who is near Miletus staying with Tissaphernes,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Alcibiades</title>, xxiv.

<p rend="indent">Regarding this tendency especially, one must keep talkativeness within bounds by following the question step by step and circumscribing the answer within a circle to which the questioner’s need gives the centre and the radius.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 524 e, 603 e, 776 f, 822 d, 1098 d.</note> So when Carneades,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Diogenes Laertius, iv. 63; for Carneades’ noisiness <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 791 a-b.</note> who had not yet acquired a great reputation, was disputing in a gymnasium, the director sent and bade him lower his voice, which was a very loud one. And when Carneades said, <q>Give me something to regulate my voice,</q> the director aptly rejoined, <q>I am giving you the person conversing with you.</q> So, in making an answer, let the wishes of the questioner provide the regulation. <pb xml:id="v.6.p.459"/></p></div>
         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="22"><p rend="indent">Moreover, just as Socrates<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Memorabilia</title>, i. 3. 6; <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 124 d, 521 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, 661 f.</note> used to urge men to be on their guard against those foods which induce us to eat when we are not hungry, and against those liquids which induce us to drink when we are not thirsty, so it is with the babbler as regards subjects for talk: those in which he takes most delight and employs <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad nauseam</foreign> he should fear stoutly resist when they stream in upon him. For example, military men<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 546 d, 630 f ff.</note> are great tellers of war-stories, and the Poet introduces Nestor<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For example, Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, i. 269 ff.</note> in that character, often narrating his own deeds of prowess. Again, as one might expect, those who have scored a victory in the law-courts or have had some unexpected success at the courts of governors or kings are attacked, as it were, by a malady which never leaves them, by the desire to call to mind and tell over and over again how they made their entrance, how they were presented, how they argued, how they held forth, how they confuted some opponents or accusers, how they were applauded.

And Cyrus’s<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Cyropaedia</title>, i.4. 4; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 632 c.</note> conduct was admirable, because he challenged his mates to match themselves with him, not in those contests in which he was superior, but in those in which he was less skilled than they, so that he might cause no pain by surpassing them and might also have the advantage of learning something. But the chatterer, on the contrary, if some topic comes up from which he can learn and find out something he does not know, thrusts it aside and diverts it, being unable to give even so small a fee as silence, but he works steadily around until he drives the conversation into the stale and well-worn paths of twaddle. Just so, in my native town, there was a man who chanced to have read two or three books of Ephorus, and would always bore everybody to death and put every dinner-party to rout by invariably narrating the battle of Leuctra and its sequel; so he got the nickname of <q>Epameinondas.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">With this chapter <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> chapters 18 and 19 of <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Laude Ipsius</title> (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 546 b-e) and the first part of <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaestiones Conviv.</title>, ii. 1 (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 629 e - 632 c).</note></p></div>
         <div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="23"><p rend="indent">Nevertheless, this is the least of the evils, and we should turn garrulity into these channels; for talkativeness will be less unpleasant when its excesses are in some learned subject. Yet such persons must accustom themselves to do some writing and so argue all by themselves.

And it will also be very advantageous for chatterers to frequent invariably the company of their superiors and elders, out of respect for whose opinion they will become accustomed to silence.</p>

<p rend="indent">And with these exercises in habituation it is proper to intermix and entwine that well-known vigilance and habit of reflection, at the very moment when we are about to speak and the words are hurrying to our lips, <q>What is this remark that is so pressing and importunate? What object is my tongue panting for? What good will come of its being said or what ill of its being suppressed?</q> For it is not as though the remark were some oppressive weight which one ought to get rid of, since it stays by you all the same even if it is spoken; when men talk, it is either for their own sake, because they need something, or to benefit their hearers, or they seek to ingratiate themselves with each other by seasoning with the salt of conversation the pastime or business in which they happen to be engaged. But if a remark is neither useful to the speaker nor of serious importance to the hearers, and if pleasure or charm is not in it, why is it made? For the futile and purposeless can exist in speech as well as in deeds.</p>

<p rend="indent">And over and above all else we must keep at hand and in our minds the saying of Simonides,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 10 f, 125 d; 505 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> that he had often repented of speaking, but never of holding <pb xml:id="v.6.p.467"/> his tongue. We must remember also that practice is master of all things and stronger than anything else; since people can even get rid of hiccoughs and coughs by resisting them resolutely and with much pain and trouble. But silence, as Hippocrates<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 90 c-d.</note> says, not only prevents thirst, but also never causes sorrow and suffering. </p></div>
