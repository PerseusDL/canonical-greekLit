<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2" n="1"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="1"><p>Aristides, the son of Lysimachus, belonged to the tribe Antiochis, and to the deme Alopece. As regards his substance, stories differ, some having it that he passed all the days of his life in severe poverty, and that at his death he left behind him two daughters who for a long time were not sought in marriage because of their indigence. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="2"><p> But in contradiction of this story which so many writers give, Demetrius of Phalerum, in his <q type="title">Socrates,</q> says he knows of an estate in Phalerum which belonged to Aristides—the one in which he lies buried, and regards as proofs of his opulent circumstances, first, his office of Archon Eponymous, which only he could hold who obtained it by lot from among the families carrying the highest property assessments (these were called Pentacosiomedimni, or Five-hundred-bushellers); </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="3"><p> second, his banishment in ostracism, for no poor men, but only men from great houses which incurred envy because of their family prestige, were liable to ostracism; third, and last, the fact that he left in the precinct of Dionysus as offerings for victory some choregic tripods, which, even in our day, were pointed out as still bearing the inscription: <q type="written">The tribe Antiochis was victorious; Aristides was Choregus; Archestratus was Poet.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="4"><p>  Now this last argument, though it seems very strong, is really very weak. For both Epaminondas, who, as all men know, was reared and always lived in great poverty, and Plato the philosopher, took it upon themselves to furnish munificent public performances, the first, of men trained to play the flute, the second, of boys trained to sing and dance; but Plato received the money that he spent thereon from Dion of Syracuse, and Epaminonmas from Pelopidas. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="5"><p> Good men wage no savage and relentless war against the gifts of friends, but while they look upon gifts taken to be stored away and increase the receiver’s wealth as ignoble and mean, they refuse none which promote an unselfish and splendid munificence.  However, as regards the tripods, Panaetius tries to show that Demetrius was deceived by identity of name. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="6"><p> From the Persian wars, he says, down to the end of the Peloponnesian war, only two Aristides are recorded as victorious choregi, and neither of them is identical with the son of Lysimachus. One was the son of Xenophilus, and the other lived long afterwards, as is proved by the inscription itself, which is written in the character used after Eucleides,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> In 403-402 B.C., when Eucleides was Archon Eponymous, the Ionian alphabet was officially adopted at Athens.</note> as well as by the last name, Archestratus, of whom there is no record during the Persian wars, while during the time of the Peloponnesian war his name often appears as that of a choral poet. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="7"><p>  This argument of Panaetius should be more closely examined as to its validity; but to banishment in ostracism every one was liable who was superior to the common run of men in reputation, or lineage, or eloquence. And so it was that Damon, the teacher of Pericles, was ostracized because he was thought to be rather extraordinary in his wisdom.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Plut. Per. 4.2">Plut. Per. 4.2</bibl> </note> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="8"><p> Furthermore, Idomeneus says that Aristides obtained the office of archon, not by lot, but by the election of the Athenians.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> From 508 B.C. to 487 B.C. the archons were elected by the Assembly; after 487, they were once more chosen by lot.</note> And if he was made archon after the battle of Plataea, as Demetrius himself has written, it is certainly very credible that in view of such a reputation and such successes as he there won, he should be deemed worthy, for his valor, of an office which men who drew lots for it obtained for their wealth. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:1" n="9"><p> In fact, Demetrius is clearly ambitious to rescue not only Aristides, but also Socrates from what he deems the great evil of poverty, for he says that Socrates owned not only his house, but also seventy minas out at interest with Crito.  </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2" n="2"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:2" n="1"><p>  Aristides was an intimate friend of that Cleisthenes who set the state in order after the expulsion of the tyrants. He also admired and emulated, above all other statesmen, Lycurgus the Lacedaemonian. He therefore favoured an aristocratic form of government, and ever had opposed to him, as champion of the people, Themistocles the son of Neocles. Some say that even as boys and fellow-pupils, from the outset, in every word and deed, whether serious or trivial, they were at variance with one another, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:2" n="2"><p> and that by this very rivalry their natures were straightway made manifest, the one as dexterous, reckless, and unscrupulous, easily carried with impetuosity into any and every undertaking; the other as established on a firm character, intent on justice, and admitting no falsity or vulgarity or deceit, not even in any sport whatsoever.  But Ariston of Ceos says that this enmity of theirs, which came to be so intense, had its origin in a love affair. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:2" n="3"><p> They were both enamored of Stesilaus, who was of Ceian birth, and in beauty of person the most brilliant of youths; and they cherished their passion so immoderately, that not even after the boy’s beauty had faded did they lay aside their rivalry, but, as though they had merely taken preliminary practice and exercise in that, they presently engaged in matters of state also with passionate heat and opposing desires. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:2" n="4"><p>  Themistocles joined a society of political friends, and so secured no inconsiderable support and power. Hence when some one told him that he would be a good ruler over the Athenians if he would only be fair and impartial to all, he replied: <q type="spoken">Never may I sit on a tribunal where my friends are to get no more advantage from me than strangers.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:2" n="5"><p> But Aristides walked the way of statesmanship by himself, on a private path of his own, as it were, because, in the first place, he was unwilling to join with any comrades in wrong-doing, or to vex them by withholding favours; and, in the second place, he saw that power derived from friends incited many to do wrong, and so was on his guard against it, deeming it right that the good citizen should base his confidence only on serviceable and just conduct.  </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2" n="3"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:3" n="1"><p>  However, since Themistocles was a reckless agitator, and opposed and thwarted him in every measure of state, Aristides himself also was almost compelled—partly in self-defence, and partly to curtail his adversary’s power, which was increasing through the favour of the many—to set himself in opposition to what Themistocles was trying to do, thinking it better that some advantages should escape the people than that his adversary, by prevailing everywhere, should become too strong. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:3" n="2"><p> Finally there came a time when he opposed and defeated Themistocles in an attempt to carry some really necessary measure. Then he could no longer hold his peace, but declared, as he left the Assembly, that there was no safety for the Athenian state unless they threw both Themistocles and himself into the death-pit. On another occasion he himself introduced a certain measure to the people, and was carrying it through successfully, in spite of the attacks of the opposition upon it, but just as the presiding officer was to put it to the final vote, perceiving, from the very speeches that had been made in opposition to it, the inexpediency of his measure, he withdrew it without a vote. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:3" n="3"><p> And oftentimes he would introduce his measures through other men, that Themistocles might not be driven by the spirit of rivalry with him to oppose what was expedient for the state.  Altogether admirable was his steadfast constancy amid the revulsions of political feeling. He was not unduly lifted up by his honors, and faced adversity with a calm gentleness, while in all cases alike he considered it his duty to give his services to his country freely and without any reward, either in money, or, what meant far more, in reputation. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:3" n="4"><p> And so it befell, as the story goes, that when the verses composed by Aeschylus upon Amphiaraus were recited in the theater:— <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>He wishes not to seem, but rather just to be,</l> <l>And reap a harvest from deep furrows in a mind</l> <l>From which there spring up honorable counselings,</l> </quote><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Aesch. Seven 592"> <title>Seven Against Thebes</title>, 592 ff.</bibl>(Dindorf).</note> all the spectators turned their eyes on Aristides, feeling that he, above all men, was possessed of such excellence.  </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2" n="4"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:4" n="1"><p>  It was not only against the inclinations of his good-will and personal favour that he was a most strenuous champion of justice, but also against those of his anger and hatred. At any rate a story is told, how he was once prosecuting an enemy in court, and after he had made his accusation the judges were loath to hear the defendant at all, and demanded that their vote be taken against him straightway; but Aristides sprang to his feet and seconded the culprit’s plea for a hearing and the usual legal procedure. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:4" n="2"><p> And again, when he was serving as private arbitrator between two men, on one of them saying that his opponent had done Aristides much injury, <q type="spoken">Tell me rather,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">whether he has done thee any wrong; it is for thee, not for myself, that I am seeking justice.</q> When he was elected overseer of the public revenues, he proved clearly that large sums had been embezzled, not only by his fellow-officials, but also by those of former years and particularly by Themistocles:— <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The man was clever, but of his hand had no control.</l> </quote> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:4" n="3"><p>  For this cause, Themistocles banded many together against Aristides, prosecuted him for theft at the auditing of his accounts, and actually got a verdict against him, according to Idomeneus. But the first and best men of the city were incensed at this, and he was not only exempted from his fine, but even appointed to administer the same charge again. Then he pretended to repent him of his former course, and made himself more pliable, thus giving pleasure to those who were stealing the common funds by not examining them or holding them to strict account, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:4" n="4"><p> so that they gorged themselves with the public moneys, and then lauded Aristides to the skies, and pleaded with the people in his behalf, eagerly desirous that he be once more elected to his office. But just as they were about to vote, Aristides rebuked the Athenians. <q type="spoken">Verily,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">when I served you in office with fidelity and honor, I was reviled and persecuted; but now that I am flinging away much of the common fund to thieves, I am thought to be an admirable citizen.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:4" n="5"><p><q rend="merge">For my part, I am more ashamed of my present honor than I was of my former condemnation, and I am sore distressed for you, because it is more honorable in your eyes to please base men than to guard the public moneys.</q> By these words, as well as by exposing their thefts, he did indeed stop the mouths of the men who were then testifying loudly in his favour, but he won genuine and just praise from the best citizens.  </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2" n="5"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:5" n="1"><p>  Now when Datis, on being sent by Darius ostensibly to punish the Athenians for burning Sardis, but really to subdue all the Hellenes, put in at Marathon with all his armament and went to ravaging the country, then, of the ten generals appointed by the Athenians for the conduct of the war, it was Miltiades who enjoyed the greatest consideration, but in reputation and influence Aristides was second. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:5" n="2"><p> By adopting at that time the opinion of Miltiades about the battle to be fought, he did much to turn the scale in its favour. And since each general held the chief authority for a single day in turn, when the command came round to him, he handed it over to Miltiades, thereby teaching his fellow-officers that to obey and follow men of wisdom is not disgraceful, but dignified and salutary. By thus appeasing the jealousy of his colleagues and inducing them to be cheerfully contented in the adoption of a single opinion (and that the best), he confirmed Miltiades in the strength which comes from an unrestricted power. For each of the other generals at once relinquished his own right to command for a day in turn, and put himself under the orders of Miltiades. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:5" n="3"><p> In the battle, the Athenian center was the hardest pressed, and it was there that the Barbarians held their ground the longest, over against the tribes Leontis and Antiochis. There, then, Themistocles and Aristides fought brilliantly, ranged side by side; for one was a Leontid, the other an Antiochid. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:5" n="4"><p> When the Athenians had routed the Barbarians and driven them aboard their ships, and saw that they were sailing away, not toward the islands, but into the gulf toward Attica under compulsion of wind and wave, then they were afraid lest the enemy find Athens empty of defenders, and so they hastened homeward with nine tribes, and reached the city that very day. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:5" n="5"><p> But Aristides was left behind at Marathon with his own tribe, to guard the captives and the booty. Nor did he belie his reputation, but though silver and gold lay about in heaps, and though there were all sorts of raiment and untold wealth besides in the tents and captured utensils, he neither desired to meddle with it himself, nor would he suffer any one else to do so, although certain ones helped themselves without his knowledge.

And besides, the people too must by this time have become greatly elated over their victory; they thought nothing too good for themselves, and were therefore vexed with those who towered above the multitude in name and reputation. </p></div>

The method of procedure—to give a general outline—was as follows.

But they much misjudged the man. Even before this decree of theirs, he was ever inciting and urging the Hellenes to win their freedom; and after it was passed, when Themistocles was general with sole powers, he assisted him in every undertaking and counsel, although he thereby, for the sake of the general safety, made his chiefest foe the most famous of men. </p></div>

He despatched all his cavalry against them as they lay encamped at the foot of Cithaeron, in positions that were rugged and rocky—all except the Megarians. These, to the number of three thousand, were encamped the rather in open plain. For this reason they suffered severely at the hands of the cavalry, which poured in tides against them, and found access to them on every side. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:14" n="2"><p> Accordingly, they sent a messenger in haste to Pausanias, bidding him come to their aid, since they were unable of themselves to withstand the host of the Barbarians. Pausanias, on hearing this, and seeing at once that the camp of the Megarians was as good as hidden from view by the multitude of the enemy’s javelins and arrows, and that its defenders were huddled together in narrow quarters, on his own part had no way of rendering them aid against horsemen, since his phalanx of Spartans was full-armored and slow of movement; </p></div>

The rest all hesitated, but Aristides, in behalf of the Athenians, undertook the task, and despatched his most zealous captain, Olympiodorus, with the three hundred picked men of his command, and archers mingled with them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:14" n="4"><p>  These quickly arrayed themselves and advanced to the attack on the run. Masistius, the commander of the Barbarian cavalry, a man of wonderful prowess and of surpassing stature and beauty of person, saw them coming, and at once wheeled his horse to face them and charged down upon them. Then there was a mighty struggle between those who withstood and those who made the charge, since both regarded this as a test of the whole issue between them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:14" n="5"><p> Presently the horse of Masistius was hit with an arrow, and threw his rider, who lay where he fell, unable to raise himself, so heavy was his armour; and yet he was no easy prey to the Athenians, though they pressed upon him and smote him. For not only his chest and head, but also his limbs were encased in gold and bronze and iron. But at last, with the spike of a javelin, through the eye-hole of his helmet, he was smitten to the death, and the rest of the Persians abandoned his body and fled. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:14" n="6"><p> The magnitude of their success was known to the Hellenes, not from the multitude of those they slew, for few had fallen, but from the grief of the Barbarians. For they shore their own hair in tribute to Masistius, and that of their horses and mules, and filled the plain with their wailing cries. They felt that they had lost a man who, after Mardonius himself, was by far the first in valor and authority.  </p></div></div>

At last Mardonius, since he had supplies remaining for only a few days, and since the Hellenes were ever increasing in number as fresh bodies joined them, impatiently determined to wait no longer, but to cross the Asopus at daybreak and attack the Athenians unexpectedly. During the evening he gave the watchword to his commanders. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:15" n="2"><p>  But about midnight a solitary horseman quietly approached the camp of the Hellenes, and falling in with the outposts, ordered that Aristides the Athenian come to him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:15" n="4"><p> When he had told him this, Alexander begged Aristides to keep the knowledge to himself and bear it well in mind, but to tell it to none other. Aristides replied that it was not honorable to conceal this knowledge from Pausanias, since it was on him that the supreme command devolved, but that it should not be told the other leaders before the battle; though in case Hellas were victorious, no man should remain ignorant of Alexander’s zeal and valor. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:16" n="2"><p>  The rest of the Athenian generals thought it inconsiderate and annoying in Pausanias to leave the rest of his line in the position assigned, while, he moved them, and them only, back and forth like Helots, and put them forward where the fighting was to be hottest. But Aristides declared that they were utterly wrong; they had contended emulously with the Tegeans, but a little while back, for the occupation of the left wing and plumed themselves on being preferred before those rivals; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:16" n="3"><p> but now, when the Lacedaemonians of their own accord vacated the right wing for them, and after a fashion proffered them the leadership among the Hellenes, they neither welcomed the reputation thus to be won, nor counted it gain that their contention would thus be, not with men of the same tribes and kindreds, but rather with Barbarians and natural enemies. Upon this the Athenians very willingly exchanged posts with the Spartans, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:16" n="4"><p> and the word passed from lip to lip far through their ranks that their enemies would attack them with no better arms and with no braver spirits than at Marathon, nay, with the same kind of archery as then, and with the same variegated vesture and gold adornments to cover soft bodies and unmanly spirits; <q type="spoken">while we have not only like arms and bodies with our brethren of that day, but that greater courage which is born of our victories; and our contest is not alone for land and city, as theirs was, but also for the trophies which they set up at Marathon and Salamis, in order that the world may think that not even those were due to Miltiades only, or to fortune, but to the Athenians.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:16" n="5"><p>  The Spartans and Athenians, then, were busily engaged in exchanging posts; but the Thebans heard of it from deserters and told Mardonius. He, at once, whether through fear of the Athenian or out of ambition to engage with the Lacedaemonians, counterchanged his Persians to the right wing, and ordered the Hellenes with him to set themselves against the Athenians. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:16" n="6"><p> When this change in his enemy’s order of battle was manifest, Pausanias returned and occupied the right wing again, whereupon Mardonius also resumed his own left wing, just as he stood at the beginning, facing the Lacedaemonians. And thus the day came to an end without action. The Hellenes, on deliberation, decided to change their camp to a position farther on, and to secure a spot where there was plenty of good water, since the neighboring springs were defiled and ruined by the Barbarians’ superior force of cavalry.  </p></div></div>

The soldiers, however, showed no great eagerness to follow in close order, but when they had once abandoned their first defences, most of them hurried on toward the city of Plataea, and there tumult reigned as they scattered about and encamped in no order whatsoever. But it chanced that the Lacedaemonians were left alone behind the others, and that too against their will. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:17" n="2"><p> For Amompharetus, a man of a fierce and venturesome spirit, who had long been mad for battle and distressed by the many postponements and delays, now at last lost all control of himself, denounced the change of position as a runaway flight, and declared that he would not abandon his post, but stay there with his company and await the onset of Mardonius. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:17" n="3"><p> And when Pausanias came up and told him that their action had been formally voted by the Hellenes in council, Amompharetus picked up a great stone and threw it down at the feet of Pausanias, saying that was his personal ballot for battle, and he cared not a whit for the cowardly counsels and votes of the rest. Pausanias, perplexed at the case, sent to the Athenians, who were already moving off, begging them to wait and make the march in company with him, and then began to lead the rest of his troops toward Plataea, with the idea that he would thus force Amompharetus from his position. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:17" n="4"><p>  At this point day overtook them, and Mardonius, who did not fail to notice that the Hellenes had abandoned their encampment, with his force in full array, bore down upon the Lacedaemonians, with great shouting and clamor on the part of the Barbarians, who felt that there would be no real battle, but that the Hellenes had only to be snatched off as they fled. And this lacked but little of coming to pass. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:17" n="5"><p> For Pausanias, on seeing the situation, though he did check his march and order every man to take post for battle, forgot, either in his rage at Amompharetus or his confusion at the speed of the enemy, to give the signal for battle to the confederate Hellenes. For this reason they did not come to his aid at once, nor in a body, but in small detachments and straggling, after the battle was already joined. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:17" n="6"><p>  When Pausanias got no favorable omens from his sacrifices, he ordered his Lacedaemonians to sit quiet with their shields planted in front of them, and to await his orders, making no attempt to repulse their enemies, while he himself went to sacrificing again. By this time the horsemen were charging upon them; presently their missiles actually reached them, and many a Spartan was smitten. </p></div>

Their experience was indeed a terrible one, but the restraint of the men was wonderful. They did not try to repel the enemy who were attacking them, but awaited from their god and their general the favorable instant, while they endured wounds and death at their posts. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:17" n="8"><p> Some say that as Pausanias was sacrificing and praying, a little to one side of his line of battle, some Lydians suddenly fell upon him and rudely hurled away the sacrificial offerings; and that Pausanias and his attendants, being without weapons, smote the intruders with the sacrificial staves and goads; wherefore, to this day, in imitation of this onslaught, the ceremonies of beating the young warriors round the altar at Sparta, and of the procession of the Lydians which follows this, are duly celebrated as rites.  </p></div></div>

The Barbarians then got assurance that their contest was to be with men who would fight to the death. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:18" n="3"><p> Therefore they made a rampart of their wicker targets and shot their arrows into the ranks of the Lacedaemonians. These, however, kept their shields closely locked together as they advanced, fell upon their foemen, tore away their wicker targets, and then, smiting the Persians in face and breast with their long spears, they slew many, who nevertheless did great deeds of courage before they fell. For they grasped the long spears with their naked hands, fractured them for the most part, and then took to short-range fighting with a will, plying their daggers and scimetars, tearing away their enemies’ shields, and locking them in close embrace; and so they held out a long time. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:18" n="4"><p>  The Athenians, meanwhile, were quietly awaiting the Lacedaemonians. But when the shouts of those engaged in battle fell loud upon their ears, and there came, as they say, a messenger from Pausanias telling them what was happening, they set out with speed to aid him. However, as they were advancing through the plain to his aid, the medising Hellenes bore down upon them. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:21" n="3"><p> and following all, the chief magistrate of Plataea, who may not at other times touch iron or put on any other raiment than white, at this time is robed in a purple tunic, carries on high a water-jar from the city’s archive chamber, and proceeds, sword in hand, through the midst of the city to the graves; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:21" n="4"><p> there he takes water from the sacred spring, washes off with his own hands the gravestones, and anoints them with myrrh; then he slaughters the bull at the funeral pyre, and, with prayers to Zeus and Hermes Terrestrial, summons the brave men who died for Hellas to come to the banquet and its copious draughts of blood; next he mixes a mixer of wine, drinks, and then pours a libation from it, saying these words: <q type="spoken">I drink to the men who died for the freedom of the Hellenes.</q> These rites, I say, are observed by the Plataeans down to this very day.  </p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:22" n="1"><p>  After the Athenians had returned to their own city, Aristides saw that they desired to receive the more popular form of government. He thought the people worthy of consideration because of its sturdy valor, and he saw also that it was no longer easy to be forced out of its desires, since it was powerful in arms, and greatly elated by its victories. So he introduced a decree that the administration of the city be the privilege of all classes, and that the archons be chosen from all the Athenians. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:22" n="2"><p>  Themistocles once declared to the people that he had devised a certain measure which could not be revealed to them, though it would be helpful and salutary for the city, and they ordered that Aristides alone should hear what it was and pass judgment on it. So Themistocles told Aristides that his purpose was to burn the naval station of the confederate Hellenes, for that in this way the Athenians would be greatest, and lords of all. Then Aristides came before the people and said of the deed which Themistocles purposed to do, that none other could be more advantageous, and none more unjust. On hearing this, the Athenians ordained that Themistocles cease from his purpose.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Them. 20.1">Plut.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:23" n="1"><p>  When he was sent out as general along with Cimon to prosecute the war,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> 478 B.C.</note> and saw that Pausanias and the other Spartan commanders were offensive and severe to the allies, he made his own intercourse with them gentle and humane, and induced Cimon to be on easy terms with them and to take an actual part in their campaigns, so that before the Lacedaemonians were aware, not by means of hoplites or ships or horsemen, but by tact and diplomacy he had stripped them of the leadership. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:23" n="2"><p> For, well disposed as the Hellenes were toward the Athenians on account of the justice of Aristides and the reasonableness of Cimon, they were made to long for their supremacy still more by the rapacity of Pausanias and his severity. The commanders of the allies ever met with angry harshness at the hands of Pausanias, and the common men he punished with stripes, or by compelling them to stand all day long with an iron anchor on their shoulders. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:23" n="3"><p> No one could get bedding or fodder or go down to a spring for water before the Spartans, nay, their servants armed with goads would dive away such as approached. On these grounds Aristides once had it in mind to chide and admonish him, but Pausanias scowled, said he was busy, and would not listen. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:23" n="4"><p>  Subsequently the captains and generals of the Hellenes, and especially the Chians, Samians, and Lesbians, came to Aristides and tried to persuade him to assume the leadership and bring over to his support the allies, who had long wanted to be rid of the Spartans and to range themselves anew on the side of the Athenians. He replied that he saw the urgency and the justice of what they proposed, but that to establish Athenian confidence in them some overt act was needed, the doing of which would make it impossible for the multitude to change their allegiance back again. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:23" n="5"><p> So Uliades the Samian and Antagoras the Chian conspired together, and ran down the trireme of Pausanias off Byzantium, closing in on both sides of it as it was putting out before the line. When Pausanias saw what they had done, he sprang up and wrathfully threatened to show the world in a little while that these men had run down not so much his ship as their own native cities; but they bade him be gone, and be grateful to that fortune which fought in his favour at Plataea; it was because the Hellenes still stood in awe of this, they said, that they did not punish him as he deserved. And finally they went off and joined the Athenians. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:23" n="6"><p>  Then indeed was the lofty wisdom of the Spartans made manifest in a wonderful way. When they saw that their commanders were corrupted by the great powers entrusted to them, they voluntarily abandoned the leadership and ceased sending out generals for the war, choosing rather to have their citizens discreet and true to their ancestral customs than to have the sway over all Hellas.  </p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:24" n="1"><p>  The Hellenes used to pay a sort of contribution for the war even while the Lacedaemonians had the leadership, but now they wished to be assessed equably city by city. So they asked the Athenians for Aristides, and commissioned him to inspect their several territories and revenues,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> 478-477 B.C.</note> and then to fix the assessments according to each member’s worth and ability to pay. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:24" n="2"><p> And yet, though he became master of such power, and though after a fashion Hellas put all her property in his sole hands, poor as he was when he went forth on this mission, he came back from it poorer still, and he made his assessments of money not only with purity and justice, but also to the grateful satisfaction and convenience of all concerned. Indeed, as men of old hymned the praises of the age of Cronus—the golden age, so did the allies of the Athenians praise the tariff of Aristides, calling it a kind of blessed happening for Hellas, especially as, after a short time, it was doubled and then again trebled. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:24" n="3"><p> For the tax which Aristides laid amounted to four hundred and sixty talents only; but Pericles must have added almost a third to this, since Thucydides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Thuc. 2.13">Thuc. 2.13</bibl> </note> says that when the war began the Athenians had a revenue of six hundred talents from their allies. And after the death of Pericles the demagogues enlarged it little by little, and at last brought the sum total up to thirteen hundred talents, not so much because the war, by reason of its length and vicissitudes, became extravagantly expensive, as because they themselves led the people off into the distribution of public moneys for spectacular entertainments, and for the erection of images and sanctuaries. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:24" n="4"><p>  So then Aristides had a great and admirable name for his adjustment of the revenues. But Themistocles is said to have ridiculed him, claiming that the praise he got therefor was not fit for a man, but rather for a mere money-wallet. He came off second best, however, in this retort upon the plain speech of Aristides, who had remarked, when Themistocles once declared to him the opinion that the greatest excellence in a general was the anticipation of the plans of his enemies: <q type="spoken">That is indeed needful, Themistocles, but the honorable thing, and that which makes the real general, is his mastery over his fingers.</q>  </p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:25" n="1"><p>  Aristides did, indeed, bind the Hellenes by an oath, and took oath himself for the Athenians, to mark his imprecations casting iron ingots into the sea; but afterwards, when circumstances, forsooth, compelled a more strenuous sway, he bade the Athenians lay the perjury to his own charge, and turn events to their own advantage. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:25" n="2"><p> And in general, as Theophrastus tells us, while the man was strictly just in his private relations to his fellow-citizens, in public matters he often acted in accordance with the policy which his country had adopted, feeling that this required much actual injustice. For instance, he says that when the question of removing the moneys of the confederacy from Delos to Athens,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> 454 B.C.</note> contrary to the compacts, was being debated, and even the Samians proposed it, Aristides declared that it was unjust, but advantageous. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:25" n="3"><p> And yet, although he at last established his city in its sway over so many men, he himself abode by his poverty, and continued to be no less content with the reputation he got from being a poor man, than with that based on his trophies of victory. This is clear from the following story.  Callias the Torch-bearer was a kinsman of his. This man was prosecuted by his enemies on a capital charge, and after they had brought only moderate accusations against him within the scope of their indictment, they went outside of it and appealed to the judges as follows: </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:25" n="4"><p> <q type="spoken">You know Aristides the son of Lysimachus,</q> they said, <q type="spoken">how he is admired in Hellas; what do you suppose his domestic circumstances are when you see him entering the public assembly in such a scanty cloak as that? Is it not likely that a man who shivers in public goes hungry at home, and is straitened for the other necessaries of life? Callias, however, who is the richest man of Athens (and his cousin at that), allows him to suffer want with his wife and children, though he has often had service of the man, and many times reaped advantage from his influence with you.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:25" n="5"><p> But Callias, seeing that his judges were very turbulent at this charge, and bitterly disposed toward him, summoned Aristides and demanded his testimony before the judges that though often proffered aid from him and importuned to accept it, he had refused it, with the answer that it more became him to be proud of his poverty than Callias of his wealth; for many were to be seen who use wealth well or ill, but it was not easy to find a man who endured poverty with a noble spirit; and those only should be ashamed of poverty who could not be otherwise than poor. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:25" n="6"><p> When Aristides had borne this witness for Callias, there was no one of his hearers who did not go home preferring to be poor with Aristides rather than to be rich with Callias. This, at any rate, is the story told by Aeschines the Socratic. And Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 518">Plat. Gorg. 518f</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 526">Plat. Gorg. 526</bibl>.</note> maintains that of all those who had great names and reputations at Athens, this man alone was worthy of regard. Themistocles, he says, and Cimon, and Pericles, filled the city with porches and moneys and no end of nonsense; but Aristides squared his politics with virtue. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:25" n="7"><p>  There are also strong proofs of his reasonableness to be seen in his treatment of Themistocles. This man he had found to be his foe during almost all his public service, and it was through this man that he was ostracized; but when Themistocles was in the same plight, and was under accusation before the city, Aristides remembered no evil; nay, though Alcmeon and Cimon and many others denounced and persecuted the man, Aristides alone did and said no meanness, nor did he take any advantage of his enemy’s misfortune, just as formerly he did not grudge him his prosperity.  </p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:26" n="1"><p>  As touching the death of Aristides, some say he died in Pontus, on an expedition in the public service; others at Athens, of old age, honored and admired by his countrymen. But Craterus the Macedonian tells something like this about the death of the man. After the exile of Themistocles, he says, the people waxed wanton, as it were, and produced a great crop of sycophants, who hounded down the noblest and most influential men, and subjected them to the malice of the multitude, now exalted with its prosperity and power. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:26" n="2"><p> Among these he says that Aristides also was convicted of bribery, on prosecution of Diophantus of the deme Amphitrope, for having taken money from the Ionians when he was regulating the tributes; and, further, that being unable to pay the judgment, which was fifty minas, he sailed away and died somewhere in Ionia. But Craterus furnishes no documentary proof of this,—no judgment of the court, no degree of indictment,—although he is wont to record such things with all due fullness, and to adduce his authorities. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:26" n="3"><p>  All the rest, as I may venture to say,—all who rehearse the shortcomings of the people in dealing with their leaders,—compile and descant upon the exile of Themistocles, the imprisonment of Miltiades, the fine of Pericles, the death of Paches in the court room,—he slew himself on the rostrum when he saw that he was convicted,—and many such a case, and they put into the list the ostracism of Aristides, but of such a condemnation as this for bribery they make no mention whatsoever.  </p></div></div>

And they tell how his daughters were married from the prytaneium at the public cost, the city bestowing the dowry for the marriage and voting outright three thousand drachmas to each daughter, while to Lysimachus his son, the people gave one hundred minas in silver, as many acres of vineyard land, and besides this a pension of four drachmas per diem, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:27" n="2"><p> —all in a bill which was brought in by Alcibiades. And further, Lysimachus left a daughter, Polycrite, according to Callisthenes, and the people voted for her a public maintenance, in the style of their Olympic victors. Again, Demetrius the Phalerean, Hieronymus the Rhodian, Aristoxenus the Musician, and Aristotle (provided the book <q type="title">On Nobility of Birth</q> is to be ranked among the genuine works of Aristotle) relate that Myrto, the granddaughter of Aristides, lived in wedlock with Socrates the Sage. He had another woman to wife, but took this one up because her poverty kept her a widow, and she lacked the necessaries of life. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:27" n="3"><p> To these, however, Panaetius, in his work on Socrates, has made sufficient reply.  And the Phalerean says, in his <q type="title">Socrates,</q> that he remembers a grandson of Aristides, Lysimachus, a very poor man, who made his own living by means of a sort of dream-interpreting tablet, his seat being near the so-called Iaccheium. To this man’s mother and to her sister, Demetrius persuaded the people to give, by formal decree, a pension of three obols per diem; though afterwards, in his capacity of sole legislator, he himself, as he says, assigned a drachma instead of three obols to each of the women. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg024.perseus-eng2:27" n="4"><p>  It is not to be wondered at that the people took such thought for families in the city, since on learning that the granddaughter of Aristogeiton was living humbly in Lemnos, unmarried because of her poverty, they brought her back to Athens, consorted her with a well-born man, and gave her the estate in Potamus for her dowry. For such humanity and benevolence, of which the city still gives illustrious examples even in my own day, she is justly admired and lauded.  </p></div></div> </div>
