<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"><head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent">The <title rend="italic">Greek and Roman Parallel Stories</title> (sometimes called the <title rend="italic">Parallela Minora</title>) are a puzzle.

Schmid, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der Atticismus</title>, iii. pp. 147 ff.</note> for the usual pronoun of reference (though this is, to be sure, a prominent characteristic of the work of Polybius), and above all the atrocious style in which the work is written make it impossible that this could reasonably be regarded as the work of Plutarch,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Contrariwise see Parthenius, translated by S. Gaselee, in the L.C.L. p. 289 note.</note> though some scholars, fortunately unknown to Hartman, have actually regarded this work as one of the sins of Plutarch’s otherwise stainless youth. </p> <p rend="indent">Yet a work of this name is included in Lamprias’s list, No. 128 under the title <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διηγήσεις Παράλληλοι Ἑλληνικαὶ καὶ Ῥωμαϊκαὶ</foreign> and several of these tales are quoted in full<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Only the first, however, is assigned to Plutarch.</note> in almost the exact words of our ms. text by Joannes Stobaeus. But the excessive ineptitude of the language quite excludes the possibility that the work before us can be Plutarch’s, if indeed he ever wrote a book of this sort. </p> <p rend="indent">S. Luria,in <emph>Rheinisches Museum</emph>, lxxviii. (1929) p. 94, <pb xml:id="v.4.p.254"/> has suggested that the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Parallela</title> and the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Fluviis</title> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bernardakis’s ed. vol. vii. pp. 282-328.</note> are parodies after the manner of Lucian’s <title rend="italic">True History</title>; and both Hercher and Hartman have expressed the opinion that both works are by the same anonymous author, chiefly because it is difficult to imagine thato such fools as the author of each discloses himself to be could ever have lived ! The confusion that the author (ingeniously?) introduces, the forced simplicity of his glaring misnomers, his many references to authorities that Hercher<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Plutarchi libellus de fluviis</title> (Leipzig, 1851). Schlereth, however, has severely criticized Hercher’s conclusions.

It has not been thought worth while to include in the notes the references to Müller, since no additional information is to be found there. All the references, however, will be found in the recent Teubner edition.</note> all have been thought to suggest that the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Parallela</title> is a parody of the comparisons in the <title rend="italic">Lives</title>; but J. Schlereth, in his excellent dissertation <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarchi quae feruntur Parallela Minora</title> (Freiburg, 1931), has with great learning and acumen attempted to disprove this thesis.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">It must be noted that many of the points which Plutarch has selected for comparison in the <title rend="italic">Lives</title>, that is, in the so-called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συγκρίσεις</foreign>, are very tenuous, not to say inept. They would lend themselves readily to parody. On the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύγκρισις</foreign> see further F. Focke, <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, lviii. pp. 327 ff.</note> His work may be consulted by anyone who may be curious about the sources, the language, or the purpose of the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Parallela Minora</title>. </p> <p rend="indent">Wilhelm Schmid (<title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Philologische Wochenschrift</title> 1932, coll. 625-634) has reviewed Schlereth’s work with great care. Both Schmid and Nachstädt hold that the citations from otherwise unknown authors are <pb xml:id="v.4.p.255"/> genuine, not falsifications of the compiler. Nachstädt, accordingly in the Teubner edition of 1934, gives all the references, and also adds, for convenient comparison, the most important passages from Stobaeus, Lydus, and a <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">gnomologicum Parisinum</title>, published by Sternbach in 1893, which seem to have the same original as the text of the present work. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.257"/>

But since I have discovered that similar events have happened in this modern era, I have singled out crises of Roman history; and, to parallel each ancient happening, I have subjoined a more modern instance. I have also recorded my authorities.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Datis, the Persian satrap, came to Marathon, a plain of Attica, with an army of three hundred thousand, encamped there, and declared war on the inhabitants of the country. The Athenians, however, contemning the barbarian host, sent out nine thousand men, and appointed as generals Cynegeirus, Polyzelus, Callimachus, and Miltiades. When this force had engaged the enemy, Polyzelus, having seen a supernatural vision, lost his sight, and became blind. Callimachus was pierced with so many spears that, dead though he was, he stood upright<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Contrast Lucan, iv. 787 <q> <foreign xml:lang="lat">compressum turba stetit omne cadaver</foreign> </q>; Ammianus Marcellinus, xviii. 8. 12.</note>; and Cynegeirus, seizing hold of a Persian ship that was putting out to sea, had his hand chopped off.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, vi. 114; Stobaeus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Florilegium</title>, vii. 63 (iii. p. 328 Hense).</note> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.259"/> </p> <p rend="indent">Hasdrubal the king seized Sicily and declared war on the Romans. Metellus was elected general by the Senate and was victor in the battle in which Lucius Glauco, a patrician, seizing hold of Hasdrubal’s ship, lost both his hands. This Aristeides the Milesian relates iii the first book of his <title rend="italic">Sicilian History</title>; from him Dionysius Siculus learned the facts. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">Xerxes with five million men anchored near Artemisium and declared war on the inhabitants. The Athenians were in confusion and sent Agesilaüs, the brother of Themistocles, as a spy, although his father Neocles had seen in a dream his son deprived of both his hands. Agesilaüs, arriving among the barbarians in Persian garb, slew Mardonius, one of the king’s bodyguards, supposing him to be Xerxes. He was arrested by the bystanders and led in bonds to the king. The aforesaid king was about to offer sacrifice at the altar of the Sun, and Agesilaüs placed his right hand upon the altar; and when he had endured the cruel torture without a groan, he was freed from his bonds, whereupon he declared, <q>All we Athenians are men of this sort; if you do not believe me, I will place my left hand also on the altar.</q> Xerxes was frightened and gave command that he be kept under guard.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Stobaeus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Florilegium</title>, vii. 64 (iii. p. 330 Hense).</note> This Agatharchides the Samian relates in the second book of his <title rend="italic">Persian History</title>. </p> <p rend="indent">Porsenna, king of the Etruscans, made a foray on the other side of the river Tiber and warred against the Romans; he intercepted their abundant supply <pb xml:id="v.4.p.261"/> of grain and oppressed the aforesaid with famine.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This passage is repeated in 307 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> The senate was in confusion; but Mucius one of the nobles, with the consuls’ authorization, took four hundred men of his own age in civilian dress, and crossed the river. He observed one of the tyrant’s bodyguards distributing provisions to the officers and, supposing him to be Porsenna, killed him. When he was led to the king, he put forth his right hand into the sacrificial fire; and dissembling his torments with a stout heart, he said with a smile, <q>Ruffian, I am free, whether you will or no. Know that there are against you even now in your camp four hundred of us that seek to slay you.</q> Porsenna was frightened, and made a truce with the Romans.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Livy, ii. 12.</note> This Aristeides the Milesian relates in the third book of his <title rend="italic">Histories</title>. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">When Argives and Spartans were contending for the Thyreatis, the Amphictyonic Assembly decreed that three hundred of each should fight, and the country should belong to the victors. The Spartans accordingly made Othryades their general, and the Argives made Thersander theirs. In the battle two of the Argives survived, Agenor and Chromius, who brought to their city the report of their victory. But when the battlefield was deserted, Othryades revived and, supporting himself on spear-shafts broken in two, despoiled and stripped the corpses of their shields; and when he had erected a trophy, he wrote <pb xml:id="v.4.p.263"/> with his own blood upon it: <q>To Zeus, Guardian of Trophies.</q> And when the two peoples still disputed over the victory, the Amphictyonic Assembly, after a personal inspection of the battlefield, decided in favour of the Spartans.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, i. 82; Stobaeus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Florilegium</title>, vii. 68 (iii. p. 333, Hense); Valerius Maximus, iii. 2. ext. 4. Stobaeus quotes the story on the authority of Theseus, and, while his account has quite the same context, there is a great difference in wording.</note> Thus Chrysermus in the third book of his <title rend="italic">Peloponnesian History.</title> </p> <p rend="indent">The Romans in a war with the Samnites elected Postumius Albinus general.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">He as consul 321 b.c. accodring to Livy, ix. 1. ff., but his death after his defeat was not so dramatic as is here depicted.</note> He was ambushed at a place called the Caudine Forks (it is a very narrow pass) and lost three legions, and himself fell mortally wounded. But in the dead of night he revived for a little and despoiled the enemy’s corpses of their shields. With these he set up a trophy and, dipping his hand in his blood, wrote upon it: <q>The Romans from the Samnites to Jupiter Feretrius.</q> But Maximus, surnamed the Glutton,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Gurges; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Macrobius, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Saturnalia</title>, iii. 13. 6.</note> was dispatched as general and when he had come to the place and had seen the trophy, he gladly accepted the omen. He attacked the enemy and conquered, and taking their king prisoner, sent him to Rome. Thus Aristeides the Milesian in the third book of his <title rend="italic">Italian Histories</title>. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">When the Persians were marching with five million men against Greece, Leonidas was sent by the Spartans to Thermopylae with three hundred men.

He attacked the enemy and lost all his men, but he himself, although mortally wounded, with a mad rush reached Hannibal and knocked down his crown, and so died with him. This Aristeides the Milesian relates. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">At the city of Celaenae in Phrygia the earth yawned open, together with a heavy rain, and dragged down many homesteads with their inhabitants into the depths. Midas the king received an oracle that if he should throw his most precious possession into the abyss, it would close. He cast in gold and silver, but this availed nothing. But Anchurus, the son of Midas, reasoning that there is nothing in life more precious than a human life, embraced his father and his wife Timothea, and rode on his horse into the abyss. When the earth had closed, Midas made an altar of Idaean Zeus golden <pb xml:id="v.4.p.267"/> by a touch of his hand.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The <q>golden touch</q> of Midas.</note> This altar becomes stone at that time of the year when this yawning of the earth occurred; but when this limit of time has passed, it is seen to be golden.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Stobaeus, vii. 66 (iii. 331 Hense).</note> So Callisthenes in the second book of his <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>. </p> <p rend="indent">Because of the wrath of Jupiter Tarpeius<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, Capitolinus (<foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign> Ovid, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Fasti</title>, vi. 34).</note> the Tiber coursed through the middle of the Forum, broke open a very large abyss and engulfed many houses. An oracle was given that this would end if they threw in their precious possession. As they were casting in gold and silver. Curtius, a youth of noble family, apprehended the meaning of the oracle, and, reasoning that human life is more precious, he hurled himself on horseback into the abyss, and saved his people from their miseries.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Livy, vii. 6; or Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <title rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</title>, xiv. 11.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">When the captains that accompanied Polyneices were feasting, an eagle swooped down and carried the spear of Amphiaraüs up to a height and then let it drop. The spear became fixed in the earth and was changed into a laurel. The next day, when the captains were fighting, at that very spot Amphiaraüs was swallowed up with his chariot, where now is the city that is called Harma.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <q>City of the Chariot</q>; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Pausanias, ix. 19. 4, and the scholium on Clement of Alexandria, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Protrepticus</title>, ii. 11. 1.</note> So Trisimachus in the third book of his <title rend="italic">Founding of Cities.</title> </p> <p rend="indent">When the Romans were fighting against Pyrrhus of Epeirus, Aemilius Paulus received an oracle that he should be victorious if he would build an altar where <pb xml:id="v.4.p.269"/> he should see a man of the nobles with his chariot swallowed up in an abyss. Three days later Valerius Conatus in a dream saw a vision which commanded him to don his priestly raiment (he was, in fact, an expert augur). When he had led forth his men and slain many of the enemy, he was swallowed up by the earth. Aemilius built an altar, gained a victory, and sent back an hundred and sixty turreted elephants to Rome. The altar delivers oracles at that time of year when Pyrrhus was vanquished. This Critolaüs relates in the third book of his <title rend="italic" >Epeirote History</title>. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">Pyraechmes, king of the Euboeans, was at war with the Boeotians. Heracles, while still a youth, vanquished him. He tied Pyraechmes to colts, tore his body into two parts, and cast it forth unburied. The place is called <q>Colts of Pyraechmes.</q> It is situated beside the river Heracleius, and it gives forth a sound of neighing when horses drink of it.

And Tullus repeatedly postponed battle. But the Albans, assuming his defeat, betook themselves to feasting and drinking. When they were overcome by wine, Tullus attacked them, and, tying their king to two colts, tore him apart.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Livy, i. 28, <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad fin.</foreign> or Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <title rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</title>, iii. 30, <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad fin.</foreign> </note> So Alexarchus in the fourth book of his <title rend="italic">Italian History.</title> </p> </div>

He then taught Icarius the use of wine and viniculture, <pb xml:id="v.4.p.273"/> and told him that he should share his knowledge with his neighbours also. When the neighbours did so and drank more than is customary, they fell into an unusually deep sleep. Imagining that they had been poisoned, they pelted Icarius with stones and killed him; and his grandchildren in despair ended their lives by hanging themselves. When a plague had gained a wide hold among the Romans, Apollo gave an oracle that it would cease if they should appease the wrath of Saturn and the spirits of those who had perished unlawfully. Lutatius Catulus, one of the nobles, built for the god the precinct which lies near the Tarpeian Rock. He made the upper altar with four faces, either because of Icarius’s grandchildren or because the year has four parts; and he designated a month January. Saturn placed them all among the stars.

But Laïus the Theban conceived a desire for him and carried him off; and, although he was arrested by Thyestes and Atreus, he obtained mercy from Pelops because of his love. But Hippodameia tried to persuade Atreus and Thyestes to do away with Chrysippus, <pb xml:id="v.4.p.305"/> since she knew that he would be a contestant for the kingship; but when they refused, she stained her hands with the pollution. For at dead of night, when Laïus was asleep, she drew his sword, wounded Chrysippus, and fixed the sword in his body. Laïus was suspected because of the sword, but was saved by Chrysippus who, though half-dead, acknowledged the truth.

The maiden understood the import: she sacrificed the heifer, took up the hammer, and went about from house to house, tapping the sick lightly with her hammer and rousing them, bidding each of them to be well again; whence even to this day this mystic rite is performed.
