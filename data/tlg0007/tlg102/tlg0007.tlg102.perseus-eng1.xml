            <head>ON BEING A BUSYBODY
					(DE CURIOSITATE)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					This essay, which was apparently written only a short
					time before <hi rend="italics">De Garrulitate</hi>,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">And no doubt also before <hi rend="italics">De Tranquillitate</hi> (so rightly Brokate).</note> has much the same
					interest and charm as that pleasant work. The
					essays are akin in many ways ; portions of the later
					treatise are merely a reshaping of ideas and commonplaces which the earlier had adumbrated.
				</p>
            <p>
					The source of much of this work has been traced to
					Ariston of Chios by O. Hense (<hi rend="italics">Rhein. Mus.</hi>,x Iv. 541 if.);
					and F. Krauss<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Die Rhetorischen Schriften Plutarchs</hi>, Munich Diss., NÃ¼rnberg, 1912, pp. 67 ff. See also the interesting table (p. 87) of rhetorical figures which places our essay in the very centre of Plutarch's literary activity.</note> has shown with some success the
					relation to diatribe literature.
				</p>
            <p>
					The essay was already known to Aulus Gellius
					(xi. 16), who speaks with feeling of the difficulty of
					rendering <foreign xml:lang="greek">polupragmosu/nh</foreign> in Latin<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">It is hard to render it in English also. The translator uses the word <q>curiosity</q> - Ed.</note>; nor has it been
					unknown to English moralists. Jeremy Taylor has
					again borrowed largely from it in his <hi rend="italics">Holy Living</hi>, ii. 5.
				</p>
            <p>
					In the translation of this and the preceding essay
					I am greatly indebted to Mr. Tucker's<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Select Essays of Plutarch</hi>, Oxford, Clarendon, 1913.</note> spirited version, from which I have taken numerous phrases and
					sometimes whole sentences.
				</p>
            <p>
					The work is No. 97 in the Lamprias catalogue.

            <p>It is perhaps best to avoid a house which has no
					ventilation, or is gloomy, or cold in winter, or unhealthy ; yet if familiarity has made you fond of
					the place, it is possible to make it brighter, better
					ventilated, and healthier by altering the lights, shifting the stairs, and opening some doors and closing
					others. Even some cities have gained by such
					changes. So in the case of my own town,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Chaeroneia</note> which used
					to face the west and receive the full force of the sun
					in the late afternoon from Parnassus, they say that
					it was turned by Chaeron to face the east. And
					Empedocles,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Diels, <hi rend="italics">Frag. d. Vorsokratiker</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>, i. p. 284, A 14; <hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 1126 b.</note> the natural philosopher, by blocking
					up a certain mountain gorge, which permitted the
					south wind to blow a dire and pestilential draught
					down upon the plains, was thought to have shut
					plague out of his country.
				</p>
            <p>
					Since, then, there are certain unhealthy and injurious states of mind which allow winter and darkness to enter the soul, it is better to thrust these out
					and to make a clean sweep to the foundations, thus
					giving to ourselves a clear sky and light and pure air ;
					but if that is impossible, it is best at least to interchange and readjust them in some way or other,
					turning or shifting them about.
					<pb n="v.6.p.475"/>
				        </p>
            <p>
					Such a malady of the mind, to take the first instance,
					is curiosity, which is a desire to learn the troubles of
					others,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Menander's typical curious slave, a <foreign xml:lang="greek">polupra/gmwn</foreign>, who says (Frag. 850 Kock): <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)de\n gluku/tero/n e)stin h)\ pa/nt' ei)de/nai</foreign>.</note> a disease which is thought to be free from
					neither envy nor malice :
					<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>Why do you look so sharp on others' ills,

                  <l>Malignant man, yet overlook your own?<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Kock, <hi rend="italics">Com. Att. Frag.</hi>, iii. p. 476, ades. 359; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 469 b, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note>
                  </l>
               </quote>
					Shift your curiosity from things without and turn it
					inwards ; if you enjoy dealing with the recital of
					troubles, you have much occupation at home :
					<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>Great as the water flowing down Alizon,

               </quote>
					so great a quantity of transgressions will you find in
					your own life, of afflictions in your own soul, of oversights in the performance of your own obligations.
				</p>
            <p>
					For as Xenophon<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Oeconomicus</hi>, viii. 19, 20.</note> says that good householders
					have a special place for sacrificial utensils, and a
					special place for dinner-ware, and that farming implements should be stored elsewhere, and apart from
					them the weapons of war; even so in your own case
					you have one store of faults arising from envy, another
					from jealousy, another from cowardice, another from
					pettiness. Assault these, examine these! Block up
					the windows and the side-doors of your curiosity that
					open on your neighbours' property, and open up
					others leading to your own-to the men's quarters,
					to the women's quarters, to the living-rooms of your
					servants! Here this curiosity and meddlesomeness
					of yours will have an occupation not unhelpful or

					they say, when at home sleeps in blindness with her

					our dealings with others abroad, puts his meddlesomeness, like an eye, into his maliciousness ; but
					we are often tripped up by our own faults and vices
					by reason of our ignorance of them, since we provide
					ourselves with no sight or light by which to inspect
					them. Therefore the busybody is also more useful
					to his enemies than to himself,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 87 b-c.</note> for he rebukes and

					refused to converse even with his mother until he
					had learned from the seer<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Teiresias.</note> the matters by reason
					of which he had come to the House of Hades ; and
					when he had his answer, he both turned to his mother

                  <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi>, xi. 229 ff.</note> asking

					But we, while treating our own affairs with considerable laxity and ignorance and neglect, pry into the
					pedigrees of the rest of the world : our neighbour's
					grandfather was a Syrian and his grandmother a
					Thracian<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">That is, both were probably slaves.</note>; so-and-so owes three talents and has not
					paid the interest. We inquire also into such matters

                  <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi>, where she had been.</note> and
					what A and B's private conversation in the corner was
					about. Yet Socrates went about seeking to solve the
					question of what arguments Pythagoras used to carry
					conviction ; and Aristippus, when he met Ischomachus at Olympia, asked him by what manner of
					conversation Socrates succeeded in so affecting the
					young men. And when Aristippus had gleaned a
					few odd seeds and samples of Socrates' talk, he was
					so moved that he suffered a physical collapse and
					became quite pale and thin. Finally he sailed for
					Athens and slaked his burning thirst with draughts
					from the fountain-head, and engaged in a study of the
					man and his words and his philosophy, of which the
					end and aim was to come to recognize one's own
					vices and so rid oneself of them.

					in the same way busybodies, passing over topics and
					narratives which are in plain view and matters concerning which no one prevents their inquiring or is
					vexed if inquiry is made, pick out the hidden and
					obscure troubles of every household. And yet it was
					surely a clever answer that the Egyptian gave to the
					man who asked him what he was carrying wrapped
					up : <q>That's why it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> wrapped up.</q> And why,
					if you please, are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> inquisitive about what is concealed? If it were not something bad, it would not
					be concealed. Yet it is not customary to walk into
					the house of someone else without at least first knocking on the door; but nowadays there are doormen and
					formerly there were knockers to be struck at the
					door and give warning, so that the stranger might not
					catch the mistress of the house or the unmarried
					daughter unawares, or a slave being punished or the
					maid-servants screaming. But it is for these very
					things that the busybody slips in. A sober and respectable household he would not willingly enter as a
					spectator even if he were invited to come ; but the
					matters to conceal which keys and bolts and streetdoors are used-these are what he uncovers and
					communicates to outsiders. And yet <q>the winds
						with which we are most vexed,</q> as Ariston<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Von Arnim, <hi rend="italics">Stoic. Vet. Frag.</hi>, i. pp. 89-90, Frag. 401.</note> says,
					<q>are those which pull up our garments,</q> but the
					busybody strips off not only the mantles and tunics
					of those near him, but also their very walls ; he
					flings the doors wide open and makes his way, like

					joy of a prosperous king is not concealed, nor is his
					laughter when he is amused, nor his outlay on entertainment and favours ; but it is time for alarm when
					something is hidden, something dark, unsmiling, unapproachable, a storehouse of festering wrath, or the
					meditation of a punishment indicative of sullen anger,
					or jealousy of a wife, or some suspicion against a son,
					or distrust of a friend. Beware of this darkening
