			<head>ON BEING A BUSYBODY (<foreign xml:lang="lat">DE CURIOSITATE</foreign>)</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent">This essay, which was apparently written only a short time before <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Garrulitate</title>,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">And no doubt also before <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Tranquillitate</title> (so rightly Brokate).</note> has much the same interest and charm as that pleasant work. The essays are akin in many ways; portions of the later treatise are merely a reshaping of ideas and commonplaces which the earlier had adumbrated.</p>
<p rend="indent">The source of much of this work has been traced to Ariston of Chios by O. Hense (<title rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.</title>,x Iv. 541 if.); and F. Krauss<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Die Rhetorischen Schriften Plutarchs</title>, Munich Diss., Nürnberg, 1912, pp. 67 ff. See also the interesting table (p. 87) of rhetorical figures which places our essay in the very centre of Plutarch’s literary activity.</note> has shown with some success the relation to diatribe literature.</p>
<p rend="indent">The essay was already known to Aulus Gellius (xi. 16), who speaks with feeling of the difficulty of rendering <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυπραγμοσύνη</foreign> in Latin<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">It is hard to render it in English also. The translator uses the word <q>curiosity</q> - Ed.</note>; nor has it been unknown to English moralists. Jeremy Taylor has again borrowed largely from it in his <title rend="italic">Holy Living</title>, ii. 5.</p>
<p rend="indent">In the translation of this and the preceding essay I am greatly indebted to Mr. Tucker’s<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Select Essays of Plutarch</title>, Oxford, Clarendon, 1913.</note> spirited version, from which I have taken numerous phrases and sometimes whole sentences.</p>
<p rend="indent">The work is No. 97 in the Lamprias catalogue. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.6.p.473"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">It is perhaps best to avoid a house which has no ventilation, or is gloomy, or cold in winter, or unhealthy; yet if familiarity has made you fond of the place, it is possible to make it brighter, better ventilated, and healthier by altering the lights, shifting the stairs, and opening some doors and closing others. Even some cities have gained by such changes. So in the case of my own town,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true" xml:lang="lat">Chaeroneia</note> which used to face the west and receive the full force of the sun in the late afternoon from Parnassus, they say that it was turned by Chaeron to face the east. And Empedocles,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. d. Vorsokratiker</title> <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>, i. p. 284, A 14; <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">cf. Moralia</title>, 1126 b.</note> the natural philosopher, by blocking up a certain mountain gorge, which permitted the south wind to blow a dire and pestilential draught down upon the plains, was thought to have shut plague out of his country.</p>
<p rend="indent">Since, then, there are certain unhealthy and injurious states of mind which allow winter and darkness to enter the soul, it is better to thrust these out and to make a clean sweep to the foundations, thus giving to ourselves a clear sky and light and pure air; but if that is impossible, it is best at least to interchange and readjust them in some way or other, turning or shifting them about. <pb xml:id="v.6.p.475"/></p>
<p rend="indent">Such a malady of the mind, to take the first instance, is curiosity, which is a desire to learn the troubles of others,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Menander’s typical curious slave, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυπράγμων</foreign>, who says (Frag. 850 Kock): <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεν γλυκύτερόν ἐστιν ἢ πάντ’ εἰδέναι.</foreign>.</note> a disease which is thought to be free from neither envy nor malice: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Why do you look so sharp on others’ ills, </l> <l>Malignant man, yet overlook your own?<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com. Att. Frag.</title>, iii. p. 476, ades. 359; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 469 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> </l> </quote> Shift your curiosity from things without and turn it inwards; if you enjoy dealing with the recital of troubles, you have much occupation at home: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Great as the water flowing down Alizon, </l> <l>Many as the leaves around the oak,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">A verse of unknown origin; the text is probably corrupt.</note> </l> </quote> so great a quantity of transgressions will you find in your own life, of afflictions in your own soul, of oversights in the performance of your own obligations.</p>
<p rend="indent">For as Xenophon<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Oeconomicus</title>, viii. 19, 20.</note> says that good householders have a special place for sacrificial utensils, and a special place for dinner-ware, and that farming implements should be stored elsewhere, and apart from them the weapons of war; even so in your own case you have one store of faults arising from envy, another from jealousy, another from cowardice, another from pettiness. Assault these, examine these! Block up the windows and the side-doors of your curiosity that open on your neighbours’ property, and open up others leading to your own-to the men’s quarters, to the women’s quarters, to the living-rooms of your servants! Here this curiosity and meddlesomeness of yours will have an occupation not unhelpful or <pb xml:id="v.6.p.477"/> malicious, but useful and salutary if each one will but say to himself, <quote rend="blockquote" >Where did I err? And what deed have I done? What duty neglected?<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><q>Pythagoras,</q> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Carmina Aurea</title>, 42; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 168 b.</note> </quote> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">But as it is, like the Lamia in the fable, who, they say, when at home sleeps in blindness with her eyes stored away in a jar, but when she goes abroad puts in her eyes and can see, so each one of us, in our dealings with others abroad, puts his meddlesomeness, like an eye, into his maliciousness; but we are often tripped up by our own faults and vices by reason of our ignorance of them, since we provide ourselves with no sight or light by which to inspect them. Therefore the busybody is also more useful to his enemies than to himself,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat"> Cf.<title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 87 b-c.</note> for he rebukes and drags out their faults and demonstrates to them what they should avoid or correct, but he neglects the greater part of his own domestic errors through his passionate interest in those abroad. So Odysseus<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Homer, <title rend="italic" >Od.</title>, xi. 88 ff.; Ps.-Lucian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Astrologia</title>, 24.</note> refused to converse even with his mother until he had learned from the seer<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Teiresias.</note> the matters by reason of which he had come to the House of Hades; and when he had his answer, he both turned to his mother and also made inquiries of the other women,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Od.</title>, xi. 229 ff.</note> asking who was Tyro, who the beautiful Chloris, why Epicaste met her death <quote rend="blockquote">Tying a noose, sheer-hung, from the high roof.<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Ibid.</foreign> 278; Epicaste is better known as Jocasta, the mother of Oedipus.</note> </quote> <pb xml:id="v.6.p.479"/> But we, while treating our own affairs with considerable laxity and ignorance and neglect, pry into the pedigrees of the rest of the world: our neighbour’s grandfather was a Syrian and his grandmother a Thracian<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true" >That is, both were probably slaves.</note>; so-and-so owes three talents and has not paid the interest. We inquire also into such matters as where so-and-so’s wife was coming back from,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">i.e.</foreign>, where she had been.</note> and what A and B’s private conversation in the corner was about. Yet Socrates went about seeking to solve the question of what arguments Pythagoras used to carry conviction; and Aristippus, when he met Ischomachus at Olympia, asked him by what manner of conversation Socrates succeeded in so affecting the young men. And when Aristippus had gleaned a few odd seeds and samples of Socrates’ talk, he was so moved that he suffered a physical collapse and became quite pale and thin. Finally he sailed for Athens and slaked his burning thirst with draughts from the fountain-head, and engaged in a study of the man and his words and his philosophy, of which the end and aim was to come to recognize one’s own vices and so rid oneself of them. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Yet there are some who cannot bear to face their own lives, regarding these as a most unlovely spectacle, or to reflect and revolve upon themselves, like a light, the power of reason, but their souls, being full of all manner of vices, shuddering and frightened at what is within, leap outwards and prowl about other people’s concerns and there batten and make fat their own malice. For as a domestic fowl will often, though its own food lies near at hand, slip into a corner and there scratch <pb xml:id="v.6.p.481"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Where one sole barley grain perhaps appears </l> <l>In the dung-heap,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecifed" anchored="true" >Perhaps a verse of Callimachus (Frag. anon. 374 ed. Schneider).</note> </l> </quote> in the same way busybodies, passing over topics and narratives which are in plain view and matters concerning which no one prevents their inquiring or is vexed if inquiry is made, pick out the hidden and obscure troubles of every household. And yet it was surely a clever answer that the Egyptian gave to the man who asked him what he was carrying wrapped up: <q>That’s why it <emph>is</emph> wrapped up.</q> And why, if you please, are <emph>you</emph> inquisitive about what is concealed? If it were not something bad, it would not be concealed. Yet it is not customary to walk into the house of someone else without at least first knocking on the door; but nowadays there are doormen and formerly there were knockers to be struck at the door and give warning, so that the stranger might not catch the mistress of the house or the unmarried daughter unawares, or a slave being punished or the maid-servants screaming. But it is for these very things that the busybody slips in. A sober and respectable household he would not willingly enter as a spectator even if he were invited to come; but the matters to conceal which keys and bolts and streetdoors are used-these are what he uncovers and communicates to outsiders. And yet <q>the winds with which we are most vexed,</q> as Ariston<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Von Arnim, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Stoic. Vet. Frag.</title>, i. pp. 89-90, Frag. 401.</note> says, <q>are those which pull up our garments,</q> but the busybody strips off not only the mantles and tunics of those near him, but also their very walls; he flings the doors wide open and makes his way, like <pb xml:id="v.6.p.483"/> a piercing wind, <q>through the maiden of tender skin,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hesiod, <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 519; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 465 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> and creeps in, searching out with slanderous intent drunken revels and dances and all-night festivals. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">And like Cleon in the comedy,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Aristophanes, <title rend="italic">Knights</title>, 79; <title rend="italic">Klopidai</title> (Thief-deme) is a play upon the actual deme <title rend="italic">Kropidai</title>.</note> <quote rend="blockquote">His hands in Beggar-town, his mind on Thefton,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Or better, Theevingen.</note> </quote> so the mind of the busybody is at the same time in mansions of the rich, in hovels of the poor, in royal courts, and in bridal chambers of the newly-wed. He searches out everybody’s business, that of strangers and that of rulers, nor is this search of his without danger; but just as though a man should taste aconite<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat"> Cf.<title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 49 e.</note> through curiosity about its properties, he would find that he had killed the taster before he had got his taste, so those who search out the vices of those more powerful than themselves destroy themselves before they acquire their knowledge. For instance those who scarcely glance<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Xenophon, <title rend="italic" >Memorabilia</title>, iv. 3. 14.</note> at these sunbeams which have been poured down so lavishly upon us all, but recklessly dare to gaze upon the orb itself and to rend its radiance apart, striving to force their way within, are blinded. This is the reason why Philippides,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 508 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra.</foreign> </note> the comic poet, made an excellent reply when King Lysimachus once said to him, <q>Which one of my possessions may I share with you?</q> <q>Anything, Sire,</q> said Philippides, <q>except your secrets.</q> For only the most pleasant and most decorous attributes of kings are displayed openly-their banquets and wealth and festivals and favours; but if there is anything <pb xml:id="v.6.p.485"/> secret, do not approach it, but let it be! The joy of a prosperous king is not concealed, nor is his laughter when he is amused, nor his outlay on entertainment and favours; but it is time for alarm when something is hidden, something dark, unsmiling, unapproachable, a storehouse of festering wrath, or the meditation of a punishment indicative of sullen anger, or jealousy of a wife, or some suspicion against a son, or distrust of a friend. Beware of this darkening and gathering cloud! That which is now hidden will be disclosed to you when the cloud bursts forth amid crashes of thunder and bolts of lightning! </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">What escape is there, then, from this vice? By a process of shifting and diverting our inquisitiveness, as has been said,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 515 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> and, if possible, by turning the soul to better and more pleasant subjects. Direct your curiosity to heavenly things and things on earth, in the air, in the sea. Are you by nature fond of small or of great spectacles? If of great ones, apply your curiosity to the sun: where does it set and whence does it rise? Inquire into the changes in the moon, as you would into those of a human being: what becomes of all the light she has spent and from what source did she regain it, how does it happen that <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When out of darkness first she comes anew, </l> <l>She shows her face increasing fair and full; </l> <l>And when she reaches once her brightest sheen, </l> <l>Again she wastes away and comes to naught?<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 315, Sophocles, Frag. 787 (871 ed. Pearson); the full quotation may be found in <title rend="italic">Life of Demetrius</title>, xlv. (911 c-d). <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also <title xml:lang="lat" rend="superscript">Moralia</title>, 282 b.</note> </l> </quote> And these are secrets of Nature, yet Nature is not vexed with those who find them out. Or suppose you have renounced great things. Then turn your <pb xml:id="v.6.p.487"/> curiosity to smaller ones: how are some plants always blooming and green and rejoicing in the display of their wealth at every season, while others are sometimes like these, but at other times, like a human spendthrift, they squander all at once their abundance and are left bare and beggared? Why, again, do some plants produce elongated fruits, others angular, and still others round and globular?</p>
<p rend="indent">But perhaps you will have no curiosity about these subjects since there is nothing evil in them. Yet if your zest for meddling must by all means be for ever feeding and dwelling on depraved things, like a maggot on dead matter, let us escort it to history and supply it with an unstinted abundance of evils. For there you will find <quote rend="blockquote">The deaths of men, the shufflings off of life,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Aeschylus, <title rend="italic">Suppliants</title>, 937; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 937 f.</note> </quote> seductions of women, assaults of slaves, slanders of friends, compounding of poisons, envies, jealousies, shipwrecks of households, overthrow of empires. Glut and enjoy yourself and cause no trouble or pain to any of your associates! </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">But curiosity apparently takes no pleasure in stale calamities, but wants them hot and fresh; it enjoys the spectacle of novel tragedies and has not much zest for association with the comic and more cheerful side of life. Consequently when anyone tells the tale of a wedding or a sacrifice or a complimentary escort, the busybody is a careless and inattentive listener, and declares that he has already heard most of the details and urges the narrator to <pb xml:id="v.6.p.489"/> cut them short or skip them. But if someone sitting near at hand narrates the seduction of a maiden or the adultery of a wife or the framing of a law-suit or a quarrel of brothers, the busybody neither dozes off to sleep nor pleads an engagement, <quote rend="blockquote">But asks more speech and proffers both his ears<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Callimachus, Frag. anon. 375 ed. Schneider.</note>;</quote> and that saying,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 913, ades. 386.</note> <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Alas! </l> <l>How much more readily than glad events </l> <l>Is mischance carried to the ears of men!</l> </quote> is spoken truly when applied to busy bodies. For as cupping-glasses<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 469 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 600 c.</note> draw from the flesh what is worst in it, so the ears of busy bodies attract the most evil stories. Or rather, as cities have certain unlucky and dismal gates through which they lead out condemned criminals and cast out the refuse<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat"> Cf.<title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 271 a.</note> and the scapegoats, while nothing undefiled or sacred either goes in or out through them, so also the ears of busy bodies give passage and thoroughfare to nothing good or decent, but only to gruesome tales, serving, as they do, as conveyance for foul and polluted narratives. <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The only song that’s heard within my house </l> <l>Is wailing cries.<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 463 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> </l> </quote> This is the one Muse and Siren for busybodies, this is the sweetest of all music to their ears.</p>
<p rend="indent">For curiosity is really a passion for finding out whatever is hidden and concealed, and no one conceals a good thing when he has it; why, people even pretend to have good things when they have them <pb xml:id="v.6.p.491"/> not. Since, then, it is the searching out of troubles that the busybody desires, he is possessed by the affliction called <q>malignancy,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A term better expressed by the German <foreign xml:lang="deu">Schadenfreude</foreign>.</note> brother to envy and spite. For envy is pain at another’s good, while malignancy is joy at another’s evil<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat"> Cf.<title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 1046 b.</note>; and both spring from a savage and bestial affliction, a vicious nature. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">So painful for all of us is the revelation of our own troubles that many die rather than reveal to physicians some hidden malady. Just imagine Herophilus<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Of Chalcedon, a great anatomist of the Alexandrian age (<title rend="italic">flor. circa</title> 300 b.c.).</note> or Erasistratus<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Of Ceos, worked in Alexandria at the height of his fame (258 b.c.).</note> or Asclepius himself, when he was a mortal man,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Asclepius, the son of Apollo, was deified after death as the god of medicine.</note> carrying about their drugs and instruments, calling at one house after another, and inquiring whether a man had an abscess in the anus or a woman a cancer in the womb! And yet the inquisitiveness of this profession is a salutary thing. Yet everyone, I imagine, would have driven such a man away, because he does not wait to be sent for, but comes unsummoned to investigate others’ infirmities. And busybodies search out these very matters and others still worse, not to cure, but merely to expose them. For this reason they are hated deservedly. For example, we are annoyed and displeased with customs-officials, not when they pick up those articles which we are importing openly, but when in the search for concealed goods they pry into baggage and merchandize which are another’s property. And yet the law allows them to do this and they would lose<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Since the collection of taxes and duties was farmed out to individuals, they would be the losers in failing to make a minute search for dutiable articles.</note> by not doing so. But busybodies ruin and abandon <pb xml:id="v.6.p.493"/> their own interests in their excessive occupation with those of others. Only rarely do they visit the farm, for they cannot endure the quiet and silence of being alone. But if, after a long absence, they do chance to put in there, they have more of an eye for their neighbours’ vines than for their own, and they ask how many of their neighbours’ cattle have died, or how much of his wine has turned sour. But they are soon sated with such news and run away. Yet the true and genuine farmer does not care to hear even news that makes its own way from the city; he says<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com. Att. Frag.</title>, iii. p. 473, ades. 347; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 511 e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, where it is the typical Athenian slave of whom his farmer-master complains.</note> <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Then he will tell me while he digs </l> <l>On what terms peace was made. The cursed scamp </l> <l>Now strolls around and meddles with these things.</l> </quote> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">And the busybody, shunning the country as something stale and uninteresting and undramatie, pushes into the bazaar and the market-place and the harbours: <q>Is there any news?</q> <q>Weren’t you at market early this morning? Well then, do you suppose the city has changed its constitution in three hours?</q> If, however, someone really does have something of that nature to tell him, he dismounts from his horse, grasps his informant’s hand, kisses him, and stands there listening. But if someone meets him and tells him that there is no news, he exclaims as though he were annoyed, <q>What do you mean? Haven’t you been at market? Didn’t you pass the War Office? Didn’t you interview the new arrivals from Italy either?</q> It is for this reason that the legislation of the Locrian magistrates was excellent. For if anyone who had been out of town came <pb xml:id="v.6.p.495"/> up and asked, <q>Is there any news?</q> they fined him. Just as cooks<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">The professional cook was also a butcher.</note> pray for a good crop of young animals and fishermen for a good haul of fish, in the same way busybodies pray for a good crop of calamities, a good haul of difficulties, for novelties, and changes, that they, like cooks and fishermen, may always have something to fish out or butcher.</p>
<p rend="indent">Another good law was that of the legislator of Thurii,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Charondas.</note> for he forbade the lampooning on the comic stage of all citizens except adulterers and busybodies. And indeed adultery does seem to be a sort of curiosity about another’s pleasure and a searching out and examination of matters which are closely guarded and escape general observation, while curiosity is an encroaching, a debauching and denuding of secret things. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">Since a natural consequence of much learning is to have much to say (and for this reason Pythagoras<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic">Life of Numa</title></foreign>, viii. (65 b); <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Vita et Poesi Homeri</title>, 149 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 420); Lucian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Vitarum Auctio</title>, 3.</note> enjoined upon the young a five years’ silence which he called a <q>Truce to Speech</q>), a necessary concomitant of inquisitiveness is to speak evil.<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 508 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> For what the curious delight to hear they delight to tell, and what they zealously collect from others they joyously reveal to everyone else. Consequently, in addition to its other evils, their disease actually impedes the fulfilment of their desires.<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 502 e-f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> For everyone is on his guard to hide things from them and is reluctant to do anything while a busybody is looking, or to say anything while one is listening, but defers consultation and postpones the consideration of business until such an inquisitive person is out of <pb xml:id="v.6.p.497"/> the way. And if, when either some secret matter is under discussion or some important business is being transacted, a busybody comes on the scene, men drop the matter from the discussion and conceal it, as one does a tidbit when a cat runs by. Consequently these persons are often the only ones to whom those matters are not told or shown which everyone else may hear and see.</p>
<p rend="indent">For the same reason the busybody is deprived of everybody’s confidence<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 503 c-d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note>: we should prefer, on any account, to entrust our letters and papers and seals to slaves and strangers rather than to inquisitive friends and relatives. That noble Bellerophon<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">. Il.</title>, vi. 168.</note> did not break the seal even on a letter accusing himself which he was carrying, but kept his hands from the king’s letter by reason of that same continence which kept him from the king’s wife. Inquisitiveness, in fact, is indicative of incontinence no less than is adultery, and in addition, it is indicative of terrible folly and fatuity. For to pass by so many women who are public property open to all and then to be drawn toward a woman who is kept under lock and key and is expensive, and often, if it so happens, quite ugly, is the very height of madness and insanity. And it is this same thing which busybodies do: they pass by much that is beautiful to see and to hear, many matters excellent for relaxation and amusement, and spend their time digging into other men’s trifling correspondence, gluing their ears to their neighbours’ walls, whispering with slaves and women of the streets, and often incurring danger, and always infamy. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">For this reason the most useful means possible for turning the busybody from his vice is for him to <pb xml:id="v.6.p.499"/> remember what he has previously learned.<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">With this chapter may be compared chapter 19 of <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Vitioso Pudore</title> (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 536 c-d).</note> For, as Simonides<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the same story, illustrating the avarice of Simonides, in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 555 f; there the box containing his fees is full of silver.</note> used to say that when he opened his boxes after some time, he always found the fee-box full, but the thanks-box empty, so if one opens from time to time the deposit-box of inquisitiveness and examines it, full as it is of many useless, futile, and unlovely things, perhaps this procedure would give sufficient offence, so completely disagreeable and silly would it appear.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">The greatest factor, however, in ridding ourselves of this affliction is the habit of beginning early to train and teach ourselves to acquire this self-control. It is, in fact, by habituation that the disease has come to increase, advancing, as it does, little by little. How this habit is acquired, we shall learn when we discuss the proper training. So first let us begin with the most trifling and unimportant matters. What difficulty is there about refraining from reading the inscriptions on tombs as we journey along the roads? Or what is there arduous in just glancing at the writing on walls when we take our walks? We have only to remind ourselves that <pb xml:id="v.6.p.503"/> nothing useful or pleasant has been written there: merely so-and-so <q>commemorates</q> so-and-so <q>wishing him well,</q> and someone else is the <q>best of friends,</q> and much twaddle of this sort.<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">I quote Shilleto’s note: <q>Plutarch rather reminds one, in his evident contempt for <title rend="italic">Epitaphs</title>, of the cynic who asked, <q>Where are all the bad people buried?</q> Where indeed?</q> </note> It may seem that no harm will come from reading these, but harm you it does by imperceptibly instilling the practice of searching out matters which do not concern you. And as hunters do not allow young hounds to turn aside and follow every scent, but pull them up and check them with the leash, keeping their sense of smell pure and untainted for their proper task in order that it may keep more keenly to the trail, <quote rend="blockquote" >With nostrils tracking down the paths of beasts<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">From an unknown poet: Empedocles?

For as eagles and lions<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat"> Cf.<title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 966 c. <q>Eagles</q> is probably corrupt. Pohlenz suggests <q>cats.</q> </note> draw in their claws when they walk so that they may not wear off the sharpness of the tips, so, if we consider that curiosity for learning has also a sharp and keen edge, let us not waste or blunt it upon matters of no value. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">In the second place, then, let us accustom ourselves not to look inside when we pass another’s door, nor with our curious gaze to clutch, as it were by main force, at what is happening within, but let us ever keep ready for use the saying of Xenocrates, <pb xml:id="v.6.p.505"/> that it makes no difference whether it is the feet or the eyes that we set within another’s house; for what the eyes behold is neither just nor honourable, and not even pleasant. <quote rend="blockquote">Unsightly, stranger, are the things within,<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Trag.

And this practice of throwing sidelong and furtive glances, distorting the soul as it does, is shameful, and the habit it implants is depraved. For instance, when Diogenes<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aelian, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Varia Historia</title>, xii. 58.</note> saw the Olympic victor Dioxippus making his triumphal entry in his chariot and unable to tear his eyes away from a beautiful woman who was among the spectators of the procession, but continually turning around and throwing side-glances in her direction, <q>Do you see,</q> said the Cynic, <q>how a slip of a girl gets a strangle-hold on our athlete?</q> And you may observe how every kind of spectacle alike gets a strangle-hold on busybodies and twists their necks round when they once acquire a habit and practice of scattering their glances in all directions.

But as it is, the words of Sophocles<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Electra</title>, 724-725.</note> come true: <pb xml:id="v.6.p.507"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Then the Aenianian’s hard-mouthed yearlings break </l> <l>From his control and bolt;</l> </quote> that is, the senses which have not received what we called above right instruction and training run away, dragging the intellect with them, and often plunge it into deep disaster. Consequently, though that story about Democritus<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. d. Vorsokratiker</title> <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>, ii. p. 89, A 27.</note> is false, that he deliberately destroyed his sight by fixing his eyes on a red-hot mirror and allowing its heat to be reflected on his sight, in order that his eyes might not repeatedly summon his intellect outside and disturb it, but might allow his mind to remain inside at home and occupy itself with pure thinking, blocking up as it were windows which open on the street; yet nothing is more true than this, that those who make most use of the intellect make fewest calls upon the senses.<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Plutarch is thinking of some such passage as Plato, <title rend="italic">Phaedo</title>, 66 a.</note> We observe, for instance, that men have built their sanctuaries of the Muses<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, halls devoted to learning, such as the Museion at Alexandria and the Academy at Athens.</note> far from cities and that they have called night <q>kindly</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aeschylus, <title rend="italic" >Agamemnon</title>, 265.</note> from a belief that its quiet and absence of distraction is greatly conducive to the investigation and solution of the problems in hand. </p> </div>

<p rend="indent">And after this it is well to make our training more intensive and pass by a theatre where a successful performance is in progress; and, when our friends urge us to see a certain dancer or comedian, to thrust them aside; and, when shouts are heard on the racecourse or in the circus, not to turn round. For as Socrates<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 513 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> used to advise the avoidance of such foods as tempt us to eat when we are not hungry and such drinks as tempt us to imbibe when we are not thirsty, so we also should avoid and guard against such sights and sounds as master and attract us without fulfilling any need of ours. Thus Cyrus<note resp="editor"  place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Xenophon, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Cyropaedia</title>, v. 1. 8; <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 31 c.</note> was unwilling to see Pantheia; and when Araspes declared that the woman’s beauty was worth seeing, Cyrus said, <q>Then this is all the more reason for keeping away from her.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p rend="indent">Since, therefore, for the attainment of justice you may sometimes forgo an honest gain that you may accustom yourself to keep clear of dishonest profit, so likewise, for the attainment of continence, you may sometimes keep aloof from your own wife in order that you may never be stirred by another’s. Then apply this habit to inquisitiveness and endeavour sometimes not to hear or see some of the things that concern you, and when someone wishes to tell you something that has happened in your house, put him off and refuse to hear words that are supposed to have been spoken about you. It was, in fact, curiosity which involved Oedipus in the greatest calamities. Believing that he was no Corinthian, but a foreigner, and seeking to discover his identity, he encountered Laïus; and when he had killed Laïus and had taken, in addition to the throne, his own mother to wife, though seeming to all to be blessed by fortune, he began again to try to discover his identity. And although his wife attempted to prevent him, all the more vigorously did he cross-examine the old man who knew the truth, bringing every form of compulsion to bear.
