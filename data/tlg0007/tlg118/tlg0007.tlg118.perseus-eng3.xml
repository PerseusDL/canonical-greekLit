					<head>PRECEPTS OF STATECRAFT (<foreign xml:lang="lat">PRAECEPTA GERENDAE REIPUBLICAE</foreign>)
						</head>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent">This essay is addressed to Menemachus, a young man who has asked Plutarch for advice concerning public life. Nothing further is known of the young man, except that Pardalas of Sardis is mentioned as his fellow-citizen (813 f; 825 d); but some of those to whom Plutarch’s various essays are addressed are known to be real persons, and it is, therefore, probable that Menemachus also actually existed. Plutarch held at different times various public offices, and moreover he was highly regarded by his fellowcitizens and many others as a guide, philosopher, and friend; it is, therefore, not unnatural that a young man who was thinldng of entering upon a political career should appeal to him for advice and counsel, though it is also possible that Plutarch wrote the essay without being asked to do so and addressed it to Menemachus merely as a matter of form. </p> 
     	<p rend="indent">There is nothing profoundly philosophical and very little purely theoretical to be found here. Greece, like most of the known world, was a part of the Roman Empire, and the exercise of statecraft on a large scale was virtually limited to Romans. The ancient Greek city-states retained, however, their local self-government, subject to the supervision of the proconsul; they could enter into agreements with each other, and could send envoys to Rome if <pb xml:id="v.10.p.157"/> occasion arose. A man could, therefore, find useful and honourable occupation in public life, as Plutarch himself did. Although he frequently uses the great men of the great days of Greece as examples, Plutarch gives the sort of advice which would be useful to one engaged insuch political activity as was open to a Greek in his time. Some of his advice is applicable only to his own times and its conditions, but the politician or statesman of any age may recognize many of his precepts as common sense, the application of which is limited to no time or place. The essay is, then, of interest, not only because it throws a sidelight upon the conditions in Greece in Plutarch’s time, but also on account of its own inherent value. </p> 
     	<p rend="indent">The reference to troubles which took place <q>recently under Domitian</q> (815 d, Chapter 19) may indicate that the essay was written not long after a.d. 96, the date of Domitian’s death. </p> </div>
<pb xml:id="v.10.p.159"/>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">If, Menemachus, it is suitable to apply to anything at all the saying <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>No one of all the Achaeans finds fault with the words thou hast uttered, </l> <l>Nor will oppose them in speech; and yet thou hast reached no conclusion,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> ix. 55; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 795 b.</note> </l> </quote> it may be applied to those philosophers who urge people to take lessons from them, but give no real instruction or advice; for they are like those who trim the lamps, but fail to pour in oil. Therefore, seeing that the desire has been aroused in you a <quote rend="blockquote">Speaker of speeches to be, and also a doer of actions<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic" >Il.</title> ix. 443; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. <title rend="italic">Moralia</title></foreign>, 795 e.</note> </quote> in your native State, as befits your noble birth, since you have not time to gain an understanding of a philosopher’s life in the open among affairs of State and public conflicts or to be a spectator of examples worked out in deed, not merely in word, and since you ask for some precepts of statecraft, I think it is not at all fitting that I should refuse, and I pray that the result may be worthy of your zeal and of my goodwill; and, as you requested, I have made use of a rather large variety of examples. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">First, then, at the base of political activity there <pb xml:id="v.10.p.161" /> must be, as a firm and strong foundation, a choice of policy arising from judgement and reason, not from mere impulse due to empty opinion or contentiousness or lack of other activities. For just as those who have no useful occupation at home spend most of their time in the market-place, even if there is nothing they need there, just so some men, because they have no business of their own that is worth serious attention, throw themselves into public affairs, treating political activity as a pastime, and many who have become engaged in public affairs by chance and have had enough of them are no longer able to retire from them without difficulty; they are in the same predicament as persons who have gone aboard a vessel to be rocked a bit and then have been driven out into the open sea; they turn their gaze outside, seasick and much disturbed, but obliged to stay where they are and endure their present plight. <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Over the bright calm sea </l> <l>The fair-faced loves went past them to the mad </l> <l>Outrage of the ship’s oars that plough the deep.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Poet. Lyr. Graec.</title> iii. p. 396, ascribed to Simonides.</note> </l> </quote> These men cast the greatest discredit upon public life by regretting their course and being unhappy when, after hoping for glory, they have fallen into disgrace or, after expecting to be feared by others on account of their power, they are drawn into affairs which involve dangers and popular disorders. But the man who has entered upon public life from conviction and reasoning, as the activity most befitting him and most honourable, is not frightened by any of these things, nor is his conviction changed. For neither is it right to enter upon public life as a gainful trade, as <pb xml:id="v.10.p.163"/> Stratocles and Dromocleides and their set used to invite each other to come to the golden harvest (for so they called the orators’ platform in jest); nor ought we to enter upon it as if wTe were suddenly seized by an onset of strong emotion, as Gaius Gracchus did, who, when his brother’s misfortunes were still fresh, withdrew so far as possible from public affairs and then, inflamed by anger because certain persons insulted and reviled him, rushed into public life. And although he was quickly satiated with public affairs and fame, yet when he tried to stop and wished for a change and a quiet life, he found that his power was too great to be laid down but before he could lay it down he perished. And those who make themselves up for political competition or the race for glory, as actors do for the stage, must necessarily regret their action, since they must either serve those whom they think they should rule or offend those whom they wish to please. On the contrary, I believe that those who, like men who fall into a well, stumble into public life by mere chance and unexpectedly must be cast into confusion and regret their course, whereas those who enter into it quietly, as the result of preparation and reflection, will be moderate in their conduct of affairs and will not be discomposed by anything, inasmuch as they have honour itself and nothing else as the purpose of their actions. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">So, after thus determining their choice in their own minds and making it invariable and unchangeable, statesmen must apply themselves to the understanding of the character of the citizens, which shows itself as in the highest degree a compound of all their individual characters and is powerful. For any attempt <pb xml:id="v.10.p.165"/> on the part of the statesman to produce by himself at the very outset a change of character and nature in the people will not easily succeed, nor is it safe, but it is a matter that requires a long space of time and great power. But just as wine is at first controlled by the character of the drinker but gradually, as it warms his whole body and becomes mingled therewith, itself forms the drinker’s character and changes him, just so the statesman, until he has by his reputation and by public confidence in him built up his leadership, must accommodate himself to the people’s character as he finds it and make that the object of his efforts, knowing by what things the people is naturally pleased and led. For example, the Athenian populace is easily moved to anger, easily turned to pity, more willing to suspect quickly than to be informed at leisure; as they are readier to help humble persons of no reputation, so they welcome and especially esteem facetious and amusing speeches; while they take most delight in those who praise them, they are least inclined to be angry with those who make fun of them; they are terrible even to their chief magistrates, then kindly even to their enemies. Quite different is the character of the Carthaginian people; it is bitter, sullen, subservient to their magistrates, harsh to their subjects, most abject when afraid, most savage when enraged, stubborn in adhering to its decisions, disagreeable and hard in its attitude towards playfulness and urbanity. Never would these people, if a Cleon had asked them to postpone the meeting of the assembly on the ground that he had made sacrifice and had guests to entertain,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The story of the adjournment of the assembly is told by Plutarch in the <title rend="italic">Life of Nicias</title>, chap. vii. p. 527.</note> have adjourned the meeting amid laughter and the clapping of hands; nor would they, when a quail escaped from Alcibiades’ <pb xml:id="v.10.p.167"/> cloak while he was speaking, have joined eagerly in hunting it down and then have given it back to him<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See <title rend="italic">Life of Alcibiades</title>, chap. x. p. 195.</note>; no, they would have put them both to death for their insolence and their flippancy, seeing that they banished Hanno on the charge of aspiring to be tyrant, because he used a lion on his campaigns to carry his luggage! And I do not believe that the Thebans either, if they had obtained control of their enemies’ letters, would have refrained from reading them, as the Athenians, when they captured Philip’s mail-carriers with a letter addressed to Olympias, refrained from breaking the seal and making known an affectionate private message of an absent husband to his wife. Nor, on the other hand, do I believe that the Athenians would have borne with good temper the contemptuous pride of Epameinondas, when he refused to reply to the accusation against him but rose from his seat and went out from the theatre through the assembly to the gymnasium. And I think, too, that the Spartans would have been far from enduring the insolence and buffoonery of Stratocles, who persuaded the Athenians to make sacrifices on the ground that they had won a victory, and then, after a true report of their defeat had been received, when they were angry with him, asked the people what wrong he had done them seeing that, thanks to him, they had been happy for three days.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">. Life of Demetrius</title>, chap. xi.</note> Now court flatterers, like bird-catchers, by imitating the voices of kings and assimilating themselves to them, insinuate themselves deeply into their good graces and decoy them by deceit; but for the statesman it is fitting, not to imitate the character of his people, but to understand it and to employ for each type those means by <pb xml:id="v.10.p.169"/> which it can be brought under his control. For ignorance of their characters leads to no less serious mistakes and failures in free States than in the friendships of kings. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">So, then, the statesman who already has attained to power and has won the people’s confidence should try to train the character of the citizens, leading them gently towards that which is better and treating them with mildness; for it is a difficult task to change the multitude. But do you yourself, since you are henceforth to live as on an open stage, educate your character and put it in order; and if it is not easy wholly to banish evil from the soul, at any rate remove and repress those faults which are most flourishing and conspicuous. For you know the story that Themistocles, when he was thinking of entering upon public life, withdrew from drinking-parties and carousals; he was wakeful at night, was sober and deeply thoughtful, explaining to his friends that Miltiades’ trophy<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Militiades was the victorious general at Marathon, 490 b.c.</note> would not let him sleep. And Pericles also changed his personal habits of life, so that he walked slowly, spoke gently, always showed a composed countenance, kept his hand under his cloak, and trod only one path - that which led to the assembly and the senate. For a populace is not a simple and easy thing for any chance person to subject to that control which is salutary; but one must be satisfied if the multitude accept authority without shying, like a suspicious and capricious beast, at face or voice. Since, then, the statesman must not treat even these matters carelessly, ought he to neglect the things which affect his life and character, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.171"/> that they may be clear of blame and ill report of every kind? For not only are men in public life held responsible for their public words and actions, but people busy themselves with all their concerns: dinner, love affair, marriage, amusement, and every serious interest. What need is there, for instance, to speak of Alcibiades, who, though he was most active of all the citizens in public affairs and was undefeated as general, was ruined by his audacious and dissolute habits in private life, and, because of his extravagance and lack of restraint, deprived the State of the benefit of his other good qualities? Why, the Athenians blamed Cimon for wine-drinking, and the Romans, having nothing else to say, blamed Scipio<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 972 f.</note> for sleeping; and the enemies of Pompey the Great, observing that he scratched his head with one finger, reviled him for it.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 89 e, with note <emph>a</emph> in Babbitt’s translation (L.C.L.), where the habit is spoken of as a mark of effeminacy and licentiousness.</note> For, just as a mole or a wart on the face is more unpleasant than brandmarks, mutilations, or scars on other parts of the body, so small faults appear great when observed in the lives of leaders and statesmen on account of the opinion which the majority has of governing and public office, regarding it as a great thing which ought to be clean of all eccentricities and errors. With good reason, therefore, did Livius Drusus the tribune gain inreputation because, when many parts of his house were exposed to the view of his neighbours and an artisan promised to turn them the other way and change their position for only five talents, Drusus replied, <q>Take ten and make the whole house open to view, that all the citizens may see how I live.</q> For he was a man of temperate and <pb xml:id="v.10.p.173"/> well-ordered life. And perhaps he had no need of that exposure to the public view; for the people see through the characters, counsels, acts, and lives of public men, even those that seem to be very thickly cloaked; they love and admire one man and dislike and despise another quite as much for his private as for his public practices.</p>
<p rend="indent"> <q>But,</q> you say, <q>do not States put in office men who live licentiously and wantonly?</q> They do, and pregnant women often long for stones, and seasick persons for salt pickles and the like, which then a little later they spew out and detest. So the people of democracies, because of the luxury of their own lives or through sheer perversity, or for lack of better leaders, make use of those who happen to turn up, though they loathe and despise them, then take pleasure in hearing such things said about them as the comic poet Plato puts into the mouth of the People itself: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Take, take my hand as quickly as you can; </l> <l>I’m going to choose Agyrrhius general<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com. Att. Frag.</title> i. p. 652, no. 185; on Agyrrhius <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Aristophanes, <title rend="italic">Plutus</title>, 176.</note>;</l> </quote> and again, when he makes the People ask for a basin and a feather in order to vomit and then say, <quote rend="blockquote">Beside my platform Mantias takes his stand,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">From the same play as the preceding.</note> </quote> and <quote rend="blockquote">It feeds foul Cephalus, most hateful pest.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">From the same play as the preceding.</note> </quote> And the Roman people, when Carbo promised something and confirmed his promise with an oath and a curse, unanimously took a counter-oath that it did not trust him. And at Lacedaemon, when a <pb xml:id="v.10.p.175"/> dissolute man named Demosthenes made a desirable motion, the people rejected it, but the ephors chose by lot one of the elders and told him to make that same motion, in order that it might be made acceptable to the people, thus pouring, as it were, from a dirty vessel into a clean one. So great is the importance, in a free State, of confidence or lack of confidence in a man’s character. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">However, we should not on this account neglect the charm and power of eloquence and ascribe everything to virtue, but, considering oratory to be, not the creator of persuasion but certainly its coworker, we should correct Menander’s line, <quote rend="blockquote">The speaker’s nature, not his speech, persuades,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com. Att. Frag.</title> iii. p. 135, no. 472.</note> </quote> for both his nature and his speech do so; unless, indeed, one is to affirm that just as the helmsman, not the tiller, steers the ship, and the rider, not the rein, turns the horse, so political virtue, employing, not speech, but the speaker’s character as tiller or rein, sways a State, laying hold of it and directing it, as it were, from the stern, which is, in fact, as Plato says,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Critias</title>, 109 c <q>only it was not our bodies that they [the gods] constrained by bodily force, like shepherds guiding ther flocks by stroke of staff, but they directed from the stern, where the living creature is easiest to turn about (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾗ μάλιστα εὔστροφον ζῷον</foreign>), laying hold on the soul by persuasion, as by a rudder, according to their own disposition</q> (trans. R. G. Bury in L.C.L.).</note> the easiest way of turning an animal about. For those great and, as Homer calls them, <q>Zeus-descended</q> kings pad themselves out with purple robes and sceptres and guards and divine oracles, and although they enslaved the multitude by their grandeur, as if they were superior beings, they <pb xml:id="v.10.p.177"/> wished nevertheless to be <q>speakers of words</q> and they did not neglect the charm of speech, <quote rend="blockquote">Nor the assemblies in which men make themselves greatly distinguished,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic" >Il.</title> ix. 441.</note> </quote> and they worshipped not only Zeus of the Council, Ares Enyalius, and Athena of War, but they invoked also Calliopê, <quote rend="blockquote" >who accompanies reverend monarchs,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hesiod, <title rend="italic">Theog.</title> 80.</note> </quote> softening by persuasion and overcoming by charms the fierce and violent spirit of the people. How, then, is it possible that a private person of ordinary costume and mien who wishes to lead a State may gain power and rule the multitude unless he possesses persuasion and attractive speech? Now the pilots of ships employ others to give orders to the rowers, but the statesman needs to have in himself the mind that steers and also in himself the speech that gives orders, that he may not require some other man’s voice and be obliged to say, as Iphicrates did when defeated through the eloquence of Aristophon’s orators, <q>My opponents’ actor is better, but superior my play,</q> and may not often need those lines of Euripides, <quote rend="blockquote">Oh that the seed of wretched men were mute,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 678, no. 987.</note> </quote> and <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Ah, would that deeds of men possessed a voice, </l> <l>That clever speakers might become as naught<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag.

Frag.</title> p. 494, no. 439, from the first <title rend="italic" >Hippolytus</title>.</note>;</l> </quote> <pb xml:id="v.10.p.179"/> for these sayings ought perhaps to be granted as a refuge to Alcamenes, Nesiotes, Ictinus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Alcamenes and Nesiotes were sculptors of the fifth century b.c. Ictinus was architect of the Parthenon.</note> and all artisans and craftsmen if they take an oath that they are no speakers; as once at Athens, when two architects were being questioned with a view to a public work, one of them, a wheedling and elegant speaker, moved the people by declaiming a prepared speech about the construction of it, but the other, who was a better architect but lacked the power of speech, came forward and said: <q>Men of Athens, what he has said, I will do.</q> For, as Sophocles says,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 309, no. 760, perhaps from the satyr drama <title rend="italic" >Pandora</title>.</note> only those are servants of the goddess of artistry who <q>on the anvil with a heavy hammer</q> and with blows work the yielding and inanimate material of their art. But the spokesman for Athena of the City and Themis of Counsel, <quote rend="blockquote">She who dismisses assemblies of men and who also convenes them,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title> ii. 69.</note> </quote> employing speech as his only instrument, moulding and adapting some things and softening and smoothing off those which are hindrances to his work, such as would be knots in wood or flaws in iron,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic" >Sophist</title>, 267 e.</note> is an ornament to the city. For this reason the government in Pericles’ time was <q>in name,</q> as Thucydides says,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Thucydides, ii. 65. 8.</note> <q>a democracy, but in fact the rule of the foremost man,</q> because of his power of speech. For Cimon also was a good man, as were Ephialtes and Thucydides, but when the last named was asked by Archidamus King of the Spartans whether he <pb xml:id="v.10.p.181"/> or Pericles was the better wrestler, he replied, <q>Nobody can tell; for whenever I throw him in wrestling, he says he was not thrown and wins by persuading the onlookers.</q> And this brought not only reputation to Pericles but safety to the State; for while it was swayed by him it preserved its existing prosperity and refrained from foreign entanglements. But Nicias, whose policy was the same, but who lacked such power of persuasion and tried to rein in the people with speech as easy as a snaffle, could not restrain or master it, but against his will went off to Sicily on its back and together with it came a cropper. The wolf, they say, cannot be held by the ears; but one must lead a people or a State chiefly by the ears, not, as some do who have no practice in speaking and seek uncultured and inartistic holds upon the people, pulling them by the belly by means of banquets or gifts of money or arranging ballet-dances or gladiatorial shows, by which they lead the common people or rather curry favour with them, tor leadership of a people is leadership of those who are persuaded by speech; but enticing the mob by such means as have just been mentioned is exactly like catching and herding irrational beasts. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">The speech of the statesman, however, must not be juvenile and theatrical, as if he were making a speech for show and weaving a garland of delicate and flowery words; on the other hand it must not, as Pytheas said of the speech of Demosthenes, smell of the lamp and elaborate literary labour, with sharp arguments and with periods precisely measured by rule and compass. No, just as musicians demand that the touch upon the strings exhibit feeling, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.183"/> not mere technique, so the speech of the statesman, counsellor, and ruler must not exhibit shrewdness or subtlety, and it must not be to his credit to speak fluently or artistically or distributively,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">These seem to be somewhat technical words employed by the rhetoricians.</note> but his speech must be full of unaffected character, true high-mindedness, a father’s frankness, foresight, and thoughtful concern for others. His speech must also have, in a good cause, a charm that pleases and a winning persuasiveness; in addition to nobility of purpose it must possess grace arising from stately diction and appropriate and persuasive thoughts. And political oratory, much more than that used in a court of law, admits maxims, historical and mythical tales, and metaphors, by means of which those who employ them sparingly and at the proper moment move their audiences exceedingly; as did he who said <q>Do not make Hellas one-eyed,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Aristotle, <title rend="italic" >Rhetoric</title>, iii. 1017, p. 1411 a; said by the Athenian orator Leptines, in opposing the destruction of Sparta, one of the <q>eyes of Greece.</q> </note> and Demades when he said he was <q>governing the wreck of the State,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">.

     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">It is true, however, that derision and ridicule are sometimes proper parts of the statesman’s speech if employed, not as insults or buffoonery, but for needful reproof and disparagement. That sort of thing is most laudable in rejoinders and replies; for when employed of set purpose and without provocation, it makes the speaker appear to be a clown and carries with it a suspicion of malice, such as was attached to the ridicule in the speeches of Cicero, Cato the Elder, and Aristotle’s pupil Euxitheüs, all of whom frequently employed ridicule without previous provocation. But for one who employs it in self-defence the occasion makes it pardonable and at the same time pleasing, as when Demosthenes, in reply to a man who was suspected of being a thief and who mocked him for writing at night, said, <q>I am aware that I offend you by keeping a light burning,</q> and to Demades who shouted, <q>Demosthenes would correct <emph>me</emph> - <q>the sow correcting Athena,</q></q> he replied, <q>Yes, your Athena was caught in adultery last year!</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">These two retorts are recorded by Plutarch, <title rend="italic">Life of Demosthenes</title>, chap. xi. p. 851.

But in Phocion conciseness of speech was admired. At any rate Polyeuctus declared that Demosthenes was the greatest orator, but Phocion the cleverest in speaking, because his speech contained the most meaning in the fewest words. And Demosthenes, though he despised the other orators, used to say when Phocion rose to speak, <q>The cleaver of my speeches is getting up.</q> </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">Most of all, then, try to employ in addressing the people well-considered, not empty, speech, and to use precaution, knowing that even the great Pericles used to pray before making a public speech that no single utterance foreign to the matter in hand might occur to him. But nevertheless the orator must always keep his speech nimble and in good practice for making apt rejoinders; for occasions arise quickly and often bring with them in public affairs sudden developments. That is why Demosthenes was inferior to many, as they say, because he drew back and hesitated when the occasion called for the opposite course. And Theophrastus tells us that Alcibiades,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">. Life of Alcibiades</title>, chap. x.</note> because he planned, not only to say <pb xml:id="v.10.p.189"/> the right thing, but to say it in the right way, often while actually speaking would search for words and arrange them into sentences, thereby causing hesitation and failure. But the man who is so moved by the events which take place and the opportunities which offer themselves that he springs to his feet is the one who most thrills the crowd, attracts it, and carries it with him. So it was, for example, with Leo<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The name Leo, <q>lion,</q> made the little man seem ridiculous.</note> of Byzantium; he once came to address the Athenians when they were in political discord, and when they laughed at him because he was a little man, he said, <q>What if you should see my wife, who hardly comes up to my knee?</q> Then when they laughed louder, <q>And yet,</q> he said, <q>little as we are, when we quarrel with each other, the city of Byzantium is not big enough to hold us.</q> So also when Pytheas the orator was speaking in opposition to the granting of honours to Alexander and someone said to him, <q>Do you, at your age, dare to speak on such important matters?</q> he replied: <q>And yet Alexander is younger than I, and you are voting to make him a god.</q> </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">And the statesman must bring to the struggle of statecraft - a struggle which is not unimportant, but calls for all one’s fighting power - speech which is severely trained in firmness of voice and strength of lungs, that he may not be frequently so weary and burnt out as to be defeated by some <quote rend="blockquote">Rapacious bawler with a torrent’s voice.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Aristophanes, <title rend="italic">Knights</title>, 137.

     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">There are two entrances to public life and two paths leading to it: one the quick and brilliant road to reputation, by no means without risk, the other more prosaic and slower, but safer. For some men launch out at once into political life with some conspicuous, great, and daring action, like men who launch a vessel from a promontory that juts out into the sea; they think Pindar is right in saying <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>To a work’s beginning we needs must set </l> <l>A front that shines afar,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> vi. 4.

For, as Ariston says, fire does not cause smoke, nor reputation envy, if it blazes up quickly at the start, but those who grow great gradually and slowly are attacked one from one side, another from another; hence many men before coming to full bloom as public speakers have withered away. But if, as is said of Ladas, <quote rend="blockquote">The noise o’ the barrier’s fall was in his ears<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Paton’s translation (in L.C.L.) of the phrase in <title rend="italic">Anth.

In this way Aratus arrived at fame, beginning his public life with the destruction of the tyrant Nicocles; so Alcibiades, by making the Mantinean alliance against the Lacedaemonians. Pompey demanded a triumph although he had not yet been admitted to the senate, and when Sulla voted against it, he said, <q>More worship the rising than the setting sun</q>; and Sulla, when he heard this, withdrew his opposition. And take the case of Cornelius Scipio; it was not because of any chance beginning that the Roman people suddenly and contrary to law appointed him consul when he wTas a candidate for the aedileship, but rather because they admired his victorious single combat in Iberia when he was a mere youth, and his deeds a little later at Carthage as military tribune, about which Cato the Elder exclaimed <quote rend="blockquote">He and he only has sense, the rest are mere flickering shadows.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title> xi. 495 (slightly changed).</note> </quote> Nowadays, then, when the affairs of the cities no longer include leadership in wars, nor the overthrowing of tyrannies, nor acts of alliances, what opening for a conspicuous and brilliant public career could a young man find? There remain the public lawsuits and embassies to the Emperor, which demand a man of ardent temperament and one who possesses both courage and intellect. But there are many excellent lines of endeavour that are neglected <pb xml:id="v.10.p.195"/> in our cities which a man may take up, and also many practices resulting from evil custom, that have insinuated themselves to the shame or injury of the city, which a man may remove, and thus turn them to account for himself. Indeed in past times a just verdict gained in a great suit, or good faith in acting as advocate for a weak client against a powerful opponent, or boldness of speech in behalf of the right against a wicked ruler, has opened to some men a glorious entrance into public life. And not a few also have grown great through the enemies they have made by attacking men whose position made them enviable or caused them to be feared; for when such a man is overthrown his power passes at once, and with better reputation, to the man who overcame him. For attacking, through motives of envy, a good man who, on account of his virtue, is leader of the state, as Pericles was attacked by Simmias, Themistocles by Alcmeon, Pompey by Clodius, and Epameinondas by Menecleides the orator, is neither conducive to a good reputation nor advantageous in any other way; for when the people have committed a wrong against a good man and then (which happens quickly) repent of their anger, they think the easiest way to excuse themselves for this offence is the most just, namely, to destroy the man who was the author of it and persuaded them to commit it. On the other hand, to revolt against a bad man who by shameless audacity and cunning has made the city subject to himself, such as Cleon and Cleophon were at Athens, and to pull him down and humble him provides a glorious entrance upon the stage of public life. And I am not ignorant of the fact that some men by curtailing the power of an oppressive and <pb xml:id="v.10.p.197"/> oligarchical senate, as Ephialtes did at Athens and Phormio at Elis, have gained at the same time both power and glory; but to one who is just entering upon public life there is a great risk in this. Therefore Solon made a better beginning, when the State was divided into three factions called the Diacrians (<q>hillfolk</q>), the Pedieans (<q>plainsfolk</q>), and the Paralians (<q>coastfolk</q>); for he entangled himself with none of them, but acted for all in common and said and did everything to bring about concord among them, so that he was chosen lawgiver to reconcile their differences and in this way established his rule.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Aristotle, <title rend="italic" >Constitution of Athens</title>, chap. v.</note> So many, then, and of such kinds are the more conspicuous ways of entering upon a public career. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">But the safe and leisurely way has been chosen by many famous men - Aristeides, Phocion, Pammenes the Theban, Lucullus at Rome, Cato, the Lacedaemonian Agesilaüs. For just as ivy rises by twining itself about a strong tree, so each of these men, by attaching himself while still young to an older man and while still obscure to a man of reputation, being gradually raised up under the shelter of his power and growing great with him, fixed himself firmly and rooted himself in the affairs of State. For Aristeides was made great by Cleisthenes, Phocion by Chabrias, Lucullus by Sulla, Cato by Maximus, Epameinondas aided Pammenes, and Lysander Agesilaüs. But Agesilaüs through untimely ambition and jealousy of Lysander’s reputation insulted and quickly cast aside the guide of his actions; but the others in noble and statesmanlike fashion cherished their teachers until <pb xml:id="v.10.p.199"/> the end and joined in honouring them, enhancing in turn with their own radiance, and illuminating, like the heavenly bodies that face the sun, that which caused themselves to shine. Certainly Scipio’s detractors said that he was the actor, but his friend Laelius the real author of his deeds; Laelius, however, was not puffed up by any of those sayings but continued always eagerly to exalt Scipio’s virtue and renown. And Pompey’s friend Afranius, even though he was of humble station, nevertheless expected to be elected consul, but when Pompey favoured other candidates, he relinquished his ambition, saying that gaining the consulship would be to him not so much glorious as painful and troublesome, if it were against Pompey’s will and without his co-operation; and so after waiting only one year he both gained the office and retained the friendship.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">. Life of Pompey</title>, chap. xliv., where another story concerning the friendship of Pompey for Afranius is told.</note> Those who are thus led to renown by the hand of others gain favour with many, and at the same time, if anything unpleasant happens, are less disliked; and that is why Philip advised Alexander to gain friends as long as he could while another man was king by having pleasant intercourse with others and maintaining friendly relations with them. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">But anyone who is entering upon a public career should choose as his leader a man who is not merely of established reputation and powerful, but one who is all this on account of real worth. For just as not every tree will accept and support the grape-vine which entwines itself about it, but some trees stifle and ruin its growth, so in States, the men who are not lovers of what is noble, but merely lovers of honours and of office, do not afford young men opportunities for public activities, but through <pb xml:id="v.10.p.201" /> envy repress them and, to speak figuratively, wither them up by depriving them of glory, their natural nourishment. So Marius, after having achieved many successes in Libya and again in Gaul with the help of Sulla, ceased to employ him and cast him off, being angered by his growth in power, but using the incident of the seal as a pretext. For Sulla, when Marius was general and he was quaestor<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Equivalent here to adjutant.</note> in Libya, was sent by Marius to Bocchus and took Jugurtha prisoner; and being a young man who had just had his first taste of glory, he did not bear his good fortune with moderation, but had a seal engraved with a representation of his deed - Jugurtha surrendering to him - and wore it.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">. Life of Marius</title>, chap. x., and <title rend="italic">Life of Sulla</title>, chap. iii.</note> Marius threw this up against him and cast him off. And Sulla, transferring his allegiance to Catulus and Metellus, worthy men and opposed to Marius, quickly drove Marius out and broke his power in the civil war after he had almost overthrown Rome. Sulla, however, exalted Pompey from the time of his youth, rising up and uncovering his head when he came near; and also by giving the other young men opportunities for acts of leadership and even by urging some on against their will, he filled his armies with ambition and eagerness; and he gained power over them all by wishing to be, not the only great man, but first and greatest among many great ones. Such, then, are the men to whom young statesmen should attach themselves and cling closely, not snatching glory away from them, like Aesop’s wren who was carried up on the eagle’s shoulders, then suddenly flew out and got ahead of him, but <pb xml:id="v.10.p.203"/> receiving it from them in goodwill and friendship, knowing that no one can ever command well who has not first learned rightly to obey, as Plato says.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, 762 e.</note> </p> </div>

But he would have done better if he had cast out from his soul avarice and love of strife and had cleansed himself of envy and malice; for the State needs, not men who have no friends or comrades, but good and self-controlled men.

Such a statesman will be found to be no better than a builder or a carpenter who through ignorance and error makes use of such squares and rulers and levels as are sure to make his work crooked. For friends are the living and thinking tools of the statesman, and he ought not to slip with them when they go wrong, but he must be on the watch that <pb xml:id="v.10.p.207"/> they do not err even through ignorance. In fact, it was this that disgraced Solon and brought him into disrepute among the citizens; for when he made up his mind to lighten debts and to introduce the Seisachtheia<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The cancellation of debts was one of the chief features of Solon’s reorganization of the government of Athens in the sixth century b.c.

Agesilaüs, too, showed himself very weak and poor-spirited in dealing with his friends’ solicitations and, like Pegasus in Euripides’ drama, <quote rend="blockquote">Crouched down and yielded more if more he wished,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic">Bellerophon</title>, Frag. 309, p. 451 Nauck.

Life of Timoleon</title>, chaps. iv., v., pp. 237, 238.</note> when he was unable either by instruction or by entreaty to make his brother give up his tyranny, joined with those who destroyed him. For a statesman ought, by stopping short of being a party to perjury, not to be a <q>friend as far as the altar,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A proverbial expression (Latin <foreign xml:lang="lat">usque ad aras</foreign>) equivalent to our <q>to the bitter end</q>; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. <title rend="italic">Moralia</title></foreign>, 531 d.</note> as Pericles once said, but only so far as conforms to any law, equity, or advantage the neglect of which leads to great public injury, as did the failure to punish Sphodrias and Phoebidas, for they did a great deal to make Sparta enter into the Leuctrian war. For the principles that govern a statesman’s conduct do not force him to act with severity against the moderate errors of his friends; on the contrary, they make it possible for him, after he has once made the chief public interests safe, out of his abundant resources to assist his friends, take his stand beside them, and help them out of their troubles. And there are also favours which arouse no ill-will, such as aiding a friend to gain an office, putting into his hands some honourable administrative function or some friendly foreign mission, for example one which includes honours to a ruler or negotiations with a State concerning friendship and concord; and if some public activity be laborious, but conspicuous and important, the statesman can first appoint himself to the post and then choose his friend as assistant, just as Diomedes did: <pb xml:id="v.10.p.211"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>So if you tell me myself to choose another as comrade, </l> <l>How in that case could I e’er be forgetful of godlike Odysseus?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> x. 242.</note> </l> </quote> And Odysseus again fittingly returns the compliment: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Now these horses, old sir, these new ones, of which thou inquirest, </l> <l>Thracian they are, but their master was slain by the brave Diomedes, </l> <l>Slain and beside him his comrades, twelve comrades and all of the noblest.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> x. 558.</note> </l> </quote> For such concession to one’s friends adorns those who give praise no less than those who receive it; but self-conceit, says Plato,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Letters</title>, iv. 321 b.</note> dwells with loneliness. Then, besides, a man ought to ascribe to his friends a share in his own good and kindly acts of favour; he should tell those who have been benefited to praise and show them affection as the originators and advisers of the favours. But base and absurd requests he should reject, not harshly but gently, informing the askers by way of consolation that the requests are not in accord with their own excellence and reputation. Epameinondas exemplifies this most admirably: after refusing to let the pedlar out of prison at Pelopidas’s request and then letting him out a little later when his mistress asked it, he said, <q>Favours of that sort, Pelopidas, are fit for courtesans to receive, but not for generals.</q> But Cato acted harshly and arbitrarily when he was quaestor, and Catulus the censor, one of his most intimate friends, asked for the acquittal of a man who was being tried, by saying: <q>It is a disgrace that you, whose duty it is to train us young men to honourable conduct, have to be thrown out by our servants.</q> For he might, while refusing the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.213"/> favour in fact, have avoided harshness and bitterness of speech, by producing the impression that the offensive quality of his action was not due to his own will, but was forced upon him by law and justice. There ai’e also in public life ways which are not dishonourable of helping friends who need money to acquire it; as, for example, when after the battle Themistocles saw a corpse wearing a golden bracelet and necklace, he himself passed it by, but turned to his friend and said, <q>Take these things, for you are not, as I am, Themistocles.</q> For the administration of affairs frequently gives the man in public life this sort of chance to help his friends; for not every man is a Menemachus.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The friend to whom this essay is addressed.</note> Hand over to one friend a case at law which will bring in a good fee as advocate in a just cause, to another introduce a rich man who needs legal oversight and protection, and help another to get some profitable contract or lease. Epameinondas even told a friend to go to a certain rich man and ask for a talent, saying that it was he who bade him give it; and when the man who had been asked for it came and asked him the reason, he replied: <q>Because this man is a good man and poor, but you are rich since you have appropriated much of the State’s wealth.</q> And Xenophon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic" >Ages.</title> 4.</note> says that Agesilaiis delighted in enriching his friends, he being himself above money. </p> </div>

And some people also are immensely pleased by the conduct of Cretinas of Magnesia. He was a political opponent of Hermeias, a man who was not powerful but was of ambitious spirit and brilliant mind, and when the Mithridatic war broke out, seeing that the State was in danger, he told Hermeias to take over the command and manage affairs, while he himself withdrew; or, if Hermeias wished him to be general, then Hermeias should remove himself, that they might not by ambitious strife with one another destroy the State. The challenge pleased Hermeias, and saying that Cretinas was more versed in war than himself, he went away with his wife and children. And as he was departing Cretinas escorted him, first giving him out of his own means such things as were more useful to exiles than to people besieged in a city, after which by his excellent military leadership he saved the State unexpectedly when it was on the brink of destruction.

For to be unwilling to make peace with a personal enemy for the sake of those things for which we ought even to give up a friend is shockingly uncivilized and as low as the beasts. Certamly Phoeion and Cato and their like acted much better, for they would allow no personal enmity to have any bearing whatsoever upon political <pb xml:id="v.10.p.217" /> differences, but were stern and inexorable only in public contests against sacrificing what was for the common good; yet in private matters they treated kindly and without anger their political opponents. For the statesman should not regard any fellow-citizen as an enemy, unless some man, such as Aristion, Nabis, or Catiline, should appear who is a pest and a running sore to the State. Those who are in other ways out of harmony he should, like a skilful musician, bring into unison by gently tightening or relaxing the strings of his control, not attacking angrily and insultingly those who err, but making an appeal designed rather to make a moral impression, as Homer does: <quote rend="blockquote">Truly, my friend, I did think you surpassed other men in your wisdom<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic" >Il.</title>, xvii. 171.</note>;</quote> and <quote rend="blockquote">Knowledge thou hast to devise other speech that is better than this was.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> vii. 358.</note> </quote> But if they say or do anything good, he should not be vexed by their honours, nor should he be sparing of complimentary words for their good actions; for if we act in this way our blame, where it is needed, will be thought justified, and we shall make them dislike evil by exalting virtue and showing through comparison that good actions are more worthy and fitting than the other kind. And I think also that the statesman should give testimony in just causes even for his opponents, should aid them in court against the malicious prosecutors, and should discredit calumnies about them if such accusations are alien to the principles they profess; just as the infamous Nero, a little before he put Thrasea to death, whom he hated and feared intensely, nevertheless when someone <pb xml:id="v.10.p.219"/> accused him of a bad and unjust decision in court, said: <q>I wish Thrasea were as good a friend to me as he is a most excellent judge.</q></p>
<p rend="indent"> And it is not a bad method for confounding persons of a different kind, men who are naturally vicious and prone to evil conduct, to mention to them some enemy of theirs who is of finer character and to say: <q>He would not have said that or done that.</q> And some men, too, when they do wrong, should be reminded of their excellent fathers, as Homer says: <quote rend="blockquote">Truly not much like his sire is the son who was gotten by Tydeus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> v. 800, referring to Diomedes.</note>;</quote> And Appius, when competing with Scipio Africanus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Scipio Africanus the younger (185-129 b.c.) was the son of Lucius Aemilius Paulus.</note> in the elections, said: <q>O Paulus, how you would groan in the lower world if you saw that when your son was standing for the censorship Philonicus the publican acted as his bodyguard!</q> Such sayings serve at once to rebuke wrongdoers and to add lustre to those who administer the rebuke. And the Nestor of Sophocles, too, made a statesmanlike reply when reviled by Ajax: <quote rend="blockquote">I blame thee not; for good thy acts, though ill thy speech.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 312, no. 771.</note> </quote> And Cato, although he had opposed Pompey in the violent measures which he and Caesar applied to the State, when war broke out between them advised handing over the leadership to Pompey, saying: <q>The men who can bring about great evils can also end them.</q> For blame wThich is mingled with praise and contains nothing insulting but merely frankness <pb xml:id="v.10.p.221"/> of speech, and arouses not anger but a pricking of the conscience and repentance, appears both kindly and healing; but abusive speech is not at all fitting for statesmen. Observe the things that were said by Demosthenes against Aeschines and by Aeschines against him and again those which Hypereides wrote against Demades, and ask yourself if a Solon or a Pericles or Lycurgus the Lacedaemonian or Pittacus the Lesbian would have said them. And yet even Demosthenes employs abuse only in his speeches before a court of law; the Philippics are free from all jeering and scurrility. For such things bring disgrace upon the speakers rather than upon those spoken of, and moreover they bring confusion into the conduct of affairs and they disturb councils and assemblies. Therefore Phocion did well when he stopped speaking and yielded the floor to a man who was reviling him, and then, when the fellow had at last become silent, came forward again saying: <q>Well, then, about the cavalry and the heavy infantry you have heard already; it remains for me to discuss the light infantry and the targeteers.</q> But since many men find it hard to endure that sort of thing quietly, and abusive speakers are often, and not without general benefit, made to shut their mouths by the retorts they evoke, let the reply be brief in wording, showing no temper and no extreme rancour, but urbanity mingled with playfulness and grace which somehow or other has a sting in it. Retorts which turn his own words back upon the speaker are especially good in this way. For just as things which are thrown and return to the thrower seem to do this because they are driven back by some force and firmness of that against <pb xml:id="v.10.p.223"/> which they are thrown, so that which is spoken seems through the force and intellect of him who has been abused to turn back upon those who uttered the abuse. For example, the retort of Epameinondas to Callistratus, who reproached the Thebans and the Argives because Oedipus killed his f ither and Orestes killed his mother: <q>When we had driven out the doers of those deeds, you took them in,</q> and that of Antalcidas the Spartan to the Athenian who said <q>We have often chased you away from the Cephissus,</q> <q>Yes, but we have never had to chase you from the Eurotas.</q> And Phocion also made a witty retort, when, after Demades had screamed <q>The Athenians will put you to death,</q> he replied, <q>Yes, if they are crazy; but you are the one whom t ley will execute, if they are sane.</q> And Crassus the orator, when Domitius said to him, <q>It was you. was it not, who wept when a lamprey died that you kept in a tank?</q> retorted with the question, <q>It was you, was it not, who buried three wives without shedding a tear?</q> Apt replies of this sort, however,;ire of some use also in life in general. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p rend="indent">There are men who enter upon every kind of public service, as Cato did, claiming that the good citizen ought, so far as in him lies, tc omit no trouble or diligence; and they commend Epameinondas because, when through envy and is an insult he had been appointed <emph>telmarch</emph><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">No such official as <emph>telearchos</emph> is mentioned elsewhere, and the word itself describes no function. On the other hand, <emph>telmarchos</emph> or <emph>telmatarchos</emph>, conjectured independently by Winckelmann and van Herwerden, although not found elsewhere, gives a meaning which accords with Plutarch’s description, <q>official of stagnant pools,</q> or a special kind of collector of refuse and other nuisances from the streets, very like the <emph>koprologoi</emph> of Athens.</note> by the Thebans, he did not neglect his duties, but saying thit not only does the office distinguish the man, but also the man the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.225"/> office, he advanced the <emph>telmarchy</emph> to a position of great consideration and dignity, though previously it had been nothing but a sort of supervision of the alleys for the removal of dung and the draining off of water in the streets. And no doubt I myself seem ridiculous to visitors in our town when I am seen in public, as I often am, engaged in such matters. But I am helped by the remark of Antisthenes which has been handed down to memory; for when someone expressed surprise that he himself carried a dried fish through the market-place, he said, <q>Yes, but it’s for myself</q>; but I, on the other hand, say to those who criticize me for standing and watching tiles being measured or concrete or stones being delivered, that I attend to these things, not for myself, but for my native place. Yes, for there are many other things in regard to which a man would be petty and sordid who managed them for himself and attended to them for his own sake, but if he does it for the public and for the State’s sake, he is not ignoble, on the contrary his attention to duty and his zeal are all the greater when applied to little things. But there are others who think the conduct of Pericles was more dignified and splendid, one of whom is Critolaiis the Peripatetic, who clsims that just as the Salaminia and the Paralus, ships at Athens, were not sent out to sea for every service, but only for necessary and important missions, so the statesman should employ himself for the most momentous and important matters, as does the King of the Universe, <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>For God great things doth take in hand, </l> <l>But small tilings passing by he leaves to chance,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag.

Now there is no difference between him and those who strip for every political activity; they soon cause themselves to be criticized by the multitude; they become unpopular and arouse envy when they are successful, but joy when they meet with failure; and that which was admired in them when they began to hold office results at last in mockery and ridicule. Such are the lines: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Metiochus, you see, is general, Metiochi s inspects the roads, </l> <l>Metiochus inspects the bread, and Metiochus inspects the flour, </l> <l>Metiochus takes care of all things, Metiochus will come to grief.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">From a poet of the Old Comedy, Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com. Att. Frag.</title> iii. p. 629, no. 1325.</note> </l> </quote> He was one of Pericles’ followers and seems to have used the power gained through him in such a way as to arouse odium and disgust. Far the statesman ought, as they say, to find the people fond of him when he comes to them and to leave a longing for <pb xml:id="v.10.p.229"/> him when he is not there; which Scipio Africanus accomplished by spending much of his time in the country, thereby at one and the same time removing the weight of envy and giving a breathing-space to those who thought they were oppressed by his glory. But Timesias of Clazomenae was in other respects a good man in his service to the State, but by doing everything himself he had aroused rancour and hatred; but of this he was unaware until the following incident took place: - Some boys were knocking a knuckle-bone out of a hole when he was passing by; and some of them said it was still in the hole, but the boy who had struck at it said: <q>I’d like to knock the brains out of Timesias as truly as this has been knocked out of the hole.</q> Timesias, hearing this and understanding that dislike of him had permeated all the people, returned home and told his wife what had happened; and directing her to pack up and follow him, he went immediately away from his house and out from the city. And it appears that Themistocles, when he met with some such treatment from the Athenians, said, <q>Why, my dear people, are you tired of receiving repeated benefits?</q></p>
<p rend="indent"> Now of such sayings some are well said, others are not. For so far as goodwill and solicitude for the common weal are concerned, a statesman should not hold aloof from any part of public affairs, but should pay attention to them all and infoim himself about all details; nor should he, as the ship’s gear called sacred<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Meaning the largest anchor, held in reserve and used only in a crisis; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> below, 815 d and Lucian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Iuppiter Tragoedus</title>, chap. li. and scholium.</note> is stowed apart, hold himself aloof, waiting for the extreme necessities and fortunes of the State; but just as pilots do some things wit i their own hands but perform other duties by means of different instruments operated by different agents, thus giving <pb xml:id="v.10.p.231"/> a turn or a twist to the instruments while they sit apart, and they make use of sailors, look-out men, and boatswains, some of whom they often call to the stern and entrust with the tiller, just so it is fitting that the statesman should yield office to others and should invite them to the orators’ platform in a gracious and kindly manner, and he should not try to administer all the affairs of the State by his own speeches, decrees, and actions, but should have good, trustworthy men and employ each of them for each particular service according to his fitness. So Pericles made use of Menippus for the position of general, humbled the Council of the Areopagus by means of Ephialtes, passed the decree against the Megarians<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Passed in 432 b.c. excluding Megara from commerce with Athens and her allies.</note> by means of Charinus, and sent Lampon out as founder of Thurii. For, when power seems to be distributed among many, not only does the weight of hatreds and enmities become less troublesome, but there is also greater efficiency in the conduct of affairs. For just as the division of the hand into fingers does not make it weak, but renders it a more skillful instrument for use, so the statesman who gives to others a share in the government makes action more effective by co-operation. But he who through insatiable greed of fame or power puts the whole burden of the State upon himself and sets himself even to tasks for which he is not fitted by nature or by training (as Cleon set himself to leading armies, Philopoemen to commanding ships, and Hannibal to haranguing the people) - such a man has no excuse when he makes mistakes, but will have to hear Euripides quoted to boot, <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>A joiner thou, yet didst a task essay </l> <l>That was no carpentry.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag.

Rut Pericles divided the power with Cimon so that he should himself be ruler in the city and Cimon should man the ships and wage war against the barbarians; for one of them was more gifted for civic government, the other for war. And Eubulus the Anaphlystian also is commended because, although few men enjoyed so much confidence and power as he, yet he administered none of the Hellenic affairs<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Negotiations with other Greek states.</note> and did not take the post of general, but applied himself to the finances, increased the revenues, and did the State much good thereby. But Iphicrates was jeered at when he did exercises in speaking at his home in the presence of many hearers; for even if he had been a good speaker, and not, as he was, a poor one, he ought to have been contented with glory in arms and to have left the school to the sophists. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p rend="indent">But since there is in every democracy a spirit of malice and fault-finding directed against men in public life, and they suspect that many desirable measures, if there is no party opposition and no expression of dissent, are done by conspiracy, and this subjects a man’s associations and friends to calumny, statesmen ought not to let any real enmity or disagreement against themselves subsist, as Onomademus the popular leader of the Chians did when, after his victory in the factional strife, he refused to have all his opponents banished from the city, <q>that we may not,</q> he said <q>begin to quarrel with our friends when we have altogether got rid of our enemies.</q> Now that was silly; but when the populace <pb xml:id="v.10.p.235"/> are suspicious about some important and salutary measure, the statesmen when they come to the assembly ought not all to express the same opinion, as if by previous agreement, but two or three of the friends should dissent and quietly speak on the other side, then change their position as if they had been convinced; for in this way they draw the people along with them, since they appear to be influenced only by the public advantage. In small matters, however, which do not amount to much, it is not a bad thing to let one’s friends really disagree, each following his own reasoning, that in matters of the highest importance their agreement upon the best policy may not seem to be prearranged. </p> </div>

Indeed there are many acts of the Greeks of former times by recounting which the statesman can mould and correct the characters of our contemporaries, for example, at Athens by calling to mind, not deeds in war, but such things as the decree of amnesty after the downfall of the Thirty Tyrants, the fining of Phrynichus for presenting in a tragedy the capture of Miletus, their decking their heads with garlands when Cassander refounded Thebes; how, when they heard of the clubbing at Argos, in which the Argives killed fifteen hundred of their own citizens, they decreed that an expiatory sacrifice be carried about in the assembly; and how, when they were searching the houses at the time of Harpalus’s frauds,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Thirty Tyrants at Athens were overthrown in 403 b.c.; Phrynichus presented the tragedy shortly after Miletus was captured by the Persians in 494 b.c.; Cassander refounded Thebes in 316-315 b.c., ten years after its destruction by Alexander; the clubbing of aristocrats at Argos by the mob took place in 370 b.c.; Harpalus, Alexander’s treasurer, brought to Athens in 329 b.c. funds stolen from Alexander and was supposed to have bribed many prominent Athenians, one of whom was Demosthenes.</note> they passed by only one, that of a newly married man.

     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p rend="indent">However, the statesman, while making his native State readily obedient to its sovereigns, must not further humble it; nor, when the leg has been fettered, go on and subject the neck to the yoke, as some do who, by referring everything, great or small, to the sovereigns, bring the reproach of slavery upon their country, or rather wholly destroy its constitutional government,making it dazed, timid, and powerless in everything. For just as those who have become accustomed neither to dine nor to bathe except by the physician’s orders do not even enjoy that degree of health which nature grants them, so those who invite the sovereign’s decision on every decree, meeting of a council, granting of a privilege,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This doubtless refers to honorary citizenship, crowns, statues, and the like.</note> or administrative measure, force their sovereign to be their master more than he desires. And the cause of this is chiefly the greed and contentiousness of the foremost citizens; for either, in cases in which they are injuring their inferiors, they force them into exile from the State, or, in matters concerning which they differ among themselves, since they are unwilling <pb xml:id="v.10.p.245"/> to occupy an inferior position among their fellow-citizens, they call in those who are mightier; and as a result senate, popular assembly, courts, and the entire local government lose their authority. But the statesman should soothe the ordinary citizens by granting them equality and the powerful by concessions in return, thus keeping them within the bounds of the local government and solving their difficulties as if they were diseases, making for them, as it were, a sort of secret political medicine; he will prefer to be himself defeated among his fellow-citizens rather than to be successful by outraging and destroying the principles of justice in his own city and he will beg everyone else to do likewise, and will teach them how great an evil is contentiousness. But as it is, not only do they not make honourable and gracious compromises with their fellow-citizens and tribesmen<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The citizens of most ancient states were divided into tribes or clans.</note> at home and with their neighbours and colleagues in office, but they carry their dissensions outside to the doors of professional orators and put them in the hands of lawyers, to their own great injury and disgrace. For when physicians cannot entirely eradicate diseases, they turn them outwards to the surface of the body; but the statesman, if he cannot keep the State entirely free from troubles, will at any rate try to cure and control whatever disturbs it and causes sedition, keeping it meanwhile hidden within the State, so that it may have as little need as possible of physicians and medicine drawn from outside.

For this is noble; and besides being noble, one man’s excellence and wisdom by arousing admiration has often mitigated anger which has been <pb xml:id="v.10.p.249"/> aroused against the whole people and has dissipated the threatened terror and bitterness. Something of that sort seems to have happened to the Persian king in the case of Boulis and Sperchis<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The story of these two is told in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 235 f, 236.</note> the Spartans, and happened to Pompey in the case of Sthenno,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 203 d, where the name is Sthennius, and <title rend="italic">Life of Pompey</title>, chap. x.</note> when, as he was going to punish the Mamertines for revolting, Sthenno told him that he would be doing wrong if he should destroy many innocent men for the fault of one; for, he said, it was he himself who had caused the city to revolt by persuading his friends and compelling his enemies. This so affected Pompey that he let the city go unpunished and also treated Sthenno kindly. But Sulla’s guest-friend, practising virtue of the same sort but not having to do with the same sort of man, met with a noble end. For when Sulla, after the capture of Praenestê, was going to slaughter all the rest of the citizens but was letting that one man go on account of his guest-friendship, he declared that he would not be indebted for his life to the slayer of his fatherland, and then mingled with his fellow-citizens and was cut down with them. However, we must pray to be spared such crises and must hope for better things. </p> </div>

Frag.</title> iii. p. 495.</note> </quote> but all alike by vote of the people, and that they bear goodwill toward one another as a heritage, so to speak, from their fatherland. At any rate Scipio was criticized in Rome because, when he entertained his friends at the dedication of the temple of Hercules, he did not include his colleague Mummius; for even if in general the two men did not consider themselves friends, on such occasions they usually thought it proper to show honour and friendliness to each other on account of their office. Inasmuch, therefore, as the omission of so slight an act of courtesy brought a reputation for haughtiness to Scipio, a man in other respects admirable, how can anyone be considered honourable and fair-minded who detracts from the dignity of a colleague in office, or maliciously flouts him by actions which reveal ambitious rivalry, or is so self-willed that he arrogates and annexes to himself everything, in short, at the expense of his colleague? I recollect that when I was still a young man I was sent with another as envoy to <pb xml:id="v.10.p.253"/> the proconsul; the other man was somehow left behind; I alone met the proconsul and accomplished the business. Now when I came back and was to make the report of our mission, my father left his seat and told me in private not to say <q>I went,</q> but <q>we went,</q> not <q>I said,</q> but <q>we said,</q> and in all other ways to associate my colleague in a joint report. For that sort of thing is not only honourable and kind, but it also takes the sting out of any envy of our reputation. And therefore great men ascribe to God and to Fortune a share in their successes, as Timoleon, who put down the tyrannies in Sicily, founded a sanctuary of Automatia (Chance); and Python, when he was admired and honoured by the Athenians for slaying Cotys, said <q>God did this, borrowing from me the hand that did the deed.</q> And Theopompus, King of the Lacedaemonians, replied to the man who said that Sparta was preserved because the kings were fitted to rule, <q>No, it is rather because the people are fitted to obey.</q> </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p rend="indent">Now both of these arise from each other. Most people say and believe that it is the business of political teaching to cause men to be good subjects; for, they say, the subject class is in every State larger than the ruling class; and each official rules but a short time, whereas he is ruled all the time, if he is a citizen of a democracy; so that it is a most excellent and useful thing to learn to obey those in authority, even if they happen to be deficient in power and reputation. For it is absurd that in a tragedy the chief actor, even though he is <pb xml:id="v.10.p.255"/> a Theodorus or a Polus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Theodorus and Polus were famous actors at Athens in the fourth century b.c.

So at Sparta the kings gave precedence to the ephors, and if any other Spartan was summoned, he did not walk slowly in obeying the summons, but by running eagerly at full speed through the market-place they exhibited to their fellow-citizens their spirit of obedience, rejoicing in paying honour to their rulers. They did not behave like some uncultured and unmannerly persons who, as if swaggering in the excess of their own power, abuse the umpires at the games, revile the choregi at the Dionysiac festival, and jeer at generals and gymnasiarchs, not knowing and not understanding that it is often more glorious to pay honour than to receive it. For to a man who has great power in the State greater distinction accrues through serving in the bodyguard and the escort of an official than through being so served and escorted by him, or rather the latter brings him dislike and <pb xml:id="v.10.p.257"/> envy, but the former brings true reputation, that which comes from goodwill; and by being seen sometimes at the official’s door, by greeting him first, and by putting him in the middle place<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">.

But if there is in them any reluctance, delay, or ill-will as to putting such suggestions into effect, then a man ought to come forward of himself and address the people, and he should not neglect or slight the public interests on the ground that because someone else is in office <pb xml:id="v.10.p.259"/> it is not proper for him to meddle and mix in the administration of affairs.

And of Philopoemen’s deeds the most brilliant is this, that when Nabis had taken Messenê, and the general of the Achaeans was so cowardly that he would not go to the assistance of the place, he himself with the most eager patriots set out and took the city without any decree of the council. Certainly it is well to make innovations, not for the sake of small or casual matters, but in cases of necessity, as Philopoemen did, or for glorious causes, as Epameinondas did when contrary to the law he added four months to the Boeotarchy,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >The Boeotarchy was the chief office of the Boeotian confederacy.

Alexander, for example, when he heard that his sister had had intercourse with a handsome young man, did not burst into a rage, but merely remarked that she also ought to be allowed to get some enjoyment out of her royal station. In making such concessions he did not act rightly or in a manner worthy of himself; for the weakening of a throne and outrageous conduct should not be regarded as mere enjoyment. But to the people the statesman will, so far as is possible, permit no outrageous conduct towards the citizens, no confiscation of others’ property, nor distribution <pb xml:id="v.10.p.263"/> of public funds, but by persuasion, arguments, and threats he will oppose to the bitter end desires of that sort, by nourishing and increasing which Cleon and his partizans produced in the State, as Plato says,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 552 c, d.</note> a swarm of drones with stings. But if the people, taking an ancestral festival or the worship of some god as a pretext, are bent upon some public spectacle or a slight distribution of funds, or a gift for the general good or some lavish show prompted by private ambition, for such purposes let them reap the benefit both of their generosity and of their prosperity. Why, among the public acts of Pericles and of Demetrius are many of that sort, and Cimon beautified the market-place by planting plane-trees and laying out walks. And Cato, seeing that the people was being greatly stirred up by Caesar in the affair of Catiline and was dangerously inclined towards a revolution, persuaded the senate to vote a dole to the poor, and the giving of this halted the disturbance and ended the uprising. For just as a physician, after drawing off a great deal of infected blood, supplies a little harmless nourishment, so the statesman, after doing away with something big which was discreditable or harmful, appeases the spirit of discontent and fault-finding by some slight and kindly act of favour. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p rend="indent">It is also expedient to divert the people’s interest to other useful things, as Demades did when he had the revenues of the State in his charge; for when the people were eager to send out triremes to aid those who were in revolt against Alexander,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >In 330 b.c. King Agis of Sparta headed the revolt.</note> and were urging him to furnish funds, <q>You have,</q> he said, <q>funds available, for I have made preparations <pb xml:id="v.10.p.265"/> for the Pitcher Festival<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The second day of the <title rend="italic">Anthesteria</title>, a three-day festival in worship of Dionysus, held in early spring at Athens.</note> so that each of you is to receive a half-mina, but if you had rather apply the funds to this other purpose, use your own money for the festival.</q> And in this way, since they gave up the expedition in order not to lose the distribution of money, he removed any ground of complaint on Alexander’s part against the people of Athens. For there are many unprofitable measures which the statesman cannot avert by direct means, but he must use some sort of roundabout and circuitous methods, such as Phocion employed when ordered at an inopportune time to invade Boeotia. He immediately issued a proclamation<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">. Life of Phocion</title>, chap. xxiv.</note> calling all those from the age of military service up to sixty years to join the ranks, and when the older men made a violent protest, he said: <q>What is there terrible about it? For I, your general, who am eighty years old, shall be with you.</q> So in this way we should prevent inopportune embassies by listing among the envoys many who are not qualified to go, and useless construction by calling for contributions, and improper lawsuits and missions abroad by ordering the parties to appear in court together and together to go abroad on the missions. And those who propose such measures and incite the people to adopt them should be the first to be haled into court and made to take the responsibility for putting them into effect; for so they will either draw back and appear to be themselves nullifying the measure or they will stick to it and share its unpleasant features. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p rend="indent">When, however, something important and useful but requiring much conflict and serious effort is to be accomplished, then try to select from among your friends those who are most powerful, or from <pb xml:id="v.10.p.267"/> among the most powerful those who are easiest to get along with; for they are least likely to act against you and most likely to work with you, since they possess wisdom without contentiousness. And, moreover, you should know your own nature and choose for any purpose for which you are naturally less fitted than others, men who are more able rather than men like yourself, as Diomedes chose to go with him on the scouting expedition the man of prudence and passed over the men of courage.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Homer, <title rend="italic" >Il.</title> x. 243. He chose Odysseus.</note> For actions are thus more equally balanced, and contention does not arise among men whose ambitions proceed from different virtues and abilities. So, if you are not a good speaker, take an orator as your assistant in a lawsuit or your colleague in an embassy, as Pelopidas took Epameinondas; and if, like Callicratidas, you are too lofty of speech and not persuasive in addressing the masses, choose a man who is winning in his speech and conciliatory; and if you are physically weak and incapable of hard work, choose a man who is fond of labour and strong, as Nicias chose Lamachus. For on this principle Geryon would have been enviable for having many legs, arms, and eyes, if he had directed them all by one mind. But statesmen, by uniting for one purpose not only men’s persons and funds, but also their fortunes, abilities, and virtues, if they are in agreement, can gain greater reputation in connexion with the same action than by other means, not behaving like the Argonauts, who left Heracles behind and then were forced to work through the women’s quarters<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This refers to Jason’s seduction of Medea.</note> and use magic and drugs to save themselves and steal the golden fleece. <pb xml:id="v.10.p.269"/></p>
<p rend="indent"> When entering some sanctuaries men leave their gold outside; but iron, one may say, they do not at all carry into any sanctuary.

And therefore there is no need of saying much about these evils. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p rend="indent">But ambition, although it is a more pretentious word than <q>covetousness,</q> is no less pernicious in the State; for there is more daring in it; since it is innate, not in slothful and abject spirits, but in the most vigorous and impetuous, and the surge which comes from the masses, raising it on the crest of the wave and sweeping it along by shouts of praise, often makes it unrestrained and unmanageable. Therefore, just as Plato said<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 416 e.</note> that young people should be told from childhood that it is not proper for them to wear gold on their persons or to possess it, since they have a gold of their own mingled in their souls, - a figurative reference, I believe, to the virtue derived by descent, which permeates their natures, - so let us moderate our <pb xml:id="v.10.p.271"/> ambition, saying that we have in ourselves honour, a gold uncorrupted, undefiled, and unpolluted by envy and fault-finding, which increases along with reasoning and the contemplation of our acts and public measures. Therefore we have no need of honours painted, modelled, or cast in bronze, in which even that which is admired is really the work of another; for the person who receives praise is not the man for whom the <q>trumpeter</q> or the <q>doryphorus,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Two famous statues. The doryphorus (spear-bearer) was by Polycleitus.</note> for example, was made, but the man by whom it was made. Cato, Rome then beginning to be full of portrait statues, refused to let one be made of himself, saying, <q>I prefer to have people ask why there is not a statue of me rather than why there is one.</q> Such honours do indeed arouse envy, and the people think that they are themselves under obligations to men who have not received them, but that those who have received them are oppressors of the people, as men who demand payment for their services. Therefore, just as a man who has sailed past the Syrtis and is then capsized at the channel has done nothing so very great or glorious, so the man who has watched over the treasury and the public revenue, but is then found wanting in the presidency or the prytany, is indeed dashed against a lofty promontory, but gets a ducking all the same. No, that man is the best who wants no such things and even avoids and refuses them when offered. But if it is not easy to reject some favour or some kindly sentiment of the people, when it is so inclined, for men engaged in a political struggle for which the prize is not money or gifts, but which is <pb xml:id="v.10.p.273"/> a truly sacred contest worthy of a crown,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The prizes at the Olympic, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean games were crowns of wild olive, laurel, pine, and parsley respectively.</note> a mere inscription suffices, a tablet, a decree, or a green branch such as Epimenides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Epimenides of Crete was called in by the Athenians, apparently not far from 500 b.c., to purify the city of a pestilence.</note> received from the Acropolis after purifying the city. And Anaxagoras, giving up the honours which had been granted him, requested that on the day of his death the children be allowed to play and be free from their lessons. And to the seven Persians who killed the magi the privilege was granted that they and their descendants should wear their headdress tilted forward over the forehead; for they made this, so it appears, their secret sign when they undertook their act. And there is something that indicates public spirit, too, about the honour received by Pittacus; for, when he was told to take as much as he wished of the land which he had gained for the citizens, he took only as much as he could throw a javelin over. And the Roman Codes received as much as he - and he was lame-could plough around in one day. For the honour should not be payment for the action, but a symbol, that it may last for a long time, as those just mentioned have lasted. But of all the three hundred statues of Demetrius of Phalerum not one acquired rust or dirt; they were all destroyed while he was still living; and those of Demades were melted down into chamber-pots. Things like that have happened to many honours, they having become offensive, not only because the recipient was worthless, but also because the gift bestowed was too great. And therefore the best and surest way to ensure the duration of honours is to reduce their <pb xml:id="v.10.p.275"/> cost but those which are great and top-heavy and weighty are, like ill-proportioned statues, quickly overturned. </p> </div>

     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p rend="indent">So of all kinds of love that which is engendered in states and peoples for an individual because of his virtue is at once the strongest and the most divine; but those falsely named and falsely attested honours which are derived from giving theatrical performances, making distributions of money, or offering gladiatorial shows, are like harlots’ flatteries, since the masses always smile upon him who gives to them and does them favours, granting him an ephemeral and uncertain reputation. And so he who first said that the people was ruined by the first man who bought its favour was well aware that the multitude loses its strength when it succumbs to bribe-taking; but those also who give such bribes should bear in mind that they are destroying themselves when they purchase reputation by great expenditures, thus making the multitude strong and bold in the thought that they have power to give and take away something important. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p rend="indent">We ought not, however, on this account to be niggardly as to the customary public contributions, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.281"/> if we are in prosperous circumstances; since the masses are more hostile to a rich man who does not give them a share of his private possessions than to a poor man who steals from the public funds, for they think the former’s conduct is due to arrogance and contempt of them, but the latter’s to necessity. First, then, let the gifts be made without bargaining for anything; for so they surprise and overcome the recipients more completely; and secondly they should be given on some occasion which offers a good and excellent pretext, one which is connected with the worship of a god and leads the people to piety; for at the same time there springs up in the minds of the masses a strong disposition to believe that the deity is great and majestic, when they see the men whom they themselves honour and regard as great so liberally and zealously vying with each other in honouring the divinity. Therefore, just as Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 398 e.</note> withheld the Lydian and the Ionian musical modes from the education of the young, because the one arouses that part of the soul which is inclined towards mourning and grief and the other strengthens that part which readily slips into pleasures and grows wanton, so you must, if possible, remove from the State all those free exhibitions which excite and nourish the murderous and brutal or the scurrilous and licentious spirit, or if you cannot do that, avoid them and oppose the multitude when they demand them. But always make the objects of your expenditures useful and moderate, having as their purpose either what is good or what is necessary, or at any rate what is pleasant and agreeable without anything harmful or outrageous in it. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p rend="indent">But if your property is moderate and in relation <pb xml:id="v.10.p.283"/> to your needs strictly circumscribed <q>as by centre and radius,</q> it is neither ignoble nor humiliating at all to confess your poverty and to withdraw from among those who have the means for public expenditures, instead of borrowing money and making yourself at once a pitiful and a ridiculous object in the matter of your public contributions; for men are plainly seen to lack resources when they keep annoying their friends or truckling to money-lenders; so that it is not reputation or power, but rather shame and contempt, which they acquire by such expenditures. And therefore it is always desirable in connexion with such things to remember Lamachus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Lamachus was an Athenian general who was killed in the battle at the Anapus near Syracuse in 414 b.c.</note> and Phocion<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Phocion was a famous Athenian general in the fourth century b.c. He was elected general forty-five times. He was virtual ruler of Athens when Antipater was in power, but in 318 b.c. was tried and executed by the Athenians. Soon after that a public burial and a statue were decreed for him. The story told here is found also in the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, p. 533 a.</note>; for the latter, when the Athenians at a sacrifice called upon him to contribute and repeatedly raised a clamour, said, <q>I should be ashamed if I gave you a contribution and did not pay Callicles here what I owe him,</q> pointing to his money-lender. And Lamachus always, when he was general, entered in his accounts money for shoes and a cloak for himself. And when Hermon tried to avoid office on the plea of poverty, the Thessalians voted to give him a flask<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">About six pints.</note> of wine monthly and a measure<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">About a bushel and a half.</note> of meal every four days. So it is not ignoble to confess poverty, and poor men, if by reason of their virtue they enjoy freedom of speech and public confidence, have no less influence in their cities than those who give public entertainments and exhibitions. The statesman must, then, do his best to control himself in such matters and not go down <pb xml:id="v.10.p.285"/> into the plain on foot to fight with cavalry; if he is poor, he must not produce foot-races, theatrical shows, and banquets in competition with the rich for reputation and power, but he should vie with those who try always to lead the State on the strength of virtue and wisdom, combined with reason, for in such are found not only nobility and dignity but also the power to win and attract the people, a thing <q>more desirable than gold coins of Croesus.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Pollux, iii. 87, ix. 85, but, as Bernardakis suggests, Plutarch may have added the word for <q>more desirable,</q> in which case there is here no real quotation.</note> For the good man is neither presumptuous nor offensive, and the prudent man is not over-blunt in speech, nor does he <quote rend="blockquote">Walk with a mien his townsmen bitter find,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag.

And, moreover, he shows himself a kindly counsellor, an advocate who accepts no fee, and a kind-hearted conciliator when husbands are at variance with their wives or friends with one another. He spends no <pb xml:id="v.10.p.287"/> small part of the day engaged in the public business on the orators’ platform of the senate or the assembly, and thenceforth all the rest of his life he <quote rend="blockquote">Draws to himself as north-east wind draws clouds<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag.

But since he is always devoting his thoughts to the public weal and regards public office as his life and his work, not, like most people, as an interruption to leisure and a compulsory expense, - by all these and similar qualities he turns and attracts the people towards himself, for they see that the flatteries and enticements of others are spurious and counterfeit when compared with his care and forethought. The flatterers of Demetrius would not address the other monarchs as kings, but called Seleucus <q>Ruler of Elephants</q> and Lysimachus <q>Guardian of the Treasure</q> and Ptolemy <q>Admiral of the Fleet</q> and Agathocles <q>Lord of the Isles</q>; but the multitude, even if at first they reject the good and wise man, afterwards, when they have become acquainted with his truthfulness and his character, consider him alone a statesmanlike, public-spirited man and a ruler, whereas they consider and call the others, one a provider of choruses, one a giver of banquets, and one a director of athletics. Then, just as at banquets, though Callias or Alcibiades pay the bill, it is Socrates to whom they listen, and Socrates on whom all eyes are turned, so in States in which the conditions are sound Ismenias makes contributions, Lichas gives dinners, and Niceratus provides choruses, but it is Epameinondas, Aristeides, and Lysander who are the rulers, public <pb xml:id="v.10.p.289"/> men, and generals. So, observing these things, we must not be humiliated or overwhelmed by the reputation with the masses gained from theatres, kitchens, and assembly-halls, remembering that it lasts but a short time and ends the minute the gladiatorial and dramatic shows are over, since there is nothing honourable or dignified in it. </p> </div>
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p rend="indent">Now those who are skilled in tending and keeping bees think that the hive which hums loudest and is most full of noise is thriving and in good condition; but he to whom God has given the care of the rational and political swarm will judge of its happiness chiefly by the quietness and tranquillity of the people; he will accept and imitate to the best of his ability the other precepts of Solon, but will wonder in great perplexity why that great man prescribed that in case of factional disorder whoever joined neither faction should be deprived of civic rights. For in a body afflicted with disease the beginning of a change to health does not come from the diseased parts, but it comes when the condition in the healthy parts gains strength and drives out that which is contrary to nature; and in a people afflicted with faction, if it is not dangerous and destructive but is destined to cease sometime, there must be a strong, permanent, and permeating admixture of sanity and soundness; for to this element there flows from the men of understanding that which is akin to it, and then it permeates the part which is diseased; but States which have fallen into complete disorder are utterly ruined unless they meet with some external necessity and chastisement and are thus forcibly compelled by their misfortunes to be reasonable. Yet certainly it is not fitting in time <pb xml:id="v.10.p.291"/> of disorder to sit without feeling or grief, singing the praises of your own impassiveness and of the inactive and blessed life,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This refers to the doctrine held by the Epicurean and Sceptic Schools of philosophy that the perfect state is that of complete tranquillity.</note> and rejoicing in the follies of others; on the contrary, at such times you should by all means put on the buskin of Theramenes,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Theramenes was prominent in the oligarchy at Athens in 411 b.c., but later turned against his former associates. In 404 b.c. he was elected one of the <q>Thirty Tyrants,</q> but tried to restrain his colleagues and was put to death by them. He was nicknames Cothurnus because the buskin could be worn on either foot, as he was a member of each party in turn (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <q>turncoat</q>). Aristotle, <title rend="italic" >Constitution of Athens</title>, 28. 5. praises him as a patriot.</note> conversing with both parties and joining neither; for you will appear to be, not an outsider by not joining in wrongdoing, but a common partisan of all by coming to their aid; and your not sharing in their misfortunes will not arouse envy, if it is plain that you sympathize with all alike. But the best thing is to see to it in advance that factional discord shall never arise among them and to regard this as the greatest and noblest function of what may be called the art of statesmanship. For observe that of the greatest blessings which States can enjoy, - peace, liberty, plenty, abundance of men, and concord, - so far as peace is concerned the peoples have no need of statesmanship at present; for all war, both Greek and foreign,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the phrase <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Thucydides, ii. 364.</note> has been banished from among us and has disappeared; and of liberty the peoples have as great a share as our rulers grant them, and perhaps more would not be better for them; but bounteous productiveness of the soil, kindly tempering of the seasons, that wives may bear <q>children like to their sires,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hesiod, <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 233.</note> and that the offspring may live in safety - these things the wise man will ask the gods in his prayers to grant his fellow-citizens. <pb xml:id="v.10.p.293"/></p>
<p rend="indent"> There remains, then, for the statesman, of those activities which fall within his province, only this - and it is the equal of any of the other blessings: - always to instil concord and friendship in those who dwell together with him and to remove strifes, discords, and all enmity. He will talk, as in the case of quarrels among friends, first with the persons who think they are the more aggrieved, and will appear to share their feeling of wrong and anger, then he will try in this way to mollify them and teach them that those who let wrongs go unheeded are superior to those who are quarrelsome and try to compel and overcome others, not only in reasonableness and character, but also in wisdom and greatness of spirit, and that by yielding in a small thing they gain their point in the best and most important matters. Then he will instruct his people both individually and collectively and will call attention to the weak condition of Greek affairs, in which it is best for wise men to accept one advantage - a life of harmony and quiet - since fortune has left us no prize open for competition. For what dominion, what glory is there for those who are victorious? What sort of power is it which a small edict of a proconsul may annul or transfer to another man and which, even if it last, has nothing in it seriously worth while? But just as a conflagration does not often begin in sacred or public places, but some lamp left neglected in a house or some burnt rubbish causes a great flame and works public destruction, so disorder in a State is not always kindled by contentions about public matters, but frequently differences arising from private affairs and offences pass thence into public life and throw the whole State into confusion. <pb xml:id="v.10.p.295"/> Therefore it behoves the statesman above all things to remedy or prevent these, that some of them may not arise at all and some may be quickly ended and others may not grow great and extend to public interests, but may remain merely among the persons who are at odds with one another. He should do this by noticing himself and pointing out to others that private troubles become the causes of public ones and small troubles of great ones, if they are overlooked and do not in the beginning receive treatment or soothing counsel.</p>
<p rend="indent"> For example, at Delphi the greatest insurrection is said to have been caused by Crates, whose daughter was to be married to Orsilaüs, the son of Phalis; but then, when at the betrothal the mixing-bowl broke in the middle of its own accord, Orsilaüs regarded that as an omen, left his bride, and went away with his father. But Crates a little later, secretly putting a sacred object of gold into their possession while they were sacrificing, caused Orsilaüs and his brother to be hurled over the precipice without trial and later slew some of their friends and relatives when they were suppliants in the sanctuary of Athena-before-the-Temple. But after many such things had taken place the Delphians put Crates and his fellow-partisans to death, and with their property, which had been declared accursed, they built the lower temples. And at Syracuse there were two young men, intimate friends, one of whom, being entrusted with his friend’s beloved for safe-keeping, seduced him while the other was away; then the latter, as if to repay outrage with outrage, committed adultery with the offender’s wife. Thereupon one of the elder men came forward in the senate and <pb xml:id="v.10.p.297"/> moved that both be banished before the State reap the result and be infected with enmity through them. His motion, however, was not carried, and from this beginning disorder arose which caused great disasters and overthrew the most excellent government. And indeed you yourself also no doubt have excellent examples at home in the enmity of Pardalas and Tyrrhenus, which came near to destroying Sardis by involving the State in rebellion and war as the result of petty private matters.</p>
<p rend="indent"> Therefore the statesman should not despise such offences as may, like diseases in a person, spread quickly, but he should take hold of them, suppress them, and cure them. For by attention, as Cato says, the great is made small and the small is reduced to nothing. And for this there is no more persuasive device than for the statesman to show himself in his private differences mild and conciliatory, persisting without anger in his original reasons for disagreement, and treating no one with contentiousness, anger, or any other passion which injects harsha ness and bitterness into unavoidable disputes. For we put soft gloves on the hands of those who compete in the boxing-school, that the contest may not have a fatal result, its blows being soft and not painful; and in law-suits against one’s fellow-citizens it is better to treat the causes of disagreement pure and simple in one’s pleading, and not, by sharpening and poisoning matters, as if they were darts or arrows, with bad words, malice, and threats, to make them incurable, great, and of public importance. <pb xml:id="v.10.p.299"/> For a man who proceeds in this way towards those with whom he himself has to do will find that others also yield to him; and rivalries affecting public interests, if private enmities are done away with, become of slight importance and do no serious or incurable harm. </p> </div>
