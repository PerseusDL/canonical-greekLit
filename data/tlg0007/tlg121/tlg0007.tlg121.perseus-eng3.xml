				<head>LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS (<foreign xml:lang="lat">VITAE DECEM ORATORUM</foreign>) </head>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent"> At some time in the second century before Christ ten Attic orators were selected, probably by Apollodorus of Pergamum, as the orators whose speeches were most worthy of preservation and study, and this <q>Canon</q> of the Ten Attic Orators was generally accepted. The <title rend="italic">Lives</title> of these orators which are contained in manuscripts of Plutarch’s <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title> were certainly not written by Plutarch. They are altogether lacking in the charm which characterizes Plutarch’s careful and elaborate style. Facts are stated one after another with little variety and with little or no distinction between mere anecdotes and matters of real importance; but the <title rend="italic">Lives</title> are of interest on account of their subject matter. </p> 
<p rend="indent">The <q>decrees</q> appended to the <title rend="italic">Lives</title> are, except in some details, fairly accurate copies of official documents (see F. Ladek, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Wiener Studien</title>, xiii., 1891, pp. Ill ff.). The two which are concerned with Demosthenes and his family are not really decrees, but petitions addressed to the Senate, copies of which were undoubtedly kept among the official records at Athens, whereas the third - that in honour of Lycurgus - is a decree of the people. A large part of the inscription recording this decree has been found and is published in the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Inscriptiones Graecae</title>, ii. No. 240 (editio minor, ii. No. 457), Dittenberger, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.343"/> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum</title>, third edition, No. 326. The text which has been handed down in the manuscripts of Plutarch varies somewhat from that of the inscription, but hardly more than is to be expected. It may well be that whoever appended the <q>decrees</q> to the <title rend="italic">Lives</title> of the orators derived them, not directly from inscriptions or other official documents, but (as suggested by B. Keil in <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxx. pp. 210 ff.) from the work of Heliodorus <title rend="italic">On Monuments</title>. </p> 
<p rend="indent">The <title rend="italic">Lives</title>, with the <q>decrees,</q> are published by Anton Westermann in his <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Biographi Graeci</title> (1833 and 1845). </p> </div>

			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> <head><label>I.</label> ANTIPHON</head> 
				<p rend="indent">Antiphon was the son of Sophilus, and his deme was Rhamnus. He was a pupil of his father (for his father was a sophist, and it is said that Alcibiades as a boy attended his school), and having acquired power in speaking - as some think, through his own natural ability - he entered upon a public career. And he set up a school and had his disagreement with Socrates on the subject of words, not in a contentious spirit, but for the sake of argument, as Xenophon has narrated in his <title rend="italic">Memoirs</title>.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Memorabilia</title>, i. 6.</note> And he wrote some speeches for citizens who wanted them for their suits in the law-courts, being the first who practised this profession, as some say. At any rate no legal oration is extant of any of those who lived before his time, nor of his contemporaries either, because the custom of speech-writing had not yet arisen; there is none by Themistocles, Aristeides, or Pericles, although the times afforded them many opportunities and also occasions when such speeches were needed. And it was not for lack of ability that they refrained from such speech-writing, as is evident from what is said by the historians about each of the abovementioned orators. Yet all those whom we are able to record as having practised this kind of speeches, going back to the earliest occurrence, will be found <pb xml:id="v.10.p.347"/> to have followed Antiphon when he was already old; I mean such as Alcibiades, Critias, Lysias, and Archinus. He was also the first to publish rules of the art of oratory, being of sharp intellect, and for this reason he was nicknamed Nestor. </p> 
<p rend="indent">And Caecilius, in the treatise he compiled about him, conjectures from the terms in which Antiphon is praised in the work of the historian Thucydides that he was the latter’s teacher.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Thucydides, viii. 68 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὴρ Ἀθηναίων τῶν καθ’ ἑαυτόν ἀρετῇ τε οὐδενὸς δεύτερος καὶ κπάτιστος ἐνθυμηθῆναι γενόμενος καὶ ἃ γνοίη εἰπεῖν</foreign>, <q>a man inferior to none of the Athenians of his own day in force of character, and one who had proved himself most able both to formulate a plan and to set forth his conclusions in speech</q> (Smith’s translation, L.C.L.).</note> In his speeches he is accurate and persuasive, clever in invention, ingenious in handling perplexing cases; he attacks unexpectedly, and he addresses his arguments to both the laws and the emotions, aiming especially at propriety. He was born at the time of the Persian wars and of the sophist Gorgias, who was somewhat older than he; and his life extended until the destruction of the democracy by the Four Hundred,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 411 b.c. when for some four months an oligarchy ruled Athens.</note> in causing which he seems himself to have had a part, at one time by being trierarch<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The duty of fitting out ships for the navy devolved upon wealthy citizens, who were then called trierarchs.</note> of two ships, at another by being general<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Antiphon was a common name at Athens in the fifth century. Blass, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Die attische Beredsamkeit</title>, 2nd ed. i. pp. 93 ff., distinguishes, in addition to the orator: (1) a patriotic and worthy citizen (Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Hell.</title> ii. 3. 40) in defence of whose daughter Lysias wrote a speech, and to whom the military activities belong which are here ascribed to the orator; (2) the tragic poet who was put to death by Dionysius of Syracuse (Aristotle, <title rend="italic">Rhet.</title> ii. 6. p. 1385 a 9); (3) Antiphon the sophist (Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Mem.</title> i. 6. 5; Diog. Laert. ii. 5. 25), who is probably the one who practised mental healing at Corinth; (4) the son of Pyrilampus (Plato, <title rend="italic">Parmenides</title>, 127 a); (5) the son of Lysonides (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 833 a); and (6) an Antiphon derided by Aristophanes (<title rend="italic">Wasps</title>, 1270), as a starveling. The Pseudo-Plutarch has evidently fused several of these personalities with that of the orator.</note> and gaining many victories in battle and winning important alliances for the Four Hundred, by arming the men of military age, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.349"/> by manning sixty triremes, and by being on every occasion their envoy to Lacedaemon at the time when Eëtioneia had been fortified.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Eëtioneia, the mole which formed the northern side of the great Harbour of Peiraeus, was fortified by the Four Hundred in order to command the entrance.</note> And after the overthrow of the Four Hundred he was indicted along with Archeptolemus, one of the Four Hundred, was found guilty, subjected to the punishments prescribed for traitors, thrown out unburied, and inscribed along with his descendants in the list of the disfranchised. But some tell us that he was put to death by the Thirty,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 404 b.c., when Athens was occupied by the Lacedaemonians, a body of Thirty men was appointed to revise the constitution. They seized all power and ruled ruthlessly until overthrown in May 403 b.c.</note> as Lysias says in his speech in defence of Antiphon’s daughter; for he had a daughter whom Callaeschrus claimed in marriage by legal process. And that he was put to death by the Thirty is told also by Theopompus in the fifteenth book of his <title rend="italic">Philippics</title> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Müller, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> i. p. 300.</note>; but that must have been another Antiphon, the son of Lysidonides, whom Cratinus also, in his play <title rend="italic">The Flask</title>, mentions as a rascal; for how could a man who had died previously and had been put to death by the Four Hundred be living again in the time of the Thirty? But there is also another story of his death: that he sailed as envoy to Syracuse when the tyranny of Dionysius the First was at its height, and at a convivial gathering the question arose what bronze was the best; then when most of the guests disagreed, he said that bronze was the best from which the statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton were made; and when Dionysius heard this, suspecting that the remark <pb xml:id="v.10.p.351"/> was intended to encourage an attack upon himself, he ordered that Antiphon be put to death. But others say that he was angry because Antiphon made fun of his tragedies. </p> 
<p rend="indent">There are current sixty orations ascribed to this orator, twenty-five of which Caecilius says are spurious. He is ridiculed as a lover of money by Plato in his <title rend="italic">Peisander</title>.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com. Att. Frag.</title> i. p. 629, no. 103.</note> And he is said to have written tragedies both by himself and in collaboration with the tyrant Dionysius. But while he was still busy with poetry he invented a method of curing distress, just as physicians have a treatment for those who are ill; and at Corinth, fitting up a room near the market-place, he wrote on the door that he could cure by words those who were in distress; and by asking questions and finding out the causes of their condition he consoled those in trouble. But thinking this art was unworthy of him he turned to oratory. There are some who ascribe also to Antiphon the book <title rend="italic">On Poets</title> by Glaucus of Rhegium.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Müller, <title rend="italic">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> ii. p. 23.</note> His most admired orations are the one concerning Herodes, that against Erasistratus about the peacocks, that on the Indictment, which he wrote in his own defence, and that against the general Demosthenes for moving an illegal measure. He wrote also a speech against the general Hippocrates and caused him to be convicted by default. </p> 
<p rend="indent">Caecilius has appended a decree passed in the archonship of Theopompus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">411-410 b.c. Caecilius derived his text of the decree from Craterus’s collection of decrees. See Harpocration, <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἄνδρων</foreign> and Blass, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Die attische Beredsamkeit</title>, 2nd ed., i. p. 99.</note> the year in which the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.353"/> Four Hundred were overthrown, according to which the senate voted the trial of Antiphon: <quote rend="blockquote">Voted by the senate on the twenty-first day of the prytany. Demonicus of Alopecê was secretary, Philostratus of Pallenê was president. Andron moved in regard to the men whom the generals denounce for acting to the detriment of the State of the Athenians while serving as envoys to Lacedaemon and for sailing from the camp in a ship of the enemy and for having passed by land through Deceleia, namely Archeptolemus, Onomacles, and Antiphon, that they be arrested and brought before the court for trial. And the generals, with those members of the senate whom they shall co-opt to the number of ten, are directed to produce them in court, that they may be present at the trial. And the Thesmothetae<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Six of the annually elected archons; their duties were to administer the courts of justice.</note> shall summon them to-morrow, and when the summonses have been returned to the court, they shall propose that the chosen prosecutors and the generals and others, if anyone so desire, shall accuse them of treason; and whomsoever the court may convict, he shall be treated in accordance with the law which has been passed relating to traitors.</quote> </p> 
<p rend="indent">Under this enactment the judgement is written: <quote rend="blockquote">Archeptolemus, son of Hippodamus, of Agryle, and Antiphon, son of Sophilus, of Rhamnus, both being present, were found guilty of treason. The sentence passed upon them was that they be handed over to the Eleven for execution, that their belongings be confiscated and ten per cent thereof be given to the Goddess, that their houses be torn down and boundary-stones be set up on their sites with the inscription <q>Land of Archeptolemus and Antiphon the two traitors</q>; and that the two demarchs make a declaration of their <pb xml:id="v.10.p.355"/> property; and that it be forbidden to bury Archeptolemus and Antiphon at Athens or in any place ruled by the Athenians; and that Archeptolemus and Antiphon be attainted, and also their descendants legitimate and illegitimate; and that if anyone shall adopt any descendant of Archeptolemus or Antiphon, he who so adopts shall be attainted; and that this be inscribed on a bronze tablet, which shall be set up where the decrees relating to Phrynichus are placed.</quote> </p> </div>

				<p rend="indent"> Andocides was the son of Leogoras, son of that Andocides who once made peace between the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Thirty Years’ Peace, by the terms of which Athens gave up Megara and its ports in 446-445 b.c.</note>; he was as regards his deme a Cydathenian or a Thorian<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See note <emph>d</emph> below for the source of this error.</note> and was descended from nobles, and even, according to Hellanicus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Müller, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> i. p. 55, no. 78.</note> from Hermes; for the race of heralds traces its origin to him. On this account, too, he was once chosen along with Glaucon to go with twenty ships to aid the Corcyraeans who were embroiled with the Corinthians.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Thucydides, i. 51, who seems to have been the source of this error. The colleague of Glaucon on this expedition was Dracontides, son of Leogoras of Thurae, and not Andocides, who at the time, 433 b.c., was too young. See <title rend="italic">I. G.</title> i. 295 (ed. min.), and Kirchner, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Prosopographia Attica</title>, 828 and 4551.</note> And after this he was accused of impiety as being one of those who mutilated the Hermae<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Hermae, square pillars surmounted by the head of the god Hermes, stood before the doors of Athenian houses. In 415 b.c., just as the great expedition against Sicily was about to sail, these Hermae were systematically mutilated in the night by unknown persons.</note> and as profaning the mysteries of Demeter [because at an earlier time he was <pb xml:id="v.10.p.357"/> dissipated and in a nocturnal revel had broken one of the images of the god, and when he was indicted refused to surrender the slave whom his accusers were looking for, so that he gained a bad name and was suspected and accused in the second suit also, which was brought shortly after the expedition went to Sicily, when the Corinthians sent in men from Leontini and Egesta and, as the Athenians hesitated about aiding them privately, they mutilated the Hermae about the market-place, as Cratippus says, and profaned the mysteries besides]. At his trial on these charges he was acquitted on condition that he should inform against the wrongdoers. He exerted himself greatly and discovered those who were guilty of the sacrilege, among whom he informed against his own father. And he brought about the conviction and death of all the others, but saved his father, although he had already been put in prison, by promising that he would be of great service to the city. And he kept his promise; for Leogoras caused the conviction of many men who were embezzling public funds and committing other misdeeds. And for these reasons he was acquitted of the charge. </p> 
<p rend="indent">But Andocides, since his reputation in public life was not good, took to merchandising and became a friend of the Cypriote kings and many other men of note, at which time he abducted a girl of Athenian birth, daughter of Aristeides and his own niece, without the knowledge of her family, and sent her as <pb xml:id="v.10.p.359"/> a gift to the King of Cyprus. Then, when he was to be brought to trial for this, he stole her back again from Cyprus and was caught and put in prison by the king; but he ran away and came back to Athens at the time when the Four Hundred were in control of affairs. He was put in prison by them, but escaped, and again, when the oligarchy was overthrown, he <gap reason="lost" rend="..."/> was banished from the city after the Thirty had taken over the government. He spent the period of his exile in Elis, but when Thrasybulus and his band returned,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In the summer of 404 b.c. thirty men had been appointed to draw up laws and manage the state temporarily. Thrasybulus seized the hill-fortress of Phylê in December and maintained his position against two attacks by the Thirty. In May 403 Thrasybulus and his followers seized Peiraeus. In September the Thirty were overthrown and the democracy re-established.</note> he also returned to the city. He was sent to Lacedaemon to negotiate a peace, but was suspected of wrongdoing<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The nature of the accusation cannot be determined. See Blass, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Die attische Beredsamkeit</title>, 2nd ed., pp. 293 ff. The oration <title rend="italic">On the Peace</title>, delivered between 393 and 390 b.c., deals with the terms proposed by the mission in which Andocides participated.</note> and banished. He gives information about all this in the speeches which he wrote; for some of them he composed in his defence in the matter of the mysteries, and others when he was asking to be allowed to return home. There is also extant his speech <title rend="italic">On the Indictment</title>, also the Defence against Phaeax and the speech <title rend="italic">On the Peace</title>. He flourished at the same time as Socrates the philosopher; the date of his birth was the seventy-eighth Olympiad, when Theogenides was archon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">468-467 b.c. This date, however, is based upon a false reckoning, and from the orator’s own statements he could not have been born much before 440. See Blass, <foreign xml:lang="lat">ibid.</foreign> i. p. 283, and Kirchner, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Prosop.

The Hermes called the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.361"/> Hermes of Andocides is named after him. It is a dedication of the tribe Aegeis and is called Hermes of Andocides because Andocides lived near it.

He is simple and free from artifice in his orations, plain and employing no figures of speech. </p> </div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> <head><label>III.</label> LYSIAS</head> 
				<p rend="indent">Lysias was the son of Cephalus, grandson of Lysanias, and great-grandson of Cephalus. His father was by birth a Syracusan but moved to Athens because he wished to live in that city and also because Pericles, son of Xanthippus, persuaded him to do so, as he was a personal friend of Pericles and they were connected by ties of hospitality, and he was a man of great wealth. But some say that he moved because he was banished from Syracuse when Gelo was tyrant. Lysias was born at Athens in the archonship of the Philocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">459-458 b.c.</note> who succeeded Phrasicles,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The archon in 460-459 b.c. was Phrasicleides, not Phrasicles.</note> in the second year of the eightieth Olympiad, and at first he was a schoolmate of the most prominent Athenians; but when the city sent the colony to Sybaris, which was afterwards renamed Thurii, he went out with his eldest brother Polemarchus (for he had two others, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.363"/> Euthydemus and Brachyllus), their father being already dead, to share in the allotment of land.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The scene of Plato’s <title rend="italic">Republic</title> is laid at the house of Cephalus. The dialogue is not historical, and its imagined date cannot be fixed, but it seems to show that Plato knew Cephalus and his sons, see Blass, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Die attische Beredsamkeit</title>, 2nd ed., i. p. 341.</note> This was in the archonship of Praxiteles,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">444-443 b.c.</note> and he was then fifteen years old. He remained there, was instructed by the Syracusans Teisias and Nicias, acquired a house, had a share of the allotment, and was a citizen for thirty-three years, until Cleocritus was archon at Athens.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">413-412 b.c. The ninety-second Olympiad is the date of the archonship of another Callias, 406-405 b.c.</note> But in the next year, when Callias was archon,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The dates given by our author for events in the life of Lysias are consistent (see also 835 a above, and 836 f below, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Dion. Hal. <title rend="italic">Isocrates</title>, i.), on the assumption that he went to Thurii when the colony was founded, in 444 b.c. But if that is correct, his activity as a writer of speeches to be delivered in the Athenian courts would not begin until his fifty-seventh year. Blass, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Die attische Beredsamkeit</title>, 2nd ed., i. p. 345, after stating the evidence, comes to the conclusion that Lysias was born at Athens probably about 446 b.c., the only certain date being his age (fifteen years), when he went to Thurii, and his treutn to Athens in 413-412 b.c. or the year following. It is quite possible that he did not go to Thurii until some years after the foundation of the colony. The latest of his extant speeches may be dated about 380 b.c., so that we may believe that he died not long after that date.</note> in the ninety-second Olympiad, when the misfortunes in Sicily<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The great expedition which the Athenians had sent out in 415 b.c. expecting to conquer Sicily was utterly annihilated in the autumn of 413 b.c.</note> had happened to the Athenians and unrest had arisen among the allies in general and especially those who dwelt in Italy, he was accused of favouring Athens and, with three hundred others, was banished. Arriving at Athens in the archonship of the Callias<note resp="editor" place="unspeciifed" anchored="true">412-411 b.c.</note> who succeeded Cleocritus, when the Four Hundred already had possession of the city,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Summer of 411 b.c.</note> he remained <pb xml:id="v.10.p.365"/> there. But when the battle of Aegospotami<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">405 b.c.

He was deprived of his property and lost his brother Polemarchus, but he himself escaped from the house in which he was kept to be executed (for it had two doors)<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Lysias, xii. (<title rend="italic">Against Eratosthenes</title>) 15.</note> and lived at Megara.

<p rend="indent">Four hundred and twenty-five orations attributed to him are current. Of these Dionysius and Caecilius and their school say that two hundred and thirtythree are genuine, and he is said to have lost his case with only two of them. There is also his speech in support of the enactment against which Archinus brought suit and deprived him of citizenship, and another against the Thirty. He was very persuasive and concise and produced most of his speeches for private clients. There are also Textbooks of Rhetoric prepared by him, and Public Addresses, Letters and Eulogies, Funeral Speeches, Love Speeches, and a Defence of Socrates addressed to the judges.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cicero, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Oratore</title>, i. 231, and Diogenes Laertius, ii. 20, 40, say that Lysias composed an oration in defence of Socrates, and offered it to him, but Socrates refused it. A speech in defence of Socrates (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερ Σωκράτους πρὸς Πολυκράτην</foreign>) is mentioned several times by the scholiast on Aristeides. It was composed probably some years after the death of Socrates, as an epideictic oration in reply to a similar speech against Socrates by the sophist Polycrates.

Moreover Philiscus, a pupil of Isocrates and comrade of <pb xml:id="v.10.p.369"/> Lysias, composed an elegiac poem to him, from which it is plain that he was earlier in years, which is indicated also by what Plato said.

				<p rend="indent">Isocrates was the son of Theodorus of Erchia, a citizen of the middle class, an owner of slaves who made flutes, through whom he gained a competence, so that he paid for a public chorus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Wealthy Athenians performed in turn special services to the state called <q>liturgies.</q> The most expensive of these was the choregy, which involved the payment, training, and equipment of a chorus for a lyrical or dramatic performance.</note> and gave his children an education<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Isocrates, <title rend="italic">On the Exchange of Property</title> (Or. xv.), 161.</note> (for he had other sons, Telesippus and Diomnestus, and also a daughter), and hence he is ridiculed on account of the flutes by Aristophanes and Strattis. Isocrates was born in the eighty-sixth Olympiad, in the archonship of Lysimachus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">436-435 b.c.</note> of Myrrhinus, being twenty-two years younger than Lysias and seven years older than Plato.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato was born in 428-427 b.c. Lysias, according to this statement, in 459-458. But see note on 835 d above.</note> In his boyhood he was as well educated as any Athenian, for he attended the lectures of Prodicus of Ceos, Gorgias of Leontini, Teisias of Syracuse, and the orator Theramenes; and when the lastnamed was in danger of being arrested by the Thirty and had fled for safety to the altar of Hestia Boulaea,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The sanctuary of this Goddess of the Senate’s Hearth was in or near the Prytaneum, which was somewhere on the northern slope of the Acropolis.</note> everyone else was terrified, but Isocrates alone arose to speak in his aid; and at first he was silent for a long time, then afterwards he was urged to be silent by Theramenes himself, who said that his misfortune would be more painful if any of his friends should share it. And it is said that certain rhetorical teachings of Theramenes - those which go under the name of Boton - were of use to Isocrates when he was <pb xml:id="v.10.p.373"/> falsely accused in the courts. But when he became a man he kept away from political affairs, since he had a weak voice and a timid disposition<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Isocrates, <title rend="italic">Philip</title> (Or. v.), 81; <title rend="italic">Panathenaic</title> (Or. xii.), 9.</note> and had lost his inherited property in the war against the Lacedaemonians. It is evident that he composed speeches for others, but he delivered only one, that on the Exchange of Property. He set up a school and turned to philosophy and to writing out the results of his thinking, and he composed his Festival Oration<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">i.e.</foreign> the <title rend="italic">Panegyric</title>, delivered at Olympia.</note> and some others of an advisory nature, some of which he delivered himself and some of which he prepared for others to deliver, hoping that in this way he might lead the Greeks to think as they ought. But when he failed of his purpose he gave up that sort of thing and became the head of a school, at first, as some say, at Chios, where he had nine pupils. That was the time when, as he saw the tuition fees counted out, he burst into tears and said, <q>Now I recognize that I have sold myself to these people.</q> He would carry on conversation with all who desired it and was the first to make a distinction between contentious speeches and those of a political character, to which latter he devoted himself. And he also instituted at Chios public offices and the same constitution which existed in his native city. He made more money than any other sophist, so that he was even a trierarch.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The trierarchy was one of the <q>liturgies</q> which wealthy citizens were obliged to perform.

<p rend="indent">His pupils numbered about one hundred, including among many others Timotheüs, son of Conon, with <pb xml:id="v.10.p.375"/> whom he visited many cities; and he composed the letters which Timotheüs sent to the Athenians, on account of which Timotheüs presented him with a talent out of the sum remaining after the relief of Samos.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">365 b.c.</note> Pupils of his were also Theopompus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The text of Photius reads Xenophon the son of Gryllus and Theopompus.</note> of Chios, Ephorus of Cumae, Asclepiades who compiled the arguments of tragedies, and Theodectas of Phaselis, who afterwards wrote tragedies and whose monument stood as you go to the Bean-market along the Sacred Way which leads to Eleusis; it is now in ruins. There, too, were set up statues of the famous poets along with his; of these only the poet Homer exists now. And Leodamas the Athenian and Lacritus the Athenian law-maker and, as some say, Hypereides and Isaeus were his pupils. And they say that while he was still teaching oratory Demosthenes came to him eager to learn and said that he could not pay the thousand drachmas which he asked as tuition fee, but would give two hundred for one fifth of the instruction; whereupon Isocrates replied: <q>We do not cut our instruction into bits, Demosthenes, but just as people sell fine fish whole, so, if you wish to be my pupil, I will sell you my course whole.</q> </p>

When he was an old man he adopted <pb xml:id="v.10.p.379"/> Aphareus, the youngest of the three sons of Plathanê, daughter of the orator Hippias. He acquired ample wealth, for he not only collected money from his pupils, but he also received from Nicocles, king of Cyprus, who was the son of Evagoras, twenty talents for the oration written in his honour. On account of his wealth he was envied and was proposed three times as trierarch. Twice he alleged illness and was exempted by petitions presented by his son, but the third time he undertook the duty and spent no small sum. To a father who said that he gave his son only a slave as companion he said, <q>Go your ways, then, for you will have two slaves instead of one.</q> He took part also in the competition offered by Artemisia in honour of Maussolus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Mausolus, ruler of Halicarnassus, died in 353 b.c.

The remains of the sculpture include portrait statues of Maussolus and Artemisia and are among the most highly prized possessions of the British Museum.</note> but his Eulogy is not extant. He wrote also a Eulogy of Helen and a speech called the Areopagitic. He departed this life some say on the ninth day of his abstention from food, others on the fourth day at the time of the funeral of those who fell at Chaeroneia. His son Aphareus also wrote speeches. Isocrates was buried with his family near Cynosarges<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cynosarges was a region in Athens in which was a great gymnasium.</note> on the left side of the hill-he himself, his father Theodorus, and his mother; and her sister Anaco, the orator’s aunt, and his adopted son Aphareus, and his cousin Socrates, son of Anaco <pb xml:id="v.10.p.381"/> Isocrates’ mother’s sister, and his brother Theodorus who had the same name as his father, and his grandsons, the sons of his adopted son Aphareus, Aphareus and his father Theodorus, and the latter’s wife Plathanê, mother of the adopted son Aphareus. And over them there were six tablets which do not now exist. On the monument of Isocrates himself was a column thirty cubits high, on which was a siren seven cubits high as a symbol; but this exists no longer. There was also a tablet near by with poets and his instructors on it, among whom was Gorgias gazing into an astrological sphere and Isocrates standing beside him. There is also a bronze statue of him, dedicated by Timotheüs, son of Conon, at Eleusis in front of the vestibule. It bears this inscription: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Here to the goddesses twain Timotheüs giveth this statue </l> <l>Tribute to friend and to sage, image of Isocrates.</l> </quote> It is a work of Leochares. </p> 
<p rend="indent">Sixty orations are current under his name, of which twenty-five are genuine according to Dionysius, twenty-eight according to Caecilius, and the rest are spurious. He was averse to public declamation, so much so that once, when three persons came to hear him, he retained two but let the third go, telling him to come the next day, since now the lecture-room had a full audience. And he used to say to his pupils that he himself gave instruction for ten minas, but would give ten thousand to anyone who would teach him self-confidence and a pleasant voice. And when he <pb xml:id="v.10.p.383"/> was asked how he, not being a good speaker himself, could make others so, he replied that whetstones cannot themselves cut, but make iron fit to do so. Some say that he also wrote textbooks of oratory, others that in his teaching he made use of practice, not of method. He never demanded a fee from a fellow-citizen. When his pupils went to meetings of the assembly, he told them to report to him what was said there. He was greatly grieved by the death of Socrates, and the next day he appeared in black clothing. And again, when someone asked him <q>What is oratory?</q> he said, <q>the art of making small things great and great things small.</q> And once when he was a guest at a banquet in the house of Nicocreon, despot of Cyprus, and some of those present urged him to discourse, he said, <q>for subjects in which I am competent this is not the time; in the subjects for which this is the time I am not competent.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. </foreign><title rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 613 a.</note> When he saw the tragic poet Sophocles amorously following a boy, he said, <q>Sophocles, we must not only keep our hands to ourselves, but our eyes as well.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Attributed to Pericles by Plutarch, <title rend="italic">Life of Pericles</title>, chap. viii., and Cicero, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Officiis</title>, i. 40. 144.</note> And when Ephorus of Cumae had left his school without learning anything and had been sent back by his father with a second tuition-fee, he called him in fun Diphorus (Twice-bringer); he took, however, great pains with him and even suggested to him the subject of his work.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The great work of Ephorus was a history of the world (primarily of Greece) from the return of the Heracleidae to the siege of Perinthus in 340 b.c.

Demosthenes attacks Aeschines and his colleagues.</note> For this he was accused by Demosthenes of having destroyed the Phocian nation and moreover of having stirred up war between the Amphissians, who were building the harbour when he was chosen as delegate to the Amphictyonic Council, and the Amphictyons; as a result of which the Amphictyons turned to Philip for protection, and he, assisted by Aeschines, took matters in hand and conquered Phocis. But through the aid of Eubulus, son of Spintharus, of the deme of Probalinthus, who had influence with the people, he was acquitted by thirty votes; but some say that though the orators composed their speeches, yet <pb xml:id="v.10.p.393"/> the suit never came to trial because the battle of Chaeroneia intervened.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The author’s extreme brevity reduces to two sentences the events of about eight years. The acquittal of Aeschines took place in 343 b.c.</note> At a later time, when Philip was dead and Alexander was crossing over to Asia, he brought a suit against Ctesiphon for illegal conduct in proposing the honours for Demosthenes; and when he did not receive one-fifth of the votes cast, he went into exile at Rhodes, not being willing to pay a fine of a thousand drachmas for his defeat.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Anyone who brought a suit against another for proposing a measure forbidden by law was subject to a fine and was debarred from bringing any similar suit if he received less than one-fifth of the votes cast by the dicasts.</note> But some say that he was further punished by disfranchisement and did not leave the city of his own accord, and that he went to Alexander at Ephesus. During the confusion following Alexander’s death he sailed to Rhodes, set up a school there, and taught. He read to the Rhodians his oration against Ctesiphon as an exhibition of his powers, and when they all wondered that after delivering that speech he had lost his case, <q>You would not wonder, Rhodians,</q> he said, <q>if you had heard Demosthenes speak in reply to it.</q> And he left a school behind him there, called the Rhodian school. Then he sailed to Samos and not long after, while lingering on that island, died. He had an excellent voice, as is clear from what Demosthenes says<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Demosthenes, xviii. (<title rend="italic">On the Crown</title>) 259, 308.</note> and from the oration of Demochares. </p>

				<p rend="indent"> Lycurgus was the son of Lycophron and grandson of the Lycurgus whom the Thirty Tyrants put to death, his execution being brought about by Aristodemus <pb xml:id="v.10.p.397"/> of Batê, who also, after having been one of the Hellenotamiae,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Hellenotamiae were a board of ten members who collected and administered the tribute paid to Athens by the members of the Delian Confederacy.</note> was banished under the democracy. Lycurgus was of the deme of the Butadae and the family of the Eteobutadae. He attended the lectures of Plato the philosopher and at first devoted himself to philosophy; then, after being a pupil of the orator Isocrates, he had a notable public career both as a speaker and as a man of action, and he was also entrusted with the management of the finances of the State; for he was made treasurer for three periods of four years<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">338-326 b.c. The title of his office is not known. No regular office so extensive as this is mentioned in Aristotle’s <title rend="italic">Constitution of Athens</title>. He may have been in charge of the theoric fund or the military fund, or both, by virtue of a special commission, which in the next generation became a regular office; see Ferguson, <title rend="italic">Hellenistic Athens</title>, p. 10, Tarn, <title rend="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</title>, vi. p. 441. The period meant may be the quinquennium.</note> in charge of fourteen thousand talents, or, as some say (and among them the man who proposed the vote of honours for him,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Decree III, below, 852.</note> Stratocles the orator), eighteen thousand, six hundred and fifty.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Roughly equivalent to £3,026,000 or $15,130,000, or more at present values.</note> He was elected in his own person the first time, but afterwards he entered the name of one of his friends, though he himself administered the office, because a law had previously been introduced forbidding anyone elected treasurer of the public funds to hold the office more than four years; and he was always intent upon the public business summer and winter. When he was elected to provide munitions of war he restored many edifices in the city, he provided four hundred triremes for the people, he constructed the gymnasium in the Lyceum and planted trees in it, he built the palaestra and finished the Dionysiac theatre when he was the commissioner in charge of that work.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Probably while he was in control of the finances. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Dörpfeld and Reisch, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Das griechische Theater</title>, pp. 39 f.</note> He took care of two hundred <pb xml:id="v.10.p.399"/> and fifty talents entrusted to him on deposit by private persons, he provided for the city objects of gold and silver for use in processions and golden Victories, and many buildings which came into his hands half-finished he completed, among them the ship-sheds and the arsenal. And he put the foundation-walls round the Panathenaic stadium. This he accomplished, and also the levelling of the ravine, because a certain Deinias who owned this plot of land gave it to the city when Lycurgus suggested to him that he make the gift. </p> 
<p rend="indent">He was charged also with guarding the city and arresting malefactors, whom he drove out entirely, so that some of the sophists said that Lycurgus signed warrants against evil-doers with a pen dipped, not in ink, but in death. And therefore, when King Alexander demanded his surrender, the people did not give him up. When Philip was carrying on the second war with the Athenians, Lycurgus went as envoy with Polyeuctus and Demosthenes to the Peloponnesus and to some other States. Throughout his life he was always highly esteemed among the Athenians and considered a just man, so that in the courts of law the word of Lycurgus was regarded as a help to anyone requiring an advocate. </p> 
<p rend="indent">He also introduced laws: the law relating to comic actors, that a competitive performance be held on the festival of Pots<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The third day of the Anthesteria, the thirteenth day of the month Anthesterium.</note> and that the victor’s name <pb xml:id="v.10.p.401"/> be inscribed as eligible for the City Dionysia,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραγῳδοὶ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμῳδοὶ</foreign> alone were eligible to be chosen by lot as protagonists for the tragedies and comedies to be presented at the City Dionysia, the subordinate roles being assigned to plain <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποκριταί</foreign>. Prior to the passage of the law of Lycurgus those only were eligible who had previously won a victory at the City Dionysia. The effect of the law of Lycurgus was, therefore, to increase the number of thos efrom whom the archon could choose a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμῳδός</foreign> for each of the five comedies to be presented. See Rohde, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Rheinisches Museum</title>, xxxviii. p. 276, and J. B. O’Connor, <title rend="italic">Chapters in the History of Actors and Acting</title>, pp. 57 ff.</note> which had not been permitted before, and thus he revived a contest which had fallen out of use; the law that bronze statues of the poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides be erected, that their tragedies be written out and kept in a public depository, and that the clerk of the State read them to the actors who were to perform their plays for comparison of the texts and that it be unlawful to depart from the authorized text in acting; a third law that no Athenian or foreign resident of Athens should be permitted to buy from among captives a person of free birth to be a slave without the consent of his former master<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Prisoners of war were usually auctioned off into slavery regardless of their previous condition.

H.

His own wife disobeyed, the informers caught her in the act, and he gave them a talent; and at a later time, wrhen accused of this in the popular assembly, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.403"/> he said, <q>At any rate I am found to have been the giver, not the receiver.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The story may well be apocryphal. The saying of Lycurgus, repeated by Plutarch in his <title rend="italic">Comp. of Nicias and Crassus</title>, 3, is not there connected with the Eleusis incident; and Aelian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Var. Hist.</title> xiii. 24, expressly states that the statesman’s wife paid a fine after legal condemnation, not a bribe to the informer.</note> And once when a taxcollector laid hands on Xenocrates the philosopher and Lycurgus met him as he was leading him away to enforce payment of his tax as a resident alien,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The tax was twelve drachmas.</note> he brought his walking-stick down on the tax-collector’s head, set Xenocrates free, and shut the other man up in prison for improper conduct. As he was generally commended for his act, Xenocrates, happening to meet Lycurgus’s children some days later, said <q>I have repaid your father quickly for the favour he did me, boys; for he is widely commended for coming to my assistance.</q> </p> 
<p rend="indent">He also proposed decrees,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Several decrees moved by him are extant,<foreign xml:lang="lat"> e.g.</foreign> <title rend="italic"> I.G.</title> ii.² 337, 338.</note> making use of a certain Olynthian named Eucleides, who was an expert in decrees. And although he was well-to-do, he wore one and the same cloak winter and summer and put on sandals only on days when they wTere necessary. He studied night and day, since he had no natural gift for extemporaneous speaking, and he lay on a cot with only a sheepskin and a pillow on it, so that he might wake up easily and study. When someone found fault with him for paying money to sophists although he made words his profession, he replied that if anyone would promise to make his sons better, he would pay him, not thousands only, but half his property. He was an outspoken speaker on account of his good birth. Once, indeed, when the Athenians <pb xml:id="v.10.p.405"/> were showing dissent as he was speaking, he burst out with: <q>O Corcyraean whip, how ma ly talents you are worth!</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Corcyraean whip was especially stinging, and the orator’s outbreak means: <q>I would give a great deal to use a cat-o’-nine-tails on you people.</q> </note> And when they were proclaiming Alexander a god, <q>What sort of god,</q> he said, <q>is he when those who <emph>come out</emph> of his temple have to sprinkle themselves with holy water?</q> After his death his sons were handed over to the eleven executioners on the accusation of Menesaechmus, the indictment being written by Thrasycles; but when Demosthenes, who was at that time in exile, wrote a letter to the Athenians<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Demosthenes, <title rend="italic">Epistle</title> iii., and Aeschines, <title rend="italic">Epistle</title> xii. 14.</note> saying that their reputation was suffering because of Lycurgus’s sons, they changed their mind and released them, Democles, a pupil of Theophrastus, speaking in their defence. He himself and some of his descendants were buried at public expense; and their monuments are opposite the Paeonian Athena in the garden of the philosopher Melanthius<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Judeich, <title rend="italic">Topogr. v. Athen</title> ², p. 409, conjectures that the garden of Melanthius was in the neighbourhood of the Academy.</note>; they are in the form of tables, and those of Lycurgus and his children have inscriptions and are still preserved in our day. His greatest achievement was the raising of the State revenue to twelve hundred talents when it had previously been sixty. When he was at the point of death he gave orders that he be carried to the temple of the Great Mother and into the Bouleuterion,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Bouleuterion was the meeting-place of the Boulê or Senate; the foundations of this and of the temple of the Great Mother have recently been found on the west side of the Agora.

He never was convicted, though many brought accusations against him. </p> 
<p rend="indent">He had three children by Callisto, the daughter of Habron and sister of Callias the son of Habron of the deme Batê, the one who was treasurer of military funds in the archonship of Charondas.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">338-337 b.c.</note> Deinarchus, in his speech against Pistius, tells about this connexion by marriage. He left three sons, Habron, Lycurgus, and Lycophron, of whom Habron and Lycurgus died without issue. However, Habron at any rate had a distinguished public career before he died; but Lycophron married Callistomachê, daughter of Philippus of Aexonê, and had a daughter Callisto. She was married to Cleombrotus of Acharnae, son of Deinocrates, to whom she bore a son Lycophron, who was adopted by his grandfather Lycophron and died without issue. After Lycophron’s death Socrates married Callisto and had a son Symmachus. Symmachus had a son Aristonymus, he a son Charmides, and Charmides a daughter Philippa. Her son by Lysander was Medeius, who became an expounder of rites,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">At Eleusis in connexion with the Eleusinian Mysteries.</note> being of the family of the Eumolpidae. He and Timothea, daughter of Glaucus, had three children, Laodameia and Medeius, who held the priestship of Poseidon-Erechtheus, and Philippa, who afterwards became priestess of Athena; but before that Diocles of Melitê married her, and their son was the Diocles who was general in command of the heavy-armed force.

<p rend="indent">Fifteen speeches of the orator are current.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Of these only the speech against Leocrates has come down to us.</note> He was crowned by the people many times and was honoured with statues.

After Lycurgus died his eldest son, Lycophron, brought a suit for the grant. Lycurgus spoke also many times on religious matters, bringing suit against Autolycus the Areopagite, Lysicles the general, Demades the son of Demeas, Menesaechmus, and many others, and he caused them all to be convicted. He also brought Diphilus to trial, who removed from the silver mines the rock props which supported the weight above and made himself rich from them contrary to the law; and though the penalty for this was death, Lycurgus brought about his conviction, and from the confiscated estate distributed fifty drachmas to every citizen, since the total sum collected was one hundred and sixty talents or, as some say, he distributed a mina to each <pb xml:id="v.10.p.411"/> citizen.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The drachma was worth, in silver, about 9d. or 18 cents, the mina 100 drachmas, the talent 60 minas.

But the tablet was put up by his son Habron, who received the priesthood by inheritance and handed it over to his brother Lycophron; and that is why Habron is represented as handing Lycophron the trident. And Lycurgus had a record made of all his acts as a public official and set it up on a tablet, for all men to see who wished, in front of the palaestra that he had built; no one, however, could convict him of embezzlement.

He imitated Thucydides and also the philosopher Plato, whose instruction, some say, he followed with especial zeal.

They say, too, that as he progressed in his ability to speak he had a mirror made as large as himself and kept his eyes on it while practising, that he might correct his faults; and that he used to go down to the shore at Phalerum and address his remarks to the roar of the waves, that he might not be disconcerted if the people should ever make a disturbance; and that because he was short of breath he paid Neoptolemus the actor ten thousand drachmas to teach him to speak whole paragraphs without taking breath. </p> 
<p rend="indent">And when he entered upon political life, finding that the public men of the city were divided into two parties, one favouring Philip and the other addressing the populace in defence of liberty, he enrolled himself among those opposed to Philip and always constantly advised the people to support the cause of those peoples which were in danger of being subjected by Philip, in which policy he was associated with Hypereides, Nausicles, Polyeuctus, and Diotimus; and thus he also brought the Thebans, Euboeans, Corcyraeans, Corinthians, Boeotians, and many others into alliance with the Athenians.

For this also he often provoked a clamour from the audience. But by going to school to Eubulides the Milesian philosopher he corrected all his faults. Once when he was at the Olympic festival and heard Lamachus of Tereina reading a eulogy of Philip and Alexander fand decrying the Thebans and Olynthians, he stood up and quoted the words of the ancient poets testifying to the glorious deeds of the Thebans and Olynthians, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.421"/> with the result that Lamachus was silenced and fled from the festival. And Philip said to those who reported to him the public speeches of Demosthenes against him, <q>I myself, if I had heard Demosthenes speak, would have elected the man general to carry on the war against me.</q> And Philip used to say that Demosthenes’ speeches were like soldiers because of their warlike power, but those of Isocrates were like athletes, because they afforded pleasure like that of a show. </p>

Aeschines received less than one-fifth of the votes of the dicasts, and was therefore condemned to pay a fine of 1000 drachmas and to forfeit the right to bring any similar suit.</note> he followed him on horseback, and Aeschines, thinking he was arresting him, fell at his feet and covered his head, but Demosthenes raised him up, encouraged him, and gave him a talent of silver. And he advised the people to support a force <pb xml:id="v.10.p.423"/> of mercenaries at Thasos, and sailed out as commander of a trireme on that occasion. After he had been in charge of the food supply he was accused of embezzlement but was acquitted.

<p rend="indent">And at a later time, when Alexander was campaigning in Asia and Harpalus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Harpalus, treasurer of Alexander, embezzled a large sum and fled first to Tarsus, then, in 324 b.c., to Greece.</note> came fleeing to Athens <pb xml:id="v.10.p.425"/> with money, at first Demosthenes kept him from being admitted, but after he had entered the harbour, Demosthenes accepted one thousand darics and changed his attitude, and when the Athenians wished to surrender the man to Antipater, he spoke against it and made a motion that Harpalus deposit the money on the Acropolis without even stating the amount to the people; and although Harpalus stated that he had brought with him seven hundred talents, that which was taken up to the Acropolis was found to amount to only three hundred and fifty or a little more, as Philochorus says. And after this, when Harpalus escaped from the prison in which he was being kept until a representative of Alexander should arrive, and had gone to Crete or, as some say, to Taenarum in Laconia, Demosthenes was accused of bribe-taking and of having this reason for not mentioning the amount of the money taken up or the carelessness of the guard. He was brought to trial by Hypereides, Pytheas, Menesaechmus, Himeraeus, and Patrocles, and they obtained his conviction by the Senate of the Areopagus; and after his conviction he went into exile, not being able to pay back five times the amount (he was accused of having accepted thirty talents), or, as some say, he did not wait for the trial. After this time the Athenians sent Polyeuctus as envoy to the commonwealth of the Arcadians in order to detach them from their alliance with the Macedonians, and when Polyeuctus was unable to persuade them, Demosthenes appeared to help him and did persuade them. For this he was admired, and after some time he was permitted to return, a decree in his favour having been passed <pb xml:id="v.10.p.427"/> and a trireme dispatched to bring him. When the Athenians passed a decree proposed by his cousin Demon of Paeania that he should use the thirty talents which he owed in adorning the altar of Zeus the Saviour at Peiraeus and should then be absolved, he returned on those conditions to public life. </p> 
<p rend="indent">When Antipater was shut up in Lamia by the Greeks, and the Athenians were making thankofferings for the good news, he said to his friend Agesistratus that he did not agree with the rest about these matters, <q>for,</q> he said, <q>I know that the Greeks have both the knowledge and the strength for a stadium dash<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A stadium was about equal to a furlong and was the usual short-distance run.

There are those who say that he died by holding his breath, but others assert that it was by sucking poison from his seal ring. He lived, according to those who give the higher number, seventy years, according to those who giye the lower, sixty-seven. He was active in politics twenty-two years. <pb xml:id="v.10.p.431"/> </p> 
<p rend="indent">When Philip died,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">336 b.c.</note> Demosthenes came out from his house dressed in a white garment, in spite of the fact that his daughter had lately died, thus showing his joy at the death of the Macedonian.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See <title rend="italic">Life of Demosthenes</title>, chap. xxii.</note> He also assisted the Thebans when they were at war with Alexander, and he always encouraged the rest of the Greeks; for which reason Alexander after razing Thebes demanded him of the Athenians and threatened them if they should refuse to surrender him. And when Alexander was making war on the Persians and called upon the Athenians for a naval force, he spoke against it, saying that it was not clear whether Alexander would not employ the force against those who furnished it. </p> 
<p rend="indent">He left two sons by one wife of noble family, daughter of a certain Heliodorus; and he had one daughter who died unmarried while still a child. He had also a sister to whom and her husband Laches of Leuconoë his nephew Demochares was born, a man both brave in war and inferior to none in political speeches.

<p rend="indent">Sixty-five genuine speeches of Demosthenes are current. Some say that he lived a dissolute life, wearing women’s clothes and indulging in revels on every occasion, on which account he was nicknamed Batalus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aeschines, i.

The nickname is also said to refer to his stammering.</note>; but others say that this was a diminutive derived from the name of his nurse and was given to him in reproach. And Diogenes the Cynic, seeing him once in a tavern looking ashamed and trying to withdraw from sight, said, <q>The more you withdraw, the more you will be in the tavern.</q> And he jeered at him, saying that in his speeches he was a Scythian, but in battle a city man. He received money from Ephialtes also, one of the politicians, who had been on an embassy to the King of Persia and came secretly bringing funds for distribution among the politicians for the purpose of stirring up the war against Philip; and they say that he received a private bribe of three thousand darics from the King. He arrested a certain Anaxilas of Oreus, who had been a guest-friend of his, subjected him to torture as a spy, and when he confessed nothing proposed a decree <pb xml:id="v.10.p.435"/> that he be handed over to the executioners. And once when he was being prevented by the Athenians from speaking in the assembly, he said that he only wished to speak briefly to them, and when they became silent he said, <q>A young man in the summer time hired an ass to go from the city to Megara. When noon came and the sun was blazing fiercely, both he and the owner of the ass wished to lie down in its shadow.

After being a pupil of the philosopher Plato, along with Lycurgus, and of the orator Isocrates, Hypereides entered upon public life at Athens at the time when Alexander was interfering in the affairs of Greece. And he spoke in opposition to him concerning the generals whose surrender he demanded of the Athenians and concerning the triremes. He also advised against disbanding the mercenary force at Taenarum under the command of Chares, since he was well disposed towards that general. At first he pleaded in suits at law in return for a fee. And since he was believed to have shared the Persian funds<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The comic poets of the time were very free with such insinuations, <foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign> Timocles in his <title rend="italic">Delos</title> (Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com.

He also proposed honours for Demosthenes, and when suit was brought by Diondas on the ground that the decree was contrary to law, he was acquitted. Although he was a friend of Demosthenes, Lysicles, Lycurgus, and their associates, he did not remain so to the end; but when Lysicles and Lycurgus were dead and Demosthenes was being tried for receiving bribes from Harpalus, he was chosen from all the orators (for he alone was unbribed) and brought the accusation against him. And when he was brought to trial by Aristogeiton for illegal conduct in proposing a decree after the battle of Chaeroneia to grant citizenship to the resident aliens, to set the slaves free, and to put the sacred objects, the children, and the women in Peiraeus for safekeeping, he was acquitted. And when certain persons blame d him for having disregarded many laws in his decree, he said, <q>The shields of the Macedonians cast a shadow<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The shadow of the shields made him fail to see the laws (taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">παριδόντα</foreign> literally).</note> over my eyes,</q> and <q>It was not I, but the battle of Chaeroneia, that proposed the decree.</q> After this, however, Philip was frightened and granted permission to remove the bodies of the slain, though before that he had refused it to the heralds who came from Lebadeia. Later, however, after the battle of Crannon,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">After the death of Alexander the Great the Greeks revolted, but they lacked leadership, and when they were defeated in an engagement at Crannon, Thessaly, in August 322 b.c., the Greek states came to terms separately with Antipater.</note> when his surrender was demanded by Antipater and the people was on the point of surrendering him, he fled from the city to Aegina along with those against whom decrees had been passed.

And when envoys came from Antipater and praised their sender as a good man, in replying to them he said, <q>We know that he is good, but we do not want a good master.</q> It is said that in addressing the public he did not employ the actor’s art, that he merely related the facts of the case and did not bore the jurors even with these. He was sent also to the Eleans to defend the athlete Callippus against the charge of having used corruption in the contest, and he won his case; but when he brought a suit against the grant of a gift for Phocion, which Meidias, son of Meidias, of the deme Anagyros, proposed in the archonship of Xenias,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">An archon Xenias is unknown. Euxenippus, suggested by Schafer, was archon in 305-304 b.c., but Hypereides was then dead.

				<p rend="indent"> Deinarchus, son of Socrates or Sostratus, an Athenian according to some, but, as others think, a Corinthian, came to Athens while still young at the time when Alexander was invading Asia,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">334-323 b.c.</note> settled there, and became a pupil of Theophrastus, who had succeeded Aristotle as head of his School<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Lyceum, <foreign xml:lang="lat">i.e.</foreign> the Peripatetic School.</note>; but he also attended the lectures of Demetrius of Phalerum. He took part most actively in public affairs after the death of Antipater,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">318 b.c.</note> since some of the public men had been put to death and the rest were in exile. Since he became a friend of Cassander he prospered exceedingly through the fees he charged for the speeches which he wrote for those who requested his services; and he had as his opponents the most distinguished public men, although he did not speak before the popular assembly (for he was unable to do so<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">If he was a Corinthian by birth, he would be debarred from such speaking.</note>); but he merely wrote speeches for their opponents. And when Harpalus absconded he composed many speeches against those who were accused of having accepted bribes from him, and these he furnished to their accusers. But at a later time he was accused of having dealings with Antipater and Cassander in connexion with their occupation of Munichia when it was garrisoned by Antigonus and Demetrius in the archonship of Anaxicrates,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">307-306 b.c.</note> whereupon he turned most of his property into cash and went into exile at Chalcis. And after living in exile about fifteen years and amassing considerable wealth, he returned, his restoration, and at the same time <pb xml:id="v.10.p.449"/> that of the other exiles, having been effected by Theophrastus and his friends. He lodged at the house of a friend of his named Proxenus and lost his money, when he was already an old man and his eyes were weak, and when Proxenus refused to investigate the matter<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Evidently Deinarchus suspected theft or fraud.</note> he brought a suit against him, and then for the first time he spoke in a court of law. His speech is extant, too.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Only a fragment of this speech is extant.</note> There are sixty-four speeches of his extant which are regarded as genuine; of these some are handed down as by Aristogeiton. He was a zealous follower of Hypereides or, as some say on account of his emotional and vehement qualities, of Demosthenes. He certainly is an imitator of the latter’s figures of speech. </p> </div>

And after the battle of Chaeroneia he contributed a talent, and in the scarcity of food he contributed a talent for the food-supply. And because, through persuasion, benefactions, and the advice by which he moved them, he brought into alliance with the people the Thebans, Euboeans, Corinthians, Megarians, Achaeans, Locrians, Byzantines, and Messenians and gained troops for the people and its allies, namely ten thousand foot, one thousand horse, and a contribution of money which he as envoy persuaded the allies to give for the war - more than five hundred talents - and because he prevented the Peloponnesians from going to the aid of the Boeotians, giving money and going in person as envoy. And he advised the people to adopt many other excellent measures, and of all his contemporaries he performed the best public actions in the cause of liberty and democracy. And having been exiled by the oligarchy when the democracy had been destroyed, and having died at Calauria on account of his devotion to the democracy, when soldiers were sent against him by Antipater, persisting in his loyalty and devotion to the democracy and neither surrendering to its enemies nor doing anything in his time of danger that was unworthy of the democracy. </p> </div>

He won the assent of the people to all these measures and accomplished them; he was exiled for the sake of the democracy, he took no part in any oligarchy, he held no office after the democracy had been overthrown, and he was the only Athenian of those who were engaged in public life in his time who never plotted to alter the government of the country by changing it to a form other than democracy; he made the decisions of the courts, the laws, the courts, and property, safe for all Athenians by the policy he pursued, and he never did anything adverse to the democracy by word or deed. </p> </div>

				<p rend="indent">Lycophron, son of Lycurgus, of the deme Butadae, presented in writing a claim for maintenance in the Prytaneum for himself in accordance with the gift presented by the people to Lycurgus of the deme Butadae. In the archonship of Anaxicrates,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">307-306 b.c. Much of the substance of this document is contained in the <title rend="italic">Life of Lycurgus</title>, see pp. 395 ff. above.</note> in the sixth prytany, that of the tribe Antiochis, Stratocles, son of Euthydemus, of the deme Diomeia, made the following motion: Whereas Lycurgus, son of Lycophron, of the deme Butadae, having inherited from early times from his ancestors that loyalty to the democracy which has been peculiar to his family, and the progenitors of Lycurgus, Lycomedes and Lycurgus, were not only honoured by the people during their lives, but also after their death the people granted them for their courage and virtue public burials in the Cerameicus; and whereas Lycurgus himself during his public career made many excellent laws for his country, and when he was treasurer of the public revenues of the city for three periods of four years distributed from the public revenue eighteen thousand nine hundred talents; and having received in trust large funds from private citizens, from which he made loans previously agreed upon in order to meet the exigencies of the city and the people, in all six hundred and fifty talents; and, because he was believed to have administered all these funds justly, was often crowned by the State; and whereas when chosen by the people he brought together large sums of money upon the Acropolis, providing adornment for the Goddess, solid gold Victories, gold and silver vessels for the processions, and ornaments of gold for one hundred basket-carriers,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Maidens of good birth who carried baskets of offerings in the processions.</note> and when chosen to be in charge of the equipment for the war he brought to the Acropolis many pieces of armour and fifty thousand missiles and fitted out four hundred triremes ready to set sail, providing the equipment for some of them and causing some to be built from the beginning; <pb xml:id="v.10.p.457"/> and besides all this he finished the ship-sheds and the arsenal, which were half done when they came into his hands, and completed the Panathenaic stadium and erected the gymnasium at the Lyceum, and adorned the city with many other edifices. And when King Alexander, after overthrowing all Asia, assumed to give orders to all the Greeks in common and demanded that Lycurgus be surrendered because he was acting in opposition to him, the city did not surrender him in spite of fear of Alexander. And although he had many times submitted his accounts while the city was free and had a democratic form of government, he never was convicted of wrongdoing or of taking bribes through all his career. Therefore, that all may know that those who choose to act justly in public life in behalf of democracy and freedom are held in the highest esteem while living and receive after death enduring gratitude: With good Fortune: Be it resolved by the people to commend Lycurgus, son of Lycophron, of the deme Butadae, for his virtue and justice, and to set up a bronze statue of him in the Market-place, only not in any place where the law forbids its erection, and to grant maintenance in the Prytaneum to the eldest descendant of Lycurgus for all time, and that all his decrees be valid, and that the secretary of the people inscribe them on stone tablets arid place them on the Acropolis near the dedicatory offerings; and that the treasurer of the people give for inscribing the tablets fifty drachmas from the funds expended by the people for decrees. </p> </div>
