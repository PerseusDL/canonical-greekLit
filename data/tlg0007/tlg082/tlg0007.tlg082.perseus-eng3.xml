<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> 
<p rend="indent">Plutarch was an admirer of the old Spartan virtues, and it seems altogether probable that the collection of sayings of Spartans was made by him as literary material for use in his writing, as he tells us was his custom (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 457 d and 464 f), and many of the sayings are actually found incorporated in his other works. That he did not use all the material which he had accumulated is no more than is to be expected from a discriminating author.</p> 
<p rend="indent">The title (<title rend="italic">Sayings of Spartans</title>) stands as No. 169 in Lamprias’s list of Plutarch’s works.</p> 
<p rend="indent">A selection from the sayings of the more famous Spartans is incorporated in the <title rend="italic">Sayings of Kings and Commanders</title>, which covers a broader field, including both Greeks and Romans, and so does not contain the entire collection of Spartan sayings. For example, in the <title rend="italic">Spartan Sayings</title>, under the name of Agesilaus are found seventy-nine different sayings, but only twelve of these are selected for inclusion in the <title rend="italic">Sayings of Kings and Commanders</title>, so that the Emperor Trajan (if the collection was made for him) should not. be overburdened in his reading!</p> 
<p rend="indent">The ms. tradition of these Spartan sayings is in sad confusion. The Spartans spoke in the Doric dialect, yet according to the ms. tradition of Plutarch they spoke sometimes Doric, more often Attic, and <pb xml:id="v.3.p.241"/> occasionally used Aeolie forms i It is not likely, for example, that the mother of Brasidas spoke Doric (190 c) and Attic (219 d) in making the same remark, or that Brasidas spoke sometimes Doric and sometimes Attic (219 c-d), or that Charillus said the same thing in both Doric (189 f) and Attic (232 c). The explanation probably is that Plutarch copied these anecdotes as he found them in the books from which he made his excerpts. Xenophon, for example, or Thucydides seldom uses Doric, but represents the Spartans as speaking Attic, as frankly as Herodotus or Aeschylus represents the Persians as spealdng Greek. So on the stage in England or America, or in novels, French or German characters speak English, or <foreign xml:lang="lat">vice versa</foreign>-a convention which is universally accepted. Hence it should not disturb us to find Plutarch recording remarks of Spartans in the Attic dialect, nor should we hastily conclude that the mss. are all wrong.</p> 
<p rend="indent">It would be possible, with our present knowledge, to translate all these Spartan sayings into the Doric dialect, but to do so would be a useless <foreign xml:lang="fre">tour deforce</foreign>. It would be as if the editor of a newspaper were to insist that every story about a Scotchman or a Yankee should be edited to conform to the correct Scotch or Yankee dialect-a rather futile proceeding. Hence no radical changes have been made in the ms. tradition. Only when the mss. show a distinct attempt to quote in Doric has an effort been made to make the Doric consistent in itself.</p> 
<p rend="indent">It will not escape the attentive reader that the names of the Spartans whose sayings are quoted are arranged in alphabetical order, for the purpose, without doubt, of facilitating reference to them.</p> </div> </div> <pb xml:id="v.3.p.243"/>

<p rend="indent">Agesilaus the Great was once chosen by lot to be master of ceremonies at an evening party, and, when he was asked by the slave who poured the wine how much wine he should serve to each man, Agesilaus said, <q>If much wine has been provided, as much as each one asks for; but if only a little, then give to all equally.</q> </p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> 
<p rend="indent">When someone said to him, <q>You have agreed,</q> and kept repeating the same thing, Agesilaus said, <q>Yes, of course, if it is right; but if not, then I said so, but I did not agree.</q> And when the other added, <q>But surely kings ought to carry out <q> whatsoe’er they confirm by the royal assent,</q></q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Adapted from Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> i. 527.</note> Agesilaus said, <q>No more than those who approach kings ought to ask for what is right and say what is right, trying to hit upon the right occasion and a request fitting for kings to grant.</q> </p> </div>

<p rend="indent">At another time he saw a mouse being dragged from a hole by a boy who had hold of him, and the mouse turned and bit the hand that held him and escaped; whereupon Agesilaus called the attention of the bystanders to this, and said, <q>When the smallest animal thus defends itself against those who do it wrong, consider what it becomes men to do.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the similar story about Brasidas in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 79 E, 190 B, and 219 C.</note> </p> </div>

<p rend="indent">Desiring to bring about the war against the Persian for the sake of setting free the Greeks living in Asia, he consulted the oracle of Zeus at Dodona, and when the god bade him to go on, he reported the answer to the Ephors. And they bade him go to Delphi and ask the same question. Accordingly he proceeded to the prophetic shrine and put his question in this form: <q>Apollo, are you of the same opinion as your father?</q> And Apollo concurring, Agesilaus was chosen, and began the campaign. <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 191 B, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and the note.</note> </p> </div>

Agesilaus gladly welcomed the transgression, and set forth as if he were intending to advance into Cari a; and when Tissaphernes had concentrated his forces there, Agesilaus, by a rapid movement thence, invaded Phrygia; and having taken very many cities and a wealth of spoil, he said to his friends, <q>To do wrong after making a treaty is impious, but to outwit the enemy is not only right and reputable, but also pleasant and profitable.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch’s <title rend="italic">Life of Agesilaus</title>, chap. ix.

And when the boy stopped coming to see him, Agesilaus asked for him; whereupon his friends said that he had only himself to blame, because he shrank from coming within kissing distance of the fair one, and if he would not act the coward, the boy would come again. Agesilaus, reflecting by himself for no brief time in uninterrupted silence, finally said, <q>There is no need of our trying to persuade him; for I feel that I had rather be above such things than to take by storm the most populous city of our opponents, since it is better to preserve one’s own liberty than to deprive others of theirs.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch’s <title rend="italic">Life of Agesilaus</title>, chap. xi.

But because of the simplicity of his clothes he came into contempt among the people there; for they had been expecting that they should see the king of Sparta, like the king of Persia, with his person magnificently apparelled-a sorry opinion for them to hold regarding kings.

And upon his hand he wrote the word victory with the letters turned towards the left. Then, as he received the liver from the priest, he placed it on the hand which had the writing upon it. Holding it for rather a long time, he showed perplexity, and kept up a pretence of not knowing what to do, until the marks of the letters had been taken up by the liver and imprinted upon it. Then he exhibited it to those who with him were to engage in the struggle, saying that the gods through the letters had revealed victory. So his men, feeling that they had a sure sign that they were to overcome the enemy, became bold for the battle. <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A similar trick of Alexander’s is told by Frontinus, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Strategemata</title>, i. 11. 14.</note> </p> </div>

But they say that Cratidas, who at that time was at the head of the Ephors, anxious lest, if the speech should be read, it might convert the people to this way of thinking, restrained Agesilaus and said that he ought not to disinter Lysander, but to inter the speech along with him, since it was composed with a vicious purpose and in a plausible vein. <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the note on <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 212 C (52), <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>. </note> <pb xml:id="v.3.p.379"/> </p> </div>
