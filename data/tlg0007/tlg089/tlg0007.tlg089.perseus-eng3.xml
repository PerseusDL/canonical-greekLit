	<p rend="indent"> Plutarch’s knowledge of Egyptology was not profound. It is true that he once visited Egypt,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 678 c.</note> but how long he stayed and how much he learned we have no means of knowing. It is most likely that his treatise represents the knowledge current in his day, derived, no doubt, from two sources: books and priests. The gods of Egypt had early found a welcome in other lands, in Syria and Asia Minor, and later in Greece and Rome. That the worship of Isis had been introduced into Greece before 330 b.c. is certain from an inscription found in the Peiraeus (<title rend="italic">I.G.</title> II.¹ 168, or II.² 337; Dittenberger, <title rend="italic">Sylloge</title>³ , 280, or 551²), in which the merchants from Citium ask permission to found a shrine of Aphrodite on the same terms as those on which the Egyptians had founded a shrine of Isis. In Delos there was a shrine of the Egyptian gods, and in Plutarch’s own town they must have been honoured, for there have been found two dedications to Serapis, Isis, and Anubis,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Collitz, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Sammlung der griechischen Dialektinschriften</title>, vol. i. pp. 149-155.</note> as well as numerous inscriptions recording the manumission of slaves, which in Greece was commonly accomplished by dedicating them to a god, who, in these inscriptions, is Serapis (Sarapis). An idea of the widespread <pb xml:id="v.5.p.4"/> worship of Egyptian gods in Greek lands may be obtained from Roscher, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und romischen Mythologie</title>, vol. ii. pp. 379-392, where the cults of Isis are listed. </p> <p rend="indent"> Another source of information available to Plutarch was books. Herodotus in the fifth century b.c. had visited Egypt, and he devoted a large part of the second book of his History to the manners and customs of the Egyptians. Plutarch, however, draws but little from him. Some of the information that Plutarch gives us may be found also in Diodorus Siculus, principally in the first book, but a little also in the second. Aelian and, to a less extent, other writers mentioned in the notes on the text, have isolated fragments of information which usually agree with Plutarch and Diodorus. All this points to the existence of one or more books, now lost, which contained this information, possibly in a systematic form. As a result, Plutarch has many things right and some wrong. Those who are interested in these matters may consult Erman-Grapow, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache</title> (Leipzig, 1925-1929), and G. Parthey’s edition of the <title rend="italic">Isis and Osiris</title> (Berlin, 1850). </p> <p rend="indent"> One matter which will seem very unscientific to the modern reader is Plutarch’s attempts to explain the derivation of various words, especially his attempt to derive Egyptian words from Greek roots; but in this respect he sins no more than Plato, who has given us some most atrocious derivations of Greek words, especially in the <title rend="italic">Cratylus</title>; nor is it more disastrous than Herodotus’s industrious attempts (in Book II) to derive all manner of Greek customs, ritual, and theology from Egypt. </p> <p rend="indent"> In spite of minor errors contained in the <title rend="italic">Isis and</title> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.5"/> <title rend="italic">Osiris</title>, no other work by a Greek writer is more frequently referred to by Egyptologists except, possibly, Herodotus. Connected information may, of course, be found in histories of Egypt, such as those of Breasted and Baikie.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">All the Greek and Roman sources for the religion of the Egyptians will be found conveniently collected in Hopfner, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Fontes Historiae Religionis Aegyptiacae</title>, Parts I. and II. (Bonn, 1922-1923).</note> </p> <p rend="indent"> The work is dedicated to Clea, a cultured and intelligent woman, priestess at Delphi, to whom Plutarch dedicated also his book on the <title rend="italic">Bravery of Women</title> (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 242 e - 263 c, contained in vol. iii. of L.C.L. pp. 473-581). It is, no doubt, owing to this that the author, after he has unburdened himself of his information on Egyptology, goes on to make some very sane remarks on the subject of religion and the proper attitude in which to approach it. This part of the essay ranks with the best of Plutarch’s writing. The Ms. tradition of the essay is bad, as may be seen from the variations found in the few passages quoted by later writers such as Eusebius and Stobaeus; yet much has been done by acute scholars to make the text more intelligible. It may not be invidious to mention among those who have made special contributions to the study of this work W. Baxter, who translated it (1684), and S. Squire, who edited it (1744). Many other names will be found in the critical notes. </p> <p rend="indent"> The essay is No. 118 in Lamprias’s list of Plutarch’s works, where the title is given as an account of Isis and Serapis. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.7"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <p rend="indent">All good things, my dear Clea,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The priestess for whom Plutarch composed his collection of stories about the <title rend="italic">Bravery of Women</title> (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 242 e ff.).</note> sensible men must ask from the gods; and especially do we pray that from those mighty gods we may, in our quest, gain a knowledge of themselves, so far as such a thing is attainable by men.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 780 f - 781 a and 355 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> For we believe that there is nothing more important for man to receive, or more ennobling for God of His grace to grant, than the truth. God gives to men the other things for which they express a desire, but of sense and intelligence He grants them only a share, inasmuch as these are His especial possessions and His sphere of activity. For the Deity is not blessed by reason of his possession of gold and silver,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Themistius, <title rend="italic">Oration</title> xxxiii. p. 365 b-d.</note> nor strong because of thunder and lightning, but through knowledge and intelligence. Of all the things that Homer said about the gods, he has expressed most beautifully this thought:<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, xiii. 354; quoted also in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 32 a, and <title rend="italic">Life and Writings of Homer</title>, ii. 114.</note> <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Both, indeed, were in lineage one, and of the same country, </l> <l>Yet was Zeus the earlier born and his knowledge was greater.</l> </quote> Thereby the poet plainly declares that the primacy of Zeus is nobler since it is elder in knowledge and in <pb xml:id="v.5.p.9"/> wisdom. I think also that a source of happiness in the eternal life, which is the lot of God, is that events which come to pass do not escape His prescience. But if His knowledge and meditation on the nature of Existence should be taken away, then, to my mind, His immortality is not living, but a mere lapse of time.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 781 a.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"> <p rend="indent">Therefore the effort to arrive at the Truth, and especially the truth about the gods, is a longing for the divine. For the search for truth requires for its study and investigation the consideration of sacred subjects, and it is a work more hallowed than any form of holy living or temple service; and, not least of all, it is well-pleasing to that goddess whom you worship, a goddess exceptionally wise and a lover of wisdom, to whom, as her name at least seems to indicate, knowledge and understanding are in the highest degree appropriate. For Isis is a Greek word,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch is attempting to connect <q>Isis</q> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶδα</foreign>, <emph>know</emph>, and <q>Typhon</q> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τυφῶ</foreign>, <emph>puff up</emph>. See, however, 375 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> and so also is Typhon, her enemy, who is conceited, as his name implies,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch is attempting to connect <q>Isis</q> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶδα</foreign>, <emph>know</emph>, and <q>Typhon</q> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τυφῶ</foreign>, <emph>puff up</emph>. See, however, 375 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> because of his ignorance and self-deception. He tears to pieces and scatters to the winds the sacred writings, which the goddess collects and puts together and gives into the keeping of those that are initiated into the holy rites, since this consecration, by a strict regimen and by abstinence from many kinds of food and from the lusts of the flesh, curtails licentiousness and the love of pleasure, and induces a habit of patient submission to the stem and rigorous services in shrines, the end and aim of which is the knowledge of Him who is the First, the Lord of All, the Ideal One.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 355 e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> Him does the goddess urge us to seek, since He is near her and with her and in close communion. The name of her shrine also clearly promises knowledge and <pb xml:id="v.5.p.11"/> comprehension of reality; for it is named Iseion,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">As if derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶδα</foreign>, <emph>know</emph>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄν</foreign>, <emph>being</emph>.</note> to indicate that we shall comprehend reality if in a reasonable and devout frame of mind we pass within the portals of her shrines. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> <p rend="indent">Moreover, many writers have held her to be the daughter of Hermes,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 355 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> and many others the daughter of Prometheus,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 365 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, and Clement of Alexandria, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Stromateis</title>, i. 106. 1, 21 (p. 382, Potter).</note> because of the belief that Prometheus is the discoverer of wisdom and forethought, and Hermes the inventor of grammar and music. For this reason they call the first of the Muses at Hermopolis Isis as well as Justice: for she is wise, as I have said,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, 351 f.</note> and discloses the divine mysteries to those who truly and justly have the name of <q>bearers of the sacred vessels</q> and <q>wearers of the sacred robes.</q> These are they who within their own soul, as though within a casket, bear the sacred writings about the gods clear of all superstition and pedantry; and they cloak them with secrecy, thus giving intimations, some dark and shadowy, some clear and bright, of their concepts about the gods, intimations of the same sort as are clearly evidenced in the wearing of the sacred garb.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Dittenberger, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum</title>, No. 754 (not included in the third edition), or <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Altertümer von Pergamon</title>, viii. 2, p. 248, no. 326; also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 382 c.</note> For this reason, too, the fact that the deceased votaries of Isis are decked with these garments is a sign that these sacred writings accompany them, and that they pass to the other world possessed of these and of naught else. It is a fact, Clea, that having a beard and wearing a coarse cloak does not make philosophers, nor does dressing in linen and shaving the hair make votaries of Isis; but the true votary of Isis <pb xml:id="v.5.p.13"/> is he who, when he has legitimately received what is set forth in the ceremonies connected with these gods, uses reason in investigating and in studying the truth contained therein. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> <p rend="indent">It is true that most people are unaware of this very ordinary and minor matter: the reason why the priests remove their hair and wear linen garments.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, ii. 37 and 81.</note> Some persons do not care at all to have any knowledge about such things, while others say that the priests, because they revere the sheep,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In Saïs and Thebaïs according to Strabo, xvii. 40 (p. 812).</note> abstain from using its wool, as well as its flesh; and that they shave their heads as a sign of mourning, and that they wear their linen garments because of the colour which the flax displays when in bloom, and which is like to the heavenly azure which enfolds the universe. But for all this there is only one true reason, which is to be found in the words of Plato<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Phaedo</title>, 67 b; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 108 d.</note>; <q>for the Impure to touch the Pure is contrary to divine ordinance.</q> No surplus left over from food and no excrementitious matter is pure and clean; and it is from forms of surplus that wool, fur, hair, and nails originate and grow.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Apuleius, <title rend="italic">Apology</title>, chap. 26.</note> So it would be ridiculous that these persons in their holy living should remove their own hair by shaving and making their bodies smooth all over,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, ii. 37.</note> and then should put on and wear the hair of domestic animals. We should believe that when Hesiod<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 742-743. The meaning of these somewhat cryptic lines is, of course, that one should not pare one’s nails at table; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, ed.

But the flax springs from the earth which is immortal; it yields edible seeds, and supplies a plain and cleanly clothing, which does not oppress by the weight required for warmth. It is suitable for every season and, as they say, is least apt to breed lice; but this topic is treated elsewhere.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch touches briefly on this subject in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 642 c.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"> <p rend="indent">The priests feel such repugnance for things that are of a superfluous nature that they not only eschew most legumes, as well as mutton and pork,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, ii. 37, and <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 286 e.</note> which leave a large residuum, but they also use no salt<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. infra</foreign>, 363 e; <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 684 f, 729 a; and Arrian, <title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>, iii. 4. 4.</note> with their food during their periods of holy living. For this they have various other reasons, but in particular the fact that salt, by sharpening the appetite, makes them more inclined to drinking and eating. To consider salt impure, because, as Aristagoras has said, when it is crystallizing many minute creatures are caught in it and die there, is certainly silly. </p> <p rend="indent"> It is said also that they water the Apis from a well of his own, and keep him away from the Nile altogether, not that they think the water unclean because of the crocodile, as some believe; for there is nothing which the Egyptians hold in such honour as the Nile. But the drinking of the Nile water is <pb xml:id="v.5.p.17"/> reputed to be fattening and to cause obesity.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aelian, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Natura Animalium</title>, xi. 10.</note> They do not want Apis to be in this condition, nor themselves either; but rather they desire that their bodies, the encasement of their souls, shall be well adjusted and light, and shall not oppress and straiten the divine element by the predominance and preponderance of the mortal. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"> <p rend="indent">As for wine, those who serve the god in Heliopolis bring none at all into the shrine, since they feel that it is not seemly to drink in the day-time while their Loi’d and King is looking upon them.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Iamblichus, <title rend="italic">Life of Pythagoras</title>, 97 and 98, who says that the Pythagoreans would have nothing to do with wine in the day-time. See also the critical note on the opposite page.</note> The others use wine, but in great moderation. They have many periods of holy living when wine is prohibited, and in these they spend their time exclusively in studying, learning, and teaching religious matters. Their kings also were wont to drink a limited quantity<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Diodorus, i. 70. 11.</note> prescribed by the sacred writings, as Hecataeus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</title>, ii. p. 153, Hecataeus no. B 11.</note> has recorded; and the kings are priests. The beginning of their drinking dates from the reign of Psammetichus; before that they did not drink wine nor use it in libation as something dear to the gods, thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods, and from whom, when they had fallen and had become commingled with the earth, they believed vines to have sprung. This is the reason why drunkenness drives men out of their senses and crazes them, inasmuch as they are then filled with the blood of their forbears. These tales Eudoxus says in the second book of his <title rend="italic">World Travels</title> are thus related by the priests. <pb xml:id="v.5.p.19"/> </p> </div>

She removed it with the greatest ease and cut away the wood of the heather which surrounded the chest; then, when she had wrapped up the wood in a linen cloth and had poured perfume upon it, she <pb xml:id="v.5.p.43"/> entrusted it to the care of the kings; and even to this day the people of Byblus venerate this wood which is preserved in the shrine of Isis. Then the goddess threw herself down upon the coffin with such a dreadful wailing that the younger of the king’s sons expired on the spot. The elder son she kept with her, and, having placed the coffin on board a boat, she put out from land. Since the Phaedrus river toward the early morning fostered a rather boisterous wind, the goddess grew angry and dried up its stream. </p> </div>

Horus answered that a lion was a useful thing for a man in need of assistance, but that a horse served best for cutting off the flight of an enemy and annihilating him. When Osiris heard this he was much pleased, since he felt that Horus had now an adequate preparation. It is said that, as many were continually transferring their allegiance to Horus, Typhon’s concubine, Thueris, also came over to him; and a serpent which pursued her was cut to pieces by Horus’s men, and now, in memory of this, the people throw down a rope in their midst and chop it up. <pb xml:id="v.5.p.49"/> </p> <p rend="indent"> Now the battle, as they relate, lasted many days and Horus prevailed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"> <p rend="indent">The insidious scheming and usurpation of Typhon, then, is the power of drought, which gains control and dissipates the moisture which is the source of the Nile and of its rising; and his coadjutor, the Queen of the Ethiopians,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 356 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> signifies allegorically the south winds from Ethiopia; for whenever these gain the upper hand over the northerly or Etesian winds<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 898 a, and Diodorus, i. 39.</note> which drive the clouds towards Ethiopia, and when they prevent the falling of the rains which cause the rising of the Nile, then Typhon, being in possession, blazes with scorching heat; and having gained complete mastery, he forces the Nile in retreat to draw back its waters for weakness, and, flowing at the bottom of its almost empty channel, to proceed to the sea. The story told of the shutting up of Osiris in the chest seems to mean nothing else than the vanishing and disappearance of water. Consequently they say that the disappearance of Osiris occurred in the month of Athyr,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The month of November.</note> at the time when, owing to the complete cessation of the Etesian winds, the Nile recedes to its low level and the land becomes denuded. As the nights grow longer, the darkness increases, and the potency of the light is abated and subdued. Then among the gloomy rites which the priests perform, they shroud the gilded image of a cow with a black linen vestment, and display her as a sign of mourning for the goddess, inasmuch as they regard both the cow and the earth<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 366 a <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.97"/> as the image of Isis; and this is kept up for four days consecutively, beginning with the seventeenth of the month. The things mourned for are four in number: first, the departure and recession of the Nile; second, the complete extinction of the north winds, as the south winds gain the upper hand; third, the day’s growing shorter than the night; and, to crown all, the denudation of the earth together with the defoliation of the trees and shrubs at this time. On the nineteenth day they go down to the sea at nighttime; and the keepers of the robes and the priests bring forth the sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water which they have taken up, and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found. Then they knead some fertile soil with the water and mix in spices and incense of a very costly sort, and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they clothe and adorn, thus indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water. </p> </div>

Even if this story were not current among them, one would hardly <pb xml:id="v.5.p.99"/> be justified in rejecting that other account, to the effect that Typhon, many ages ago, held sway over Osiris’s domain; for Egypt used to be all a sea,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, ii. 5; Diodorus, iii. 3, and i. 39. 11.</note> and, for that reason, even to-day it is found to have shells in its mines and mountains.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, ii. 12.</note> Moreover, all the springs and wells, of which there are many, have a saline and brackish water, as if some stale dregs of the ancient sea had collected there. </p> <p rend="indent"> But, in time, Horas overpowered Typhon; that is to say, there carne on a timely abundance of rain, and the Nile forced out the sea and revealed the fertile land, which it filled out with its alluvial deposits. This has support in the testimony of our own observation; for we see, even to-day, as the river brings down new silt and advances the land, that the deep waters gradually recede and, as the bottom gains in height by reason of the alluvial deposits, the water of the sea runs off from these. We also note that Pharos, which Homer<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> iv. 356. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Strabo, xii. 2. 4 (p. 536), and xvii. 1. 6 (p. 791).</note> knew as distant a day’s sail from Egypt, is now a part of it; not that the island has extended its area by rising, or has come nearer to the land, but the sea that separated them was obliged to retire before the river, as the river reshaped the land and made it to increase. </p> <p rend="indent"> The fact is that all this is somewhat like the doctrines promulgated by the Stoics<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> von Arnim, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</title>, ii. 1093 (p. 319).</note> about the gods; for they say that the creative and fostering spirit is Dionysus, the truculent and destructive is Heracles, the receptive is Ammon, that which pervades the Earth and its products is Demeter and the Daughter, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.101"/> and that which pervades the Sea is Poseidon.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Cicero, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Natura Deorum</title>, i. 15 (40), ii. 28 (71); and Diogenes Laertius, vii. 147.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"> <p rend="indent">But the Egyptians, by combining with these physical explanations some of the scientific results derived from astronomy, think that by Typhon is meant the solar world, and by Osiris the lunar world; they reason that the moon, because it has a light that is generative and productive of moisture,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 658 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> is kindly towards the young of animals and the burgeoning plants, whereas the sun, by its untempered and pitiless heat, makes all growing and flourishing vegetation hot and parched, and, through its blazing light, renders a large part of the earth uninhabitable, and in many a region overpowers the moon. For this reason the Egyptians regularly call Typhon <q>Seth,</q> <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 371 b and 376 a, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> which, being interpreted, means <q>overmastering and compelling.</q> They have a legend that Heracles, making his dwelling in the sun, is a companion for it in its revolutions, as is the case also with Hermes and the moon.

The wood which they cut on the occasions called the <q>burials of Osiris</q> they fashion into a crescent-shaped coffer because of the fact that the moon, when it comes near the sun, becomes crescent-shaped and disappears from our sight. The dismemberment of Osiris into fourteen parts they refer allegorically to the days of the waning of that satellite from the time of the full moon to the new moon. And the day on which she becomes visible after escaping the solar rays and passing by the sun they style <q>Incomplete Good</q>; for Osiris is beneficent, and his name means many things, but, not least of all, an active and beneficent power, as they put it.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"> <p rend="indent">They think that the risings of the Nile have some relation to the illuminations of the moon; for <pb xml:id="v.5.p.105"/> the greatest rising,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Besides the famous ancient Nilometer at Elephantinê, others have been found at Philae, Edfu, and Esna.</note> in the neighbourhood of Elephantinê, is twenty-eight cubits, which is the number of its illuminations that form the measure of each of its monthly cycles; the rising in the neighbourhood of Mendes and Xoïs, which is the least, is six cubits, corresponding to the first quarter.

Thus they make the power of Osiris to be fixed in the Moon, and say that Isis, since she is generation, is associated with him. For this reason they also call the Moon the mother of the world, and they think that she has a nature both male and female, as she is receptive and made pregnant by the Sun, but she herself in turn emits and disseminates into the air generative principles. For, as they believe, the destructive activity of Typhon does not always prevail, but oftentimes is overpowered by such generation and put in bonds, and then at a later time is again released and contends against Horus,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 358 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> who is the terrestrial universe; and this is never completely exempt either from dissolution or from generation. <pb xml:id="v.5.p.107"/> </p> </div>

And among the Egyptians Anubis is thought to possess this faculty, which is similar to that which Hecatê is thought to possess among the Greeks, for Anubis is a deity of the lower world as well as a god of Olympus. Some are of the opinion that Anubis is Cronus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"> <p rend="indent">for God is not senseless nor inanimate nor subject to human control. As a result of this we have come to regard as gods those who make use of these things and present them to us and provide us with things everlasting and constant.

Thus men make use of consecrated symbols, some employing symbols that are obscure, but others those that are clearer, in guiding the intelligence toward things divine, though not without a certain hazard.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"> <p rend="indent">Wherefore in the study of these matters it is especially necessary that we adopt, as our guide in these mysteries, the reasoning that comes from philosophy, and consider reverently each one of the things that are said and done, so that, to quote Theodorus,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 467 b.</note> who said that while he offered the good word with his right hand some of his auditors received it in their left, we may not thus err by accepting in a different spirit the things that the laws have dictated admirably concerning the sacrifices and festivals. The fact that everything is to be referred to reason we may gather from the Egyptians themselves; for on the nineteenth day of the first month, when they are holding festival in honour of Hermes, they eat honey and a fig; and as they eat they say, <q>A sweet <pb xml:id="v.5.p.159"/> thing is Truth.</q> The amulet<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 377 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> of Isis, which they traditionally assert that she hung about her neck, is interpreted <q>a true voice.</q> And Harpocrates is not to be regarded as an imperfect and an infant god, nor some deity or other that protects legumes, but as the representative and corrector of unseasoned, imperfect, and inarticulate reasoning about the gods among mankind. For this reason he keeps his finger on his lips in token of restrained speech or silence. In the month of Mesorê they bring to him an offering of legumes and say, <q>The tongue is luck, the tongue is god.</q> Of the plants in Egypt they say that the persea is especially consecrated to the goddess because its fruit resembles a heart and its leaf a tongue. The fact is that nothing of mans usual possessions is more divine than reasoning, especially reasoning about the gods; and nothing has a greater influence toward happiness. For this reason we give instructions to anyone who comes down to the oracle here to think holy thoughts and to speak words of good omen. But the mass of mankind act ridiculously in their processions and festivals in that they proclaim at the outset the use of words of good omen,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The regular proclamation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφημεῖτε</foreign>) used by the Greeks at the beginning of any ceremony.</note> but later they both say and think the most unhallowed thoughts about the very gods. </p> </div>

The Phrygians, believing that the god is asleep in the winter and awake in the summer, sing lullabies for him in the winter and in the summer chants to arouse him, after the manner of bacchic worshippers. The Paphlagonians assert that in the winter he is bound fast and imprisoned, but that in the spring he bestirs himself and sets himself free again. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"> <p rend="indent">The season of the year also gives us a suspicion that this gloominess is brought about because of the disappearance from our sight of the crops and fruits that people in days of old did not regard as gods, but as necessary and important contributions of the gods toward the avoidance of a savage and a bestial life. At the time of year when they saw some of the fruits vanishing and disappearing completely from the trees, while they themselves were sowing others in a mean and poverty-stricken fashion still, scraping <pb xml:id="v.5.p.163"/> away the earth with their hands and again replacing it, committing the seeds to the ground with uncertain expectation of their ever appearing again or coming to fruition, they did many things like persons at a funeral in mourning for their dead. Then again, even as we speak of the man who buys the books of Plato as <q>buying Plato,</q> and of the man who represents the poems of Menander as <q>acting Menander,</q> even so those men of old did not refrain from calling by the names of the gods the gifts and creations of the gods, honouring and venerating them because of the need which they had for them. The men of later times accepted this blindly, and in their ignorance referred to the gods the behaviour of the crops and the presence and disappearance of necessities, not only calling them the births and deaths of the gods, but even believing that they are so; and thus they filled their minds with absurd, unwarranted, and confused opinions although they had before their eyes the absurdity of such illogical reasoning. Rightly did Xenophanes<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. 44, Xenophanes, no. a 13; also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 171 d, 228 e, and 763 d; and Heracleitus, no. b 127 (Diels, i. 103).</note> of Colophon insist that the Egyptians, if they believed these to be gods, should not lament them; but if they lamented them, they should not believe them to be gods. Is it anything but ridiculous amid their lamentations to pray that the powers may cause their crops to sprout again and bring them to perfection in order that they again be consumed and lamented ? </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"> <p rend="indent">This is not quite the case: but they do lament for their crops and they do pray to the gods, who are the authors and givers, that they produce and cause to grow afresh other new crops to take the place of those that are undergoing destruction.

There is engendered a dangerous belief, which plunges the weak and innocent into sheer superstition, and in the case of the <pb xml:id="v.5.p.167"/> more cynical and bold, goes off into atheistic and brutish reasoning.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the note on 355 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> Wherefore it is not inappropriate to rehearse in some detail what seem to be the facts in these matters. </p> </div>

The further notion that as many of the souls of the dead as continue to exist are reborn into these animals only is likewise incredible. Of those who desire to assign to this some political reason some relate that Osiris, on his great expedition, divided his forces into many parts, which the Greeks call squads and companies, and to them all he gave standards in the form of animals, each of which came to be regarded as sacred and precious by the descendants of them who had shared in the assignment. Others relate that the later kings, to strike their enemies with terror, appeared in battle after putting on gold and silver masks of wild beasts’ heads. Others record that one of these crafty and unscrupulous kings,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ibid.</foreign> i. 89. 5 and 90.</note> having observed that the Egyptians were by nature light-minded and readily inclined to change and novelty, but that, because of their numbers, they had a strength that was invincible and very difficult to check when they were in their sober senses and acted in concert, communicated to them and planted among them an everlasting superstition, a ground for unceasing quarrelling. For he enjoined <pb xml:id="v.5.p.169"/> on different peoples to honour and revere different animals; and inasmuch as these animals conducted themselves with enmity and hostility toward one another, one by its nature desiring one kind of food and another another, the several peoples were ever defending their own animals, and were much offended if these animals suffered injury, and thus they were drawn on unwittingly by the enmities of the animals until they were brought into open hostility with one another. Even to-day the inhabitants of Lycopolis are the only people among the Egyptians that eat a sheep; for the wolf, whom they hold to be a god, also eats it. And in my day the people of Oxyrhynchus caught a dog and sacrificed it and ate it up as if it had been sacrificial meat,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 353 c and 358 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>; Aelian, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Natura Animalium</title>, xi. 27, and Juvenal, xv. 35.</note> because the people of Cynopolis were eating the fish known as the oxyrhynchus or pike.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"> <p rend="indent">If, then, the most noted of the philosophers, observing the riddle of the Divine in inanimate and incorporeal objects, have not thought it proper to treat any thing with carelessness or disrespect, even more do I think that, in all likelihood, we should welcome those peculiar properties existent in natures which possess the power of perception and have a soul and feeling and character. It is not that we should honour these, but that through these we should honour the Divine, since they are the clearer mirrors of the Divine by their nature also, so that we should regard them as the instrument or device of the God who orders all things. And in general we must hold it true that nothing inanimate is superior to what is animate, ana nothing without the power of perception is superior to that which has that power - no, not even if one should heap together all the gold and emeralds in the world. The Divine is not engendered in colours or in forms or in polished surfaces, but whatsoever things have no share in life, things whose nature does not allow them to share therein, have a portion of less honour than that of the dead. But the nature that lives and sees and has within itself the source of movement and a knowledge of what belongs to it and <pb xml:id="v.5.p.181"/> what belongs to others, has drawn to itself an efflux and portion of beauty from the Intelligence <q>by which the Universe is guided,</q> as Heracleitus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. 86, Heracleitus, no. b 41.</note> has it.

But the robe of Osiris has no shading or variety in its colour, but only one single colour like to light. For the beginning is combined with nothing else, and that which is primary and conceptual is without admixture; wherefore, when they have once taken off the robe of Osiris, they lay it away and guard it, unseen and untouched. But the robes of Isis they use many times over; for in use those things that are perceptible and ready at hand afford many disclosures of themselves and opportunities to view them as they are changed about in various ways.

But when these souls are set free and migrate into the realm of the invisible and the unseen, the dispassionate and the pure, then this god becomes their leader and king, since it is on him that they are bound to be dependent in their insatiate contemplation and yearning for that beauty which is for men unutterable and indescribable.

But the rarefication is more effective if they burn fragrant woods, such as that of the cypress, the juniper, and the pine.
