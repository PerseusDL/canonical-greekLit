            <head>ISIS AND OSIRIS
					(DE ISIDE ET OSIRIDE)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					Plutarch's knowledge of Egyptology was not profound. It is true that he once visited Egypt,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 678 c.</note> but how
					long he stayed and how much he learned we have no
					means of knowing. It is most likely that his treatise
					represents the knowledge current in his day, derived,
					no doubt, from two sources : books and priests. The
					gods of Egypt had early found a welcome in other
					lands, in Syria and Asia Minor, and later in Greece
					and Rome. That the worship of Isis had been introduced into Greece before 330 b.c. is certain from an
					inscription found in the Peiraeus (<hi rend="italics">I.G.</hi> II.<hi rend="super">1</hi> 168, or
					II.<hi rend="super">2</hi> 337 ; Dittenberger, <hi rend="italics">Sylloge</hi>
               <hi rend="super">3</hi>, 280, or 551<hi rend="super">2</hi>), in
					which the merchants from Citium ask permission to
					found a shrine of Aphrodite on the same terms as
					those on which the Egyptians had founded a shrine of
					Isis. In Delos there was a shrine of the Egyptian
					gods, and in Plutarch's own town they must have
					been honoured, for there have been found two dedications to Serapis, Isis, and Anubis,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Collitz, <hi rend="italics">Sammlung der griechischen Dialektinschriften</hi>, vol. i. pp. 149-155.</note> as well as numerous
					inscriptions recording the manumission of slaves,
					which in Greece was commonly accomplished by
					dedicating them to a god, who, in these inscriptions,
					is Serapis (Sarapis). An idea of the widespread
					
					<pb n="v.5.p.4"/>
					
					worship of Egyptian gods in Greek lands may be
					obtained from Roscher, <hi rend="italics">Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und romischen Mythologie</hi>, vol. ii. pp. 379-392,
					where the cults of Isis are listed.
				</p>
            <p>
					Another source of information available to Plutarch
					was books. Herodotus in the fifth century b.c. had
					visited Egypt, and he devoted a large part of the
					second book of his History to the manners and
					customs of the Egyptians. Plutarch, however, draws
					but little from him. Some of the information that
					Plutarch gives us may be found also in Diodorus
					Siculus, principally in the first book, but a little also
					in the second. Aelian and, to a less extent, other
					writers mentioned in the notes on the text, have
					isolated fragments of information which usually agree
					with Plutarch and Diodorus. All this points to the
					existence of one or more books, now lost, which contained this information, possibly in a systematic form.
					As a result, Plutarch has many things right and some
					wrong. Those who are interested in these matters
					may consult Erman-Grapow, <hi rend="italics">Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache</hi> (Leipzig, 1925-1929), and G. Parthey's
					edition of the <hi rend="italics">Isis and Osiris</hi> (Berlin, 1850).
				</p>
            <p>
					One matter which will seem very unscientific to the
					modern reader is Plutarch's attempts to explain the
					derivation of various words, especially his attempt to
					derive Egyptian words from Greek roots ; but in this
					respect he sins no more than Plato, who has given
					us some most atrocious derivations of Greek words,
					especially in the <hi rend="italics">Cratylus</hi>; nor is it more disastrous
					than Herodotus's industrious attempts (in Book II)
					to derive all manner of Greek customs, ritual, and
					theology from Egypt.
				</p>
            <p>
					In spite of minor errors contained in the <hi rend="italics">Isis and</hi>
					
					          <pb n="v.5.p.5"/>
					
					          <hi rend="italics">Osiris</hi>, no other work by a Greek writer is more
					frequently referred to by Egyptologists except,
					possibly, Herodotus. Connected information may,
					of course, be found in histories of Egypt, such as
					those of Breasted and Baikie.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">All the Greek and Roman sources for the religion of the Egyptians will be found conveniently collected in Hopfner, <hi rend="italics">Fontes Historiae Religionis Aegyptiacae</hi>, Parts I. and II. (Bonn, 1922-1923).</note>
				        </p>
            <p>
					The work is dedicated to Clea, a cultured and
					intelligent woman, priestess at Delphi, to whom
					Plutarch dedicated also his book on the <hi rend="italics">Bravery of
					Women</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 242 e - 263 c, contained in vol. iii. of
					L.C.L. pp. 473-581). It is, no doubt, owing to this
					that the author, after he has unburdened himself of
					his information on Egyptology, goes on to make some
					very sane remarks on the subject of religion and the
					proper attitude in which to approach it. This part
					of the essay ranks with the best of Plutarch's writing.
					The Ms. tradition of the essay is bad, as may be
					seen from the variations found in the few passages
					quoted by later writers such as Eusebius and Stobaeus;
					yet much has been done by acute scholars to make
					the text more intelligible. It may not be invidious
					to mention among those who have made special contributions to the study of this work W. Baxter, who
					translated it (1684), and S. Squire, who edited it
					(1744). Many other names will be found in the
					critical notes.
				</p>
            <p>
					The essay is No. 118 in Lamprias's list of Plutarch's
					works, where the title is given as an account of Isis
					and Serapis.

            <p>Therefore the effort to arrive at the Truth, and
					especially the truth about the gods, is a longing for
					the divine. For the search for truth requires for its

					of all, it is well-pleasing to that goddess whom you

					reason, too, the fact that the deceased votaries of

					The fact that everything is to be referred to reason
					we may gather from the Egyptians themselves ; for
					on the nineteenth day of the first month, when they
					are holding festival in honour of Hermes, they eat

					interpreted <q>a true voice.</q> And Harpocrates is not
					to be regarded as an imperfect and an infant god,

					as the representative and corrector of unseasoned,
					imperfect, and inarticulate reasoning about the gods
					among mankind. For this reason he keeps his finger
					on his lips in token of restrained speech or silence.
					In the month of Mesorê they bring to him an offering
					of legumes and say, <q>The tongue is luck, the tongue
						is god.</q> Of the plants in Egypt they say that the
					persea is especially consecrated to the goddess
					because its fruit resembles a heart and its leaf a
					tongue. The fact is that nothing of mans usual
					possessions is more divine than reasoning, especially
					reasoning about the gods ; and nothing has a greater
					influence toward happiness. For this reason we give
					instructions to anyone who comes down to the oracle
					here to think holy thoughts and to speak words of

					This has been to no small degree the experience of

					in honour. In these matters the Greeks are correct in
					saying and believing that the dove is the sacred bird of

					<quote rend="blockquote">Dog you shall be, pet of bright Hecatê.</quote>
					But the great majority of the Egyptians, in doing

					connected with their silly practices. There is engendered a dangerous belief, which plunges the weak and

					of the souls of the dead as continue to exist are reborn

					those who desire to assign to this some political reason
					some relate that Osiris, on his great expedition,
					divided his forces into many parts, which the Greeks
					call squads and companies, and to them all he gave
					standards in the form of animals, each of which came
					to be regarded as sacred and precious by the descendants of them who had shared in the assignment.
					Others relate that the later kings, to strike their

					and planted among them an everlasting superstition,
					a ground for unceasing quarrelling. For he enjoined

					on different peoples to honour and revere different

					themselves with enmity and hostility toward one
					another, one by its nature desiring one kind of food

					defending their own animals, and were much offended
					if these animals suffered injury, and thus they were
					drawn on unwittingly by the enmities of the animals
					until they were brought into open hostility with one
					another. Even to-day the inhabitants of Lycopolis
					are the only people among the Egyptians that eat
					a sheep ; for the wolf, whom they hold to be a god,
					also eats it. And in my day the people of Oxyrhynchus

					There is no occasion for surprise that the Egyptians

					Crete there was a statue of Zeus having no ears ; for

					need watching, and that for married women staying
					at home and silence is becoming. The trident of

					sea holds sway, for it. has been assigned to a demesne
					of less importance than the heavens and the air. For

					forms or in polished surfaces, but whatsoever things
					have no share in life, things whose nature does not
					allow them to share therein, have a portion of less
					honour than that of the dead. But the nature that
					lives and sees and has within itself the source of
					movement and a knowledge of what belongs to it and
					
					<pb n="v.5.p.181"/>
					
					what belongs to others, has drawn to itself an efflux
					and portion of beauty from the Intelligence <q>by
						which the Universe is guided,</q> as Heracleitus<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Diels, <hi rend="italics">Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</hi>, i. 86, Heracleitus, no. b 41.</note> has it.
					Wherefore the Divine is no worse represented in
					these animals than in works of bronze and stone which
					are alike subject to destruction and disfiguration, and
					by their nature are void of all perception and comprehension. This, then, is what I most approve in
					the accounts that are given regarding the animals

					dim vision of his presence by means of the apperception which philosophy affords. But when these souls
					are set free and migrate into the realm of the invisible

					Again at midday, when they perceive that the sun

					surrounding atmosphere. In fact, physicians seem to
					
					<pb n="v.5.p.187"/>
					
					bring relief to pestilential affections by making a large
					blazing fire, for this rarefies the air. But the rarefication is more effective if they burn fragrant woods, such
					as that of the cypress, the juniper, and the pine. At
					any rate, they say that Acron, the physician in Athens
					at the time of the great plague, won great repute by
					prescribing the lighting of a fire beside the sick, and

					pleasure, inasmuch as by their warmth and lightness
					they gently relax the brain, which is by nature cold
					and frigid. If it is true that among the Egyptians
