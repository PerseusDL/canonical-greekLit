<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.174"/><p rend="indent">In the <title rend="italic">Greek Questions</title>, as in the <title rend="italic">Roman Questions</title>, Plutarch endeavours to give the reason or explanation of fifty-nine matters concerned with Greek life. The vast majority of them are customs or names and, as the explanations are usually historical, they often go back to very early times. A full commentary may be found in W. R. Halliday, <title rend="italic">The Greek Questions of Plutarch</title> (Oxford, 1928), an excellent work, embodying also much of the modern speculation in regard to primitive religion. </p> <p rend="indent">The sources for the information contained in this essay seem to be somewhat varied, but there is little doubt that Aristotle’s account of the numerous <title rend="italic">Greek Constitutions</title> was Plutarch’s principal source. The matter is treated at length by Halliday. </p> <p rend="indent">J. J. Hartman (<title rend="italic">Mnemosyne</title>, xii. p. 216, or <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Plutarcho scriptore et philosophos</title> p. 139) is the only modern scholar who has doubted the authenticity of the attribution to Plutarch of this work<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <quote xml:lang="lat">Sed praeterea totus liber mera est doctrinae ostentatio,... Chaeronensi metium medico prorsus indigna.</quote> </note>; the author was not primarily interested in ethical matters, according to Hartman, and hence cannot be Plutarch. J. B. Titchener<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See <title rend="italic">The ms. Tradition of Plutarch’s Aetia Graeca and Aetia Romana</title> (Urbana, Illinois, 1924), p. 9.</note> has promised a discussion of this <pb xml:id="v.4.p.175"/> matter, but stylistic considerations alone seem to make it uncertain whether the work is correctly attributed to Plutarch. </p> <p rend="indent">A few of the topics treated in the <title rend="italic">Greek Questions</title> appear also in other works of Plutarch, but the number naturally is not large. </p> <p rend="indent">The ms. tradition is good; the few difficulties found are generally with single words. </p> <p rend="indent">The work is No. 166 in Lamprias’s list of Plutarch’s works, where the title is given as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰτάαι Ἑλλήνων</foreign>. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.177"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Who were the <q>dusty-feet</q> and the <q>directors</q> in Epidaurus? </p> <p rend="indent">There were one hundred and eighty men who directed the State. From these they used to elect councillors whom they called <q>directors.</q> But the majority of the populace spent their life in the coun try. They were called <q>dusty-feet</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This was the serf-class liberated by the tyrants: <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf</foreign>. <title rend="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</title>, vol. iii. p. 554.</note> since, as one may conjecture, they were recognized by their dust-covered feet whenever they carne down to the city. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">Who was the <q>woman that rode on a donkey</q> at Cumae? </p> <p rend="indent">Any woman taken in adultery they used to bring into the market-place and set her on a certam stone in plain sight of everyone. In like manner they then proceeded to mount her upon a donkey, and when she had been led about the circuit of the entire city, she was required again to take her stand upon the same stone, and for the rest of her life to continue in disgrace, bearing the name <q>donkey-rider.</q> After this ceremony they believed that the stone was unclean and they used ritually to purify it. </p> <p rend="indent">The citizens of Cumae had also a certain office called the Guards. The man who held this office used to watch the prison most of the time, but he <pb xml:id="v.4.p.179"/> came to the nocturnal assemblies of the council and led out the kings by the hand and kept them out, until by secret ballot the council had decided on their case, whether they had done wrong or no. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Who is She that Kindles the Fire (hypekkaustria)<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">W. R. Halliday, in <title rend="italic">Harvard Studies in Classical Philology</title>, xxxvi. 165-177, suggests that <q>cohen</q> (= priest) may be contained in this word.</note> among the people of Soli? </p> <p rend="indent">This is the name which they give to the priestess of Athena because she performs certain sacrifices and ceremonies to avert evil. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Who were the Forgetful Ones (<emph>Amnemones</emph>) at Cnidus, and who was the Dismisser<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Grote thus connected <emph>aphester</emph> with the Spartan <emph>apostater</emph> of <title rend="italic">Life of Lycurgus</title>, chap. vi. (43 c); but the matter is very doubtful; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> van Herwerden, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Lex. Supp. Graec.</title> </note> (<emph>Aphester</emph>)? </p> <p rend="indent">They were wont to employ sixty men chosen from the nobles, and appointed for life, as overseers and preliminary advisers in matters of the greatest importance. They were called the Forgetful Ones, one might conjecture, because they could not be held to account for their actions; unless, indeed, it was because they were men who remembered many things.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">On the <foreign xml:lang="lat">lucus a non lucendo</foreign> principle, as Halliday well suggests; or else <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμ</foreign>-<foreign xml:lang="grc">μνήμονες</foreign>, as van Herwerden supposes.</note> He who asked them their opinions was the Dismisser. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">Who are the <q>good</q> among the Arcadians and the Spartans? </p> <p rend="indent">When the Spartans had come to terms with the Tegeans, they made a treaty and set up in common a pillar by the Alpheius. On this, among other matters, was inscribed: <q>The Messenians must be expelled from the country; it shall not be lawful to make men good.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηστὲ χαῖρε</foreign> on Greek tombstones.</note> Aristotle,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 592 (V. Rose); <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 277 b-c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>>.</note> then, in explaining this, states that it means that no one shall be put <pb xml:id="v.4.p.181"/> to death because of assistance given to the Spartan party in Tegea. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">Who is <q>he that selects barley</q> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">krithologos</foreign>) among the Opuntians? </p> <p rend="indent">For sacrifices of very ancient origin most of the Greeks used to employ barley, which the citizens offered as first-fruits of the harvest. Accordingly they called the officer who presided at the sacrifices and brought these first-fruits the Barley-selector. They had two priests: one appointed for sacrifices to the gods, the other for sacrifices to the spirits. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">What were the <q>floating clouds</q>? </p> <p rend="indent">They used to call clouds <q>floating</q> which particularly threatened rain and were in constant motion, as Theophrastus has stated in the fourth book of his <title rend="italic">Meteorology</title>. The passage reads thus: <q>Since also these floating clouds and these compact clouds, which are immovable and very white in colour, exhibit a certain difference of substance which is filled neither with water nor with wind.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">Who is the <q>near-dweller</q> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">platioiketas</foreign>) among the Boeotians? </p> <p rend="indent">This is the name they give in the Aeolian dialect to persons who dwell in the next house or occupy adjoining property, signifying that they hold land near at hand. I shall add one phrase from the Edict of the Guardians of the Law, although there are several more...<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The copyist seems to have omitted the quotation.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">Who is the Consecrator (<foreign xml:lang="grc">hosioter</foreign>) among the Delphians and why do they call one of the months <q>Bysios</q>? <pb xml:id="v.4.p.183"/> </p> <p rend="indent">They call the victim that is sacrificed Consecrator whenever an Holy One<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 365 a, 437 a.</note> is appointed. There are five Holy Ones, who hold office for life; they do a great many things with the co-operation of the oracle-interpreters and with them take part in the holy rites, since they are thought to have descended from Deucalion. </p> <p rend="indent">The month <q>Bysios,</q> as many think, is the month of growth (<emph>physios</emph>); for it begins the spring and during it many plants spring up and come into bloom. But this is not the truth of the matter, for Delphians do not use <emph>b</emph> in place of <emph>ph</emph> (as Macedonians do who say <q>Bilip</q> and <q>balacros</q> and <q>Beronicê</q>), but in place of <emph>p</emph>; thus they naturally say <q>broceed</q> for <q>proceed</q> and <q>bainful</q> for <q>painful.</q> Accordingly <q>Bysios</q> is <q>pysios,</q> the month of oracular inquiry, in which men ask questions and obtain responses from the god; for this is the legitimate and traditional procedure. In this month, then, oracles used to be given and the seventh day of this month they consider the birthday of the god.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ibid.</foreign> 717 d; for the connexion of the number seven with the birth of Apollo see Callimachus, <title rend="italic">Hymn</title> iv. 251 ff.</note> They call this day the day of Many Utterances (<emph>Polyphthoös</emph>) not because they then bake cakes (<emph>phthoïs</emph>),<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Athenaeus, 647 d, 502 b.</note> but because it is a day when many inquire of the god and receive many oracles. For only recently have monthly oracles been given out to inquirers; formerly the prophetic priestess was wont to give responses but once a year on this day, as Callisthenes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Jacoby, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. der griech. Hist.</title> 124 f 49.</note> and Anaxandrides have recorded. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">What is the <q>sheep-escaper</q>? </p> <p rend="indent">It is one of the small plants that grow close to the <pb xml:id="v.4.p.185"/> ground, whose shoots the grazing animals attack, cutting off the tops and injuring them and so spoiling the growth. But when these plants grow up and gain some size and escape injury from the flocks which graze upon them, then they are called <q>sheep-escapers.</q> The evidence for this is Aeschylus.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 123, Aeschylus, Frag. 447.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">Who are the <q>Men repulsed by slings</q>? </p> <p rend="indent">Men from Eretria used to inhabit the island of Corcyra. But Charicrates sailed thither from Corinth with an army and defeated them in war; so the Eretrians embarked in their ships and sailed back home. Their fellow-citizens, however, having learned of the matter before their arrival, barred their return to the country and prevented them from disembarking by showering upon them missiles from slings. Since the exiles were unable either to persuade or to overcome their fellow-citizens, who were numerous and inexorable, they sailed to Thrace and occupied a territory in which, according to tradition, Methon, the ancestor of Orpheus, had formerly lived. So the Eretrians named their city Methonê, but they were also named by their neighbours the <q>Men repulsed by slings.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">Who was <q>Charilla</q> among the Delphians? </p> <p rend="indent">The Delphians celebrate three festivals one after the other which occur every eight<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 421 c.</note> years, the first of which they call Septerion, the second Heroïs, and the third Charilla. </p> <p rend="indent">Now the Septerion seems to be a representation of Apollo’s fight with the Python and the flight to Tempê and pursuit that followed the battle.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 421 c.</note> Some indeed <pb xml:id="v.4.p.187"/> affirm that Apollo fled because he desired purification as a consequence of the slaughter he had done, others that he was following the wounded Python as he fled along the road which we now call the Sacred Way, and was only a little late for the monster’s death; for he overtook him when he had just died from the effects of the wound and had been buried by his son, whose name, as they say, was Aix. The Septerion, then, is a representation of these matters or certain matters of a similar nature.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 418 a-b; Aelian, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Varia Historia</title>, iii. 1, for this festival.</note> </p> <p rend="indent">The greater part of the Heroïs has a secret import which the Thyiads<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 249 e-f.</note> know; but from the portions of the rites that are performed in public one might conjecture that it represents the evocation of Semele. </p> <p rend="indent">The story of Charilla which they relate is somewhat as follows: A famine following a drought oppressed the Delphians, and they came to the palace of their king with their wives and children and made supplication. The king gave portions of barley and legumes to the more notable citizens, for there was not enough for all. But when an orphaned girl, who was still but a small child, approached him and importuned him, he struck her with his sandal and cast the sandal in her face. But, although the girl was poverty-stricken and without protectors, she was not ignoble in character; and when she had withdrawn, she took off her girdle and hanged herself. As the famine increased and diseases also were added thereto, the prophetic priestess gave an oracle to the king that he must appease Charilla, the maiden who had slain herself. Accordingly, when they had discovered with some difficulty that this was the name of the child who had been struck, they performed a certain sacrificial rite combined with purification, <pb xml:id="v.4.p.189"/> which even now they continue to perform every eight years. For the king sits in state and gives a portion of barley-meal and legumes to everyone, alien and citizen alike, and a doll-like image of Charilla is brought thither. When, accordingly, all have received a portion, the king strikes the image with his sandal. The leader of the Thyiads picks up the image and bears it to a certain place which is full of chasms; there they tie a rope round the neck of the image and bury it in the place where they buried Charilla after she had hanged herself. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"> <p rend="indent">What is the <q>beggar’s meat</q> among the Aenianians? </p> <p rend="indent">There have been several migrations of the Aenianians. For first, when they inhabited the region about the Dotian plain, they were expelled by the Lapiths to Aethicia.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 297 b-c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> From there they proceeded to take possession of the region of Molossia about the river Auas, from which they received the name Parauaei. After this they took possession of Cirrha. There, when they had stoned to death Oenoclus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 297 b-c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> their king, at the command of the god, they descended to the country about the Inachus, which was inhabited by Inachians and Achaeans. Since an oracle had declared that if the Inachians gave away any part of their country, they should lose it all, and that if the Aenianians received any part of the land from willing givers, they should gain possession of it, Temon, a notable man among the Aenianians, donned rags and wallet and came to the Inachians in the guise of a beggar. In scorn and mockery their king gave him a clod of earth, which Temon accepted, <pb xml:id="v.4.p.191"/> placed within his wallet, and was evidently satisfied with the gift; for he straightway withdrew without asking for anything more. The Inachian elders were astonished, but, recalling the oracle, they went to the king and told him not to make light of the fellow nor to let him get away. Temon, then, perceiving their intent, hastened his flight and made his escape after vowing a hecatomb to Apollo. </p> <p rend="indent">After this affair the two kings engaged in single combat, and Phemius, king of the Aenianians, observing the Inachian king, Hyperochus, advancing to meet him accompanied by a dog, said that Hyperochus was acting unfairly in bringing on a second combatant. But while Hyperochus was driving off the dog and had his back turned, Phemius hit him with a stone and killed him. The Aenianians gained possession of the country, driving out the Inachians together with the Achaeans, and they revere that stone as sacred, and sacrifice to it and cover it round about with the fat of the sacrificial victim; and whenever they pay the hecatomb to Apollo, they sacrifice a bull to Zeus; and they set aside a select portion of the flesh for the descendants of Temon, and this they call the <q>beggar’s meat.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p rend="indent">Who are the <q>Coliadae</q> among the inhabitants of Ithaca and what is the <emph>phagilos</emph>? </p> <p rend="indent">After the slaughter of the suitors the relatives of the dead men rose up against Odysseus; but Neoptolemus was sent for by both parties to act as arbiter.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Apollodorus, <title rend="italic">Epitome</title>, vii. 40.</note> He adjudged that Odysseus should depart from the country and be exiled for homicide from Cephallenia, Zacynthus, and Ithaca; and that the <pb xml:id="v.4.p.193"/> companions and the relatives of the suitors should recompense Odysseus each year for the injuries which they had done to his estate. Odysseus accordingly departed to Italy; but the recompense he formally transferred to his son, and ordered the inhabitants of Ithaca to pay it to him. The recompense consisted of barley, wine, honeycombs, olive-oil, salt, and beasts for sacrifice that were older than <emph>phagiloi</emph>; according to Aristotle’s<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 507 (ed. V. Rose).</note> statement, a lamb is a <emph>phagilos</emph>. Now Telemachus bestowed freedom upon Eumaeus and his associates, and incorporated them among the citizens; and the clan of the Coliadae is descended from Eumaeus, and that of the Bucolidae from Philoetius.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Eumaeus was the swineherd and Philoetius the cowherd of Odysseus.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p rend="indent">What is <q>the wooden dog</q> among the Locrians? </p> <p rend="indent">Locrus was the son of Physcius, the son of Amphictyon. The son of Locrus and Cabyê was Opus. His father quarrelled with Opus and taking many of the citizens with him he went to seek an oracle concerning a colony. The god told him to found a city where he should chance to be bitten by a wooden dog, and, as he was crossing to the other sea, he trod upon a dog-brier.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Athenaeus, 70 c-d.</note> Greatly troubled by the wound, he spent several days there, during which he explored the country and founded the cities Physcus and Oeantheia and the other cities which the so-called Ozolian Locrians inhabited. </p> <p rend="indent">Some say that the Locrians are called Ozolian because of Nessus; others say that it is because of the serpent Python, since their bodies were washed up <pb xml:id="v.4.p.195"/> by the sea and rotted away in the country of the Locrians. But some say that these men wear fleeces and goatskins and for the most part spend their time with herds of goats, and thus became evil-smelling.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Pausanias, x. 38.</note> But some, on the contrary, assert that, since the country has many flowers, it acquired its name from sweet odour.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p rend="indent">What is it that the Megarians call <emph>aphabroma</emph>? </p> <p rend="indent">When Nisus, from whom Nisaea acquired its name, was king, he took a wife from Boeotia, Habrotê, daughter of Onchestus, the sister of Megareus, a woman who, as it appears, was both exceptionally intelligent and remarkably discreet. When she died, the Megarians mourned her with one accord, and Nisus, wishing that her memory and her repute should be established everlastingly, ordered the women of the city to wear the garment that she used to wear; and because of her he called the garment <emph>aphabroma</emph>. Even the god seems to have furthered the repute of this woman, for often, when the Megarian women wished to make a change in their raiment, he prevented them by an oracle. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p rend="indent">What is the <q>spear-friend</q>? </p> <p rend="indent">In days of old the Megarid used to be settled iri village communities with the citizens divided into five groups.

They say that Ochnê, his cousin, one of the daughters of Colonus, became enamoured of him; but when Eunostus repulsed her advances and, after upbraiding her, departed to accuse her to her brothers, the maiden forestalled him by doing this very thing against him. She incited her brothers, Echemus, Leon, and Bucolus, to kill Eunostus, saying that he had consorted with her by force. They, accordingly, lay in ambush for the young man and slew him. Then Elieus put them in bonds; but Ochnê repented, and was filled with trepidation and, wishing to free herself from the torments caused by her love, and also feeling pity for her brothers, reported the whole truth to Elieus, and he to Colonus.

The child was named Scamander, and he became the king of the country; and he named the Inachus river Scamander after himself, and the stream near by he called Glaucia from his mother.

Two of these ships, as they were sailing out, were destroyed by a thunderbolt in front of the harbour; but the generals kept on with the others, defeated the Megarians, and took six hundred of them alive. Elated by their victory, they conceived the proj ect of overthrowing the oligarchy of the Land-owners at home. Now the officials in charge of the government had provided an occasion for undertaking this, by writing to the generals to bring back the captive Megarians bound in their own fetters. The generals, accordingly, took the letter, and secretly showed it to certain of the Megarians and persuaded them to join with themselves and free the city. When they took counsel together concerning the deed, they decided to knock loose the rings that fastened the fetters, and in this condition to put them on the legs of the Megarians, holding them up with thongs to their girdles, so that the fetters might not slip down and fall off when their legs became relaxed in walking. Having thus equipped the men and given a sword to each, they sailed back to Samos and disembarked, and there they led the Megarians through the market-place to the council-chamber, where practically all the Land-owners were sitting together. Then, at a given signal, the Megarians fell upon them and slew them. When the city had thus been freed, they made citizens of those Megarians who so desired; and they constructed a great building and dedicated the fetters there; and from this the building was called the Hall of Fetters. </p> </div>

This man, whose name was Antagoras, was in the prime of bodily strength, and bade Heracles wrestle with him; if Heracles could throw him, he might carry off the ram. And when Heracles grappled with him, the Meropes came to the aid of Antagoras, and the Greeks to help Heracles, and they were soon engaged in a mighty battle. In the struggle it is said that Heracles, being exhausted by the multitude of his adversaries, fled to the house of a Thracian woman; there, disguising himself in feminine garb, he managed to escape detection. But later, when he had overcome the Meropes in another encounter, and had been purified, he married Chalciopê and assumed a gay-coloured raiment.
