					<pb xml:id="v.12.p.293"/>
					
					not always useful; sometimes, indeed, we find it too
					much and interrupt our use of it. But water is used

					has often existed without fire, but without water
					never. Besides, that which, from the beginning,
					was coincidental with the inception of man is more
					useful than that which was discovered later; for it
					is obvious that Nature bestowed the one as vitally
					necessary, while the other was brought to light by
					luck or contrivance for a superfluous use. Now, none
					may tell of a time when water was unknown to man,
					nor is any god or hero said to be its discoverer; it
					was, in fact, at hand instantly when man appeared
					and was itself the cause of his appearance. But the
					use of fire, they say,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">As, <foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign>, Aeschylus, <title rend="italic">Prometheus</title>, 254. The following words in lozenge brackets are conjecturally supplied.</note> was discovered only a day or
					twro ago by Prometheus; (consequently all our preceding life was deprived of) fire, though it was not
					without water. And that this is no poetic fiction is
					proved by present modes of living; for there are
					certain races of man who live without fire, with no
					house or hearth, under the open sky. And Diogenes<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This anecdote is told with rather more point and relevance in 995 c-d <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note>
					the Cynic reduced the use of fire to a minimum, so

         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
            <p rend="indent">And why do I split hairs by discussing merely

					they range abroad or fly or crawl, upon roots or produce or flesh, all without fire; but without water no

					Then again, of two elements that is more beneficial

					of fuel, for which reason rich people have more of
					it than poor, and kings than private persons; but
					water has another merit in service to man, that of
					equality, with no discrimination. For it needs no

					is fire which, like an all-devouring beast, consumes

					handling and craft and moderation in use than by
					its own nature; but water is never dangerous.
					Further, of two things the one which may be joined
					with its fellow is more useful. Now fire does not admit
					moisture and is of no use when in conjunction with
					it; but water is of service when combined with fire,
					for hot water is healing and well adapted to medicinal
					purposes. A watery fire you will never see; but
					water is as useful to mankind when hot as when cold.

					construct the universe. Among these, again, there
					is a simple mutual distinction, namely, that earth
					and water are a foundation at the bottom of the
					universe, being, like raw material, the substance of
					which things are constructed and moulded, having
					just so much form and organization, and indeed of
					capacity for growth and procreation, as is imparted
					to them by the other elements, air and fire, which
					are makers and artisans and rouse them, lying lifeless
					as they were until then, to the act of creation. Between these two, again, fire and air, there is the distinction that fire assumes the rule and leadership.
					This is clear by induction<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Possibly; but the argument hardly demonstrates this.

					at all, or very little share, in fire.

         </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
            <p rend="indent">And, in general, water is so far from being selfsufficient for the preservation or generation of other
					things that the want of fire is water’s destruction.
					For heat maintains everything in its proper being and
					keeps it in its proper substance, water itself as well
					as everything else. When fire withdraws and fails,
					water putrefies: the dearth of heat is the death and
					destruction of water. It is, of course, marsh waters
					and such as are stagnant, some too that have drained
					into depressions with no outlet, that are bad<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, <q type="unspecified">salt,</q> as, for example, the Dead Sea.</note> and
					finally putrefy<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">

					which preserves everything by stirring up its heat.
					This is the reason why we commonly say that those
					waters are <q type="unspecified">living</q> which have most motion and
					the strongest current; the heat is maintained by
					their motion. How, then, should that not be the more
					useful of two things which has provided what is
					necessary for the other’s existence, as fire does for
					water? And surely that is the more useful, the lack
					of which, if it be entirely taken away, causes the
					living creature to die. For it is obvious that anything
					without which a creature cannot live must have been
					a necessary cause of its existence, while it did exist.
					Now even corpses have moisture which does not
					entirely vanish; otherwise dead bodies would not
					
					<pb xml:id="v.12.p.303"/>
					
					putrefy, since putrefaction is not a change from dry
					to moist, but rather a corruption of the moisture in
					flesh. Death, then, is nothing but the total disappearance of heat and so dead men are extremely cold;
					if you attack them with a razor-blade, you will blunt
					the edge of it through excess of cold. In the living
					creature itself, too, the parts that have the least heat
					are the least sensitive, like bones and hair and the
					parts that are a long way from the heart. And, in
					general, the presence of fire makes a greater difference<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Or adopting Schultz’s (<title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xlvi. 632) emendation: <q type="unspecified">the difference between living and non-living comes from the presence of fire</q>; but the text is hopelessly corrupt.</note> than that of moisture; for it is not mere
					moisture that produces plants and fruits, but warm
					moisture; cold water, of course, is either less productive or not productive at all. Yet if by its own
					nature water were fruitful, it would always bear fruit
					by itself b; but on the contrary it is even harmful.

					is absurd, nor can he exist at all without it; but
					there are differences in kind as in other things. As
					for men who have no need of fire from without, they
					have this experience not because they do not need it,
					but because their own heat more than suffices. This
					must be predicated also of other animals which do
					not need fire.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This clause was transferred here by the editor from 958 c <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign> at the end of the paragraph.</note> So that in this respect, too, the use
					of fire is probably superior. Water is never in such
					a condition as to need no external support, but fire
					is self-sufficient because of its great excellence. As,
					then, a general is better who manages the affairs of
					his city so that it needs no allies from without, so
					also an element is superior which does not often need
					external assistance.

					Yet, to take the opposite point of view, that is more
					useful which we alone make great use of, since by
					the powers of our reason we are able to choose what
					is better. For what is more useful and more profitable
					to man than reason? But brute beasts do not have
					it. What then? Is what has been discovered by the
					foresight of our better part for this reason less useful?
