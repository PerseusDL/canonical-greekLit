Still more might be added to his proofs, sound and thorough as they are; but this is not the place to slay the slain. It is the more to be regretted that Ziegler, in the article on Plutarch in Pauly-Wissowa, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Realencyclopädie</title>, has not had access to Sandbach’s work,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This is very puzzling since Ziegler later (936) cites the same article as authoritative on rhythmical matters.</note> though he does refer to Xylander’s athetesis, only to reject it, and might have mentioned Meziriacus’ as well. </p> <p rend="indent"> Sandbach well observes: <q>To write an exercise on the comparative utility of fire and water may seem so difficult to us moderns who do not have such tasks as part of our education, that we do not recognize how badly the topic is here handled <gap reason="lost" rend="..."/> While it is possible that Plutarch wrote this work as a parody, or when a schoolboy, or under some strange circumstances, yet <gap reason="lost" rend="..."/> the most probable view is that a miserable sophistical exercise on the subject <title rend="italic">Whether fire or water is more useful</title> was fathered on the author of a diversion entitled <title rend="italic">Whether land- or water-animals are more intelligent</title>, just as the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Consolatio ad Apollonium</title> <pb xml:id="v.12.p.289"/> was ascribed to the author of a consolation addressed to his wife, or the <title rend="italic">Lives of the Ten Orators</title> to the author of some more famous biographies.</q> </p> <p rend="indent"> The text is extremely bad, as may be seen by examining Wegehaupt’s topheavy<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Wegehaupt collated some 34 mss. for his edition, all of which he cites separately.</note> apparatus in <title rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">Χάριτες</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="deu">für Friedrich Leo</foreign></title> (Berlin, Weidmann, 1911)? pp. 158-169- It is possible, to be sure, that part at least of the difficulty of the text is due to the author.

         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">Is not that element the more useful of which most of all, everywhere, invariably, we stand in need as a household tool and, I swear, a friend, ready to help us at any time, in any emergency? Yet fire is <pb xml:id="v.12.p.293"/> not always useful; sometimes, indeed, we find it too much and interrupt our use of it. But water is used both winter and summer, sick and well, night and day: there is no time when a man does not need it. That, of course, is the reason why the dead are called <emph>alibantes</emph>, meaning that they are without <emph>libas</emph>, <q>moisture,</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 736 a; Galen, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Temperament.</title> i. 3 (i, p. 522 K.).</note> and for lack of that deprived of life. Man has often existed without fire, but without water never. Besides, that which, from the beginning, was coincidental with the inception of man is more useful than that which was discovered later; for it is obvious that Nature bestowed the one as vitally necessary, while the other was brought to light by luck or contrivance for a superfluous use. Now, none may tell of a time when water was unknown to man, nor is any god or hero said to be its discoverer; it was, in fact, at hand instantly when man appeared and was itself the cause of his appearance. But the use of fire, they say,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">As, <foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign>, Aeschylus, <title rend="italic">Prometheus</title>, 254. The following words in lozenge brackets are conjecturally supplied.</note> was discovered only a day or twro ago by Prometheus; (consequently all our preceding life was deprived of) fire, though it was not without water. And that this is no poetic fiction is proved by present modes of living; for there are certain races of man who live without fire, with no house or hearth, under the open sky. And Diogenes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This anecdote is told with rather more point and relevance in 995 c-d <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> the Cynic reduced the use of fire to a minimum, so that he even swallowed a squid raw, remarking, <q>Thus, gentlemen, do I risk my life for you.</q> But <pb xml:id="v.12.p.295"/> without water no one ever thought it good, or even possible, to live. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">And why do I split hairs by discussing merely human nature? For though there are many, or rather countless, sorts of creatures, man is practically the only one that knows the use of fire, while all the others live and feed without it: they subsist, whether they range abroad or fly or crawl, upon roots or produce or flesh, all without fire; but without water no creature of the sea or land or air ever existed. For even flesh-eating animals, some of which Aristotle<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Historia Animal.</title> viii. 3 (601 b).</note> says do not drink, nevertheless keep alive by using the fluids in the flesh. That element, therefore, without which no living nature can subsist or endure is the more useful. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Let us pass from the people who use fire to the things that we use, namely plants and produce,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <q>This must be one of the most remarkable transitions in literature</q> (Sandbach, <foreign xml:lang="lat">op. cit.</foreign> p. 200).</note> of which some are completely devoid of heat, while others have an infinitesimal and uncertain amount. Moisture, however, is the element in nature that makes them all burgeon, growing and bearing fruit. And why should I enumerate honey and wine and oil and all the rest that come to us from the vintage, the milking of herds, or taking off of honey - and it is obvious where they belong<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, they must be classed as liquids.</note> - when even wheat itself, though it is classed as a dry food, moves into the category of liquids by alteration, fermentation, and deliquescence?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 968 a <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>; here, however, the author seems to be talking about beer.</note> </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">Moreover, what is never detrimental is more <pb xml:id="v.12.p.297"/> useful. Now fire, when it forms a stream, is most destructive; but the nature of water is never harmful. Then again, of two elements that is more beneficial which is cheaper and provides its help without any preparation. Now the use of fire requires a supply of fuel, for which reason rich people have more of it than poor, and kings than private persons; but water has another merit in service to man, that of equality, with no discrimination. For it needs no tools or implements, being a self-sufficient, self-fulfilling good. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">Then too, that which by multiplication destroys its own contribution is the less useful. Such a thing is fire which, like an all-devouring beast, consumes everything near, so that it is useful rather by skilful handling and craft and moderation in use than by its own nature; but water is never dangerous. Further, of two things the one which may be joined with its fellow is more useful. Now fire does not admit moisture and is of no use when in conjunction with it; but water is of service when combined with fire, for hot water is healing and well adapted to medicinal purposes. A watery fire you will never see; but water is as useful to mankind when hot as when cold. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">Furthermore, though there are but four elements,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 948 d above; in 729 b the sea is called the <q>naturally hostile element.</q> </note> water provides from itself a fifth, so to say, the sea, one no less beneficial than the others, especially for commerce among other things. This element, therefore, when our life was savage and unsociable, linked it together and made it complete, redressing defects by mutual assistance and exchange and so <pb xml:id="v.12.p.299"/> bringing about co-operation and friendship. Now Heraclitus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels-Kranz, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> i. 173, frag. B 99. In <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 98 c a fuller and more appropriate version is given; but see now H. Fränkel, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Wege und Formen</title>, p. 270 and n. 1.</note> declares, <q>If there were no sun, it would be perpetual night</q>; in the same way we may say that if there were no sea, man would be the most savage and destitute of all creatures. But as it is, the sea brought the Greeks the vine from India, from Greece transmitted the use of grain across the sea, from Phoenicia imported letters as a memorial against forgetfulness,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Euripides, frag. 578 (p. 542 Nauck).</note> thus preventing the greater part of mankind from being wineless, grainless, and unlettered. How, then, should water not be more useful when it has the advantage over fire of one more element?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For this delightful absurdity see Sandbach, <foreign xml:lang="lat">op. cit.</foreign> p. 199, n. 4.</note> </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">What could anyone find to say on the other side from this point on? This, that God, the master workman, had as material four elements from which to construct the universe. Among these, again, there is a simple mutual distinction, namely, that earth and water are a foundation at the bottom of the universe, being, like raw material, the substance of which things are constructed and moulded, having just so much form and organization, and indeed of capacity for growth and procreation, as is imparted to them by the other elements, air and fire, which are makers and artisans and rouse them, lying lifeless as they were until then, to the act of creation. Between these two, again, fire and air, there is the distinction that fire assumes the rule and leadership. This is clear by induction<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Possibly; but the argument hardly demonstrates this. The text is corrupt and a different solution than that adopted here is proposed by M. Adler (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Wien. Stud.</title> xxxi. 308).</note>: earth without warmth <pb xml:id="v.12.p.301"/> is barren and unfruitful, but fire, when it takes possession and inflames, causes it to swell to the point of generation; and it is impossible to find anyother reason why rocks and the bare bones of mountains are barren except that they have either no part at all, or very little share, in fire. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">And, in general, water is so far from being selfsufficient for the preservation or generation of other things that the want of fire is water’s destruction. For heat maintains everything in its proper being and keeps it in its proper substance, water itself as well as everything else. When fire withdraws and fails, water putrefies: the dearth of heat is the death and destruction of water. It is, of course, marsh waters and such as are stagnant, some too that have drained into depressions with no outlet, that are bad<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, <q>salt,</q> as, for example, the Dead Sea.</note> and finally putrefy<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 1129 d, 725 d; Athenaeus, 46 b-c.</note> because they have very little motion, which preserves everything by stirring up its heat. This is the reason why we commonly say that those waters are <q>living</q> which have most motion and the strongest current; the heat is maintained by their motion. How, then, should that not be the more useful of two things which has provided what is necessary for the other’s existence, as fire does for water? And surely that is the more useful, the lack of which, if it be entirely taken away, causes the living creature to die. For it is obvious that anything without which a creature cannot live must have been a necessary cause of its existence, while it did exist. Now even corpses have moisture which does not entirely vanish; otherwise dead bodies would not <pb xml:id="v.12.p.303"/> putrefy, since putrefaction is not a change from dry to moist, but rather a corruption of the moisture in flesh. Death, then, is nothing but the total disappearance of heat and so dead men are extremely cold; if you attack them with a razor-blade, you will blunt the edge of it through excess of cold. In the living creature itself, too, the parts that have the least heat are the least sensitive, like bones and hair and the parts that are a long way from the heart. And, in general, the presence of fire makes a greater difference<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Or adopting Schultz’s (<title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xlvi. 632) emendation: <q>the difference between living and non-living comes from the presence of fire</q>; but the text is hopelessly corrupt.</note> than that of moisture; for it is not mere moisture that produces plants and fruits, but warm moisture; cold water, of course, is either less productive or not productive at all. Yet if by its own nature water were fruitful, it would always bear fruit by itself b; but on the contrary it is even harmful. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">To begin again: for the use of fire as fire we do not need water; on the contrary, it would be in our way since it extinguishes and destroys it. But in most circumstances it is impossible to use water without fire. When water is heated, it is more useful; otherwise it is harmful. And it is heat which has made the sea more beneficial, its waters being warmer, since it differs from other waters in no other respect.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This sentence was transferred here from the following chapter by Wegehaupt.</note> So that of two things, that is better which of itself lends us its use without need of the other. Besides, <pb xml:id="v.12.p.305"/> water is solely beneficial to the touch, when you wash or bathe in it; but fire is profitable to all the senses. It can, in fact, both be touched and seen from a distance, so that in addition to its other uses, there is also its variegated character. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent"> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The order of the sentences in this chapter, in addition to its many other corruptions, has been badly disturbed.</note> For to say that man ever exists without fire is absurd, nor can he exist at all without it; but there are differences in kind as in other things. As for men who have no need of fire from without, they have this experience not because they do not need it, but because their own heat more than suffices. This must be predicated also of other animals which do not need fire.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This clause was transferred here by the editor from 958 c <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign> at the end of the paragraph.</note> So that in this respect, too, the use of fire is probably superior. Water is never in such a condition as to need no external support, but fire is self-sufficient because of its great excellence. As, then, a general is better who manages the affairs of his city so that it needs no allies from without, so also an element is superior which does not often need external assistance. </p> <p rend="indent"> Yet, to take the opposite point of view, that is more useful which we alone make great use of, since by the powers of our reason we are able to choose what is better. For what is more useful and more profitable to man than reason? But brute beasts do not have it. What then? Is what has been discovered by the foresight of our better part for this reason less useful? <pb xml:id="v.12.p.307"/> </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">And since we have arrived at this point in our argument: What is more profitable to life than Art? And it was fire that discovered and still preserves all the arts. That is why they make Hephaestus the first of artificers. Man has been granted but a little time to live and, as Ariston<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Von Arnim, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">S.V.F.</title> i. p. 90, frag. 403; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Aristotle, <title rend="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</title>, i. 13. 12 (1102 b 7).</note> says, sleep, like a taxcollector, takes away half of that. But I would rather say that it is a question of darkness; for although a man might stay awake all night, yet no good would come of his wakefulness if fire did not give him the benefits of day and remove the difference between day and night.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A very corrupt passage. Adler’s reconstruction (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Wien. Stud.</title> xxxi. 308), with additions by Post, has been followed.</note> If, then, there is nothing more advantageous to man than life and life is many times increased by fire, how should fire not be the most useful of all things? </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">And, to be sure, will not that be the most advantageous of which each of the senses has the greatest proportion? Do you not perceive, then, that there is no one of the senses which uses moisture by itself without an admixture of air or fire; and that every sense partakes of fire inasmuch as it supplies the vital energy; and especially that sight, the keenest of the physical senses,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title>, 250 d; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 654 d-e, 681 e.</note> is an ignited mass of fire<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> von Arnim, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">S.V.F.</title> ii, pp. 196, 199; but Post believes the words may mean <q>a chain of fire</q> linking the eye with its object.</note> and is that which has made us believe<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">It is the visible heavens and their fire that make us believe by <q>declaring the glory</q> of the celestial gods.
