					There seems to be no reason to discuss this little work
					in detail, since F. H. Sandbach<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Class. Quart.</hi> xxxiii (1939), pp. 198-202. G.

Still more might
					be added to his proofs, sound and thorough as they
					are ; but this is not the place to slay the slain. It is
					the more to be regretted that Ziegler, in the article
					on Plutarch in Pauly-Wissowa, <hi rend="italics">Realencyclopädie</hi>, has
					not had access to Sandbach's work,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This is very puzzling since Ziegler later (936) cites the same article as authoritative on rhythmical matters.</note> though he does
					refer to Xylander's athetesis, only to reject it, and
					might have mentioned Meziriacus' as well.
				</p>
            <p>
					Sandbach well observes : <q>To write an exercise
						on the comparative utility of fire and water may
						seem so difficult to us moderns who do not have such
						tasks as part of our education, that we do not recognize how badly the topic is here handled. . . . While
						it is possible that Plutarch wrote this work as a parody,
						or when a schoolboy, or under some strange circumstances, yet . . . the most probable view is that a
						miserable sophistical exercise on the subject <hi rend="italics">Whether
						fire or water is more useful</hi> was fathered on the author
						of a diversion entitled <hi rend="italics">Whether land- or water-animals
						aire more intelligent</hi>, just as the <hi rend="italics">Consolatio ad Apollonium</hi>
						
						            <pb n="v.12.p.289"/>
						
						was ascribed to the author of a consolation addressed
						to his wife, or the <hi rend="italics">Lives of the Ten Orators</hi> to the author
						of some more famous biographies.</q>

					The text is extremely bad, as may be seen by

					pp. 158-169- It is possible, to be sure, that part at
					least of the difficulty of the text is due to the author.
					Less emendation than that admitted here might not
					seriously damage what is irreparable nonsense in any
					case. Some attempt has been made to reproduce the

					not always useful; sometimes, indeed, we find it too

					That, of course, is the reason why the dead are called

					has often existed without fire, but without water
					never. Besides, that which, from the beginning,
					was coincidental with the inception of man is more
					useful than that which was discovered later ; for it
					is obvious that Nature bestowed the one as vitally
					necessary, while the other was brought to light by
					luck or contrivance for a superfluous use. Now, none
					may tell of a time when water was unknown to man,
					nor is any god or hero said to be its discoverer ; it
					was, in fact, at hand instantly when man appeared
					and was itself the cause of his appearance. But the
					use of fire, they say,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">As, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi>, Aeschylus, <hi rend="italics">Prometheus</hi>, 254. The following words in lozenge brackets are conjecturally supplied.</note> was discovered only a day or
					twro ago by Prometheus ; (consequently all our preceding life was deprived of) fire, though it was not
					without water. And that this is no poetic fiction is
					proved by present modes of living ; for there are
					certain races of man who live without fire, with no
					house or hearth, under the open sky. And Diogenes<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This anecdote is told with rather more point and relevance in 995 c-d <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note>
					the Cynic reduced the use of fire to a minimum, so
					that he even swallowed a squid raw, remarking,
					<q>Thus, gentlemen, do I risk my life for you.</q> But

         <div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="section">
            <p>And why do I split hairs by discussing merely

					the only one that knows the use of fire, while all the
					others live and feed without it: they subsist, whether
					they range abroad or fly or crawl, upon roots or produce or flesh, all without fire ; but without water no
					creature of the sea or land or air ever existed. For
					even flesh-eating animals, some of which Aristotle<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">

					destructive ; but the nature of water is never harmful.
					Then again, of two elements that is more beneficial
					which is cheaper and provides its help without any
					preparation. Now the use of fire requires a supply
					of fuel, for which reason rich people have more of
					it than poor, and kings than private persons ; but
					water has another merit in service to man, that of
					equality, with no discrimination. For it needs no
					tools or implements, being a self-sufficient, self-fulfilling good.

            <p>Then too, that which by multiplication destroys

					is fire which, like an all-devouring beast, consumes
					everything near, so that it is useful rather by skilful
					handling and craft and moderation in use than by
					its own nature ; but water is never dangerous.
					Further, of two things the one which may be joined
					with its fellow is more useful. Now fire does not admit
					moisture and is of no use when in conjunction with
					it; but water is of service when combined with fire,
					for hot water is healing and well adapted to medicinal
					purposes. A watery fire you will never see ; but
					water is as useful to mankind when hot as when cold.

					bringing about co-operation and friendship. Now

						be perpetual night</q> ; in the same way we may say
					that if there were no sea, man would be the most
					savage and destitute of all creatures. But as it is,
					the sea brought the Greeks the vine from India, from
					Greece transmitted the use of grain across the sea,

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Euripides, frag. 578 (p. 542 Nauck).</note> thus preventing the greater

					unlettered. How, then, should water not be more

            <p>What could anyone find to say on the other side
					from this point on ? This, that God, the master workman, had as material four elements from which to
					construct the universe. Among these, again, there
					is a simple mutual distinction, namely, that earth
					and water are a foundation at the bottom of the
					universe, being, like raw material, the substance of
					which things are constructed and moulded, having
					just so much form and organization, and indeed of
					capacity for growth and procreation, as is imparted
					to them by the other elements, air and fire, which
					are makers and artisans and rouse them, lying lifeless
					as they were until then, to the act of creation. Between these two, again, fire and air, there is the distinction that fire assumes the rule and leadership.
					This is clear by induction<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Possibly; but the argument hardly demonstrates this. The text is corrupt and a different solution than that adopted here is proposed by M. Adler (<hi rend="italics">Wien. Stud.</hi> xxxi. 308).</note>: earth without warmth

					is barren and unfruitful, but fire, when it takes

					at all, or very little share, in fire.

         </div>
         <div type="textpart" n="9" subtype="section">
            <p>And, in general, water is so far from being selfsufficient for the preservation or generation of other
					things that the want of fire is water's destruction.
					For heat maintains everything in its proper being and
					keeps it in its proper substance, water itself as well
					as everything else. When fire withdraws and fails,
					water putrefies : the dearth of heat is the death and
					destruction of water. It is, of course, marsh waters
					and such as are stagnant, some too that have drained
					into depressions with no outlet, that are bad<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">That is, <q>salt,</q> as, for example, the Dead Sea.</note> and
					finally putrefy<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Mor.</hi> 1129 d, 725 d; Athenaeus, 46 b-c.</note> because they have very little motion,
					which preserves everything by stirring up its heat.
					This is the reason why we commonly say that those
					waters are <q>living</q> which have most motion and
					the strongest current; the heat is maintained by
					their motion. How, then, should that not be the more
					useful of two things which has provided what is
					necessary for the other's existence, as fire does for
					water ? And surely that is the more useful, the lack
					of which, if it be entirely taken away, causes the
					living creature to die. For it is obvious that anything
					without which a creature cannot live must have been
					a necessary cause of its existence, while it did exist.
					Now even corpses have moisture which does not
					entirely vanish ; otherwise dead bodies would not
					
					<pb n="v.12.p.303"/>
					
					putrefy, since putrefaction is not a change from dry
					to moist, but rather a corruption of the moisture in
					flesh. Death, then, is nothing but the total disappearance of heat and so dead men are extremely cold ;
					if you attack them with a razor-blade, you will blunt
					the edge of it through excess of cold. In the living
					creature itself, too, the parts that have the least heat
					are the least sensitive, like bones and hair and the
					parts that are a long way from the heart. And, in
					general, the presence of fire makes a greater difference<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Or adopting Schultz's (<hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xlvi. 632) emendation: <q>the difference between living and non-living comes from the presence of fire</q>; but the text is hopelessly corrupt.</note> than that of moisture ; for it is not mere
					moisture that produces plants and fruits, but warm
					moisture ; cold water, of course, is either less productive or not productive at all. Yet if by its own
					nature water were fruitful, it would always bear fruit
					by itself b ; but on the contrary it is even harmful.

         <div type="textpart" n="10" subtype="section">
            <p>To begin again : for the use of fire as fire we
					do not need water ; on the contrary, it would be in
					our way since it extinguishes and destroys it. But
					in most circumstances it is impossible to use water
					without fire. When water is heated, it is more useful ;
					otherwise it is harmful. And it is heat which has
					made the sea more beneficial, its waters being warmer,
					since it differs from other waters in no other respect.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This sentence was transferred here from the following chapter by Wegehaupt.</note>

					water is solely beneficial to the touch, when you wash
					or bathe in it; but fire is profitable to all the senses.
					It can, in fact, both be touched and seen from a
					distance, so that in addition to its other uses, there
					is also its variegated character.

               <note resp="#ed" anchored="true">The order of the sentences in this chapter, in addition to its many other corruptions, has been badly disturbed.</note> For to say that man ever exists without fire
					is absurd, nor can he exist at all without it; but
					there are differences in kind as in other things. As
					for men who have no need of fire from without, they
					have this experience not because they do not need it,
					but because their own heat more than suffices. This
					must be predicated also of other animals which do
					not need fire.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This clause was transferred here by the editor from 958 c <hi rend="italics">infra</hi> at the end of the paragraph.</note> So that in this respect, too, the use
					of fire is probably superior. Water is never in such
					a condition as to need no external support, but fire
					is self-sufficient because of its great excellence. As,
					then, a general is better who manages the affairs of
					his city so that it needs no allies from without, so
					also an element is superior which does not often need
					external assistance.

            <p>
					Yet, to take the opposite point of view, that is more
					useful which we alone make great use of, since by
					the powers of our reason we are able to choose what
					is better. For what is more useful and more profitable
					to man than reason ? But brute beasts do not have
					it. What then ? Is what has been discovered by the
					foresight of our better part for this reason less useful ?
