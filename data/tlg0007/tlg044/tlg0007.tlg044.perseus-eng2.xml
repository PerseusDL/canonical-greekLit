<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamas, after an illustrious reign over the Lacedaemonians, left behind him a son, Agis, by Lampido, a woman of honourable family; and a much younger son, Agesilaüs, by Eupolia, the daughter of Melesippidas. The kingdom belonged to Agis by law, and it was thought that Agesilaüs would pass his life in a private station. He was therefore given the so-called <q type="foreign">agoge,</q> or course of public training in Sparta, which, although austere in its mode of life and full of hardships, educated the youth to obedience.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For this reason it was, we are told, that Simonides gave Sparta the epithet of <q type="soCalled">man-subduing,</q> since more than in any other state her customs made her citizens obedient to the laws and tractable, like horses that are broken in while yet they are colts. From this compulsory training the law exempts the heirs-apparent to the throne.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But Agesilaüs was singular in this also, that he had been educated to obey before he came to command. For this reason he was much more in harmony with his subjects than any of the kings; to the commanding and kingly traits which were his by nature there had been added by his public training those of popularity and kindliness. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>While he was among the so-called <q type="soCalled">bands</q> of boys who were reared together, he had as his lover Lysander<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 17.1"><title>Lycurgus</title>, xvii. 1</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Lys. 22.3"><title>Lysander</title>, xxii. 3</bibl>.</note>, who was smitten particularly with his native decorum. For although he was contentious and high-spirited beyond his fellows, wishing to be first in all things, and having a vehemence and fury which none could contend with or overwhelm, on the other hand he had such a readiness to obey and such gentleness, that he did whatever was enjoined upon him, not at all from a sense of fear, but always from a sense of honour, and was more distressed by censure than he was oppressed by hardships.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>As for his deformity, the beauty of his person in its youthful prime covered this from sight, while the ease and gaiety with which he bore such a misfortune, being first to jest and joke about himself, went far towards rectifying it. Indeed, his lameness brought his ambition into clearer light, since it led him to decline no hardship and no enterprise whatever. We have no likeness of him (for he himself would not consent to one, and even when he lay dying forbade the making of <q type="spoken">either statue or picture</q> of his person), but he is said to have been a little man of unimposing presence.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And yet his gaiety and good spirits in every crisis, and his raillery, which was never offensive or harsh either in word or look, made him more lovable, down to his old age, than the young and beautiful. But according to Theophrastus, Archidamus was fined by the ephors for marrying a little woman, <q type="spoken">For she will bear us,</q> they said, <q type="spoken">not kings, but kinglets.</q> </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>It was during the reign of Agis that Alcibiades came from Sicily as an exile to Sparta, and he had not been long in the city when he incurred the charge of illicit intercourse with Timaea, the wife of the king. The child, too, that was born of her, Agis refused to recognize as his own, declaring that Alcibiades was its father. Duris says that Timaea was not very much disturbed at this, but in whispers to her Helot maids at home actually called the child Alcibiades, not Leotychides; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>moreover that Alcibiades himself also declared that he had not approached Timaea out of wanton passion, but because he was ambitious to have the Spartans reigned over by his descendants.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Alc. 23.7"><title>Alcibiades</title>, xxiii. 7 f.</bibl> </note> On this account Alcibiades withdrew from Sparta, being in fear of Agis; and the boy was always an object of suspicion to Agis, and was not honoured by him as legitimate. But when the king lay sick, the supplications and tears of Leotychides prevailed upon him to declare him his son in the presence of many witnesses. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Notwithstanding this, after the death of Agis<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 398 B.C.</note>, Lysander, who by this time had subdued the Athenians at sea and was a man of the greatest influence in Sparta, tried to advance Agesilaüs to the throne, on the plea that Leotychides was a bastard and had no claim upon it. Many of the other citizens also, owing to the excellence of Agesilaüs and the fact that he had been reared with them under the common restraints of the public training, warmly espoused the plan of Lysander and co-operated with him. But there was a diviner in Sparta, named Diopeithes, who was well supplied with ancient prophecies, and was thought to be eminently wise in religious matters.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>This man declared it contrary to the will of Heaven that a lame man should be king of Sparta, and cited at the trial of the case the following oracle:—<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Bethink thee now, O Sparta, though thou art very glorious, lest from thee, sound of foot, there spring a maimed royalty; for long will unexpected toils oppress thee, and onward-rolling billows of man-destroying war.</l></quote></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>To this Lysander answered that, in case the Spartans stood in great fear of the oracle, they must be on their guard against Leotychides; for it mattered not to the god that one who halted in his gait should be king, but if one who was not lawfully begotten, nor even a descendant of Heracles, should be king, this was what the god meant by the <q type="emph">maimed royalty.</q> And Agesilaüs declared that Poseidon also had borne witness to the bastardy of Leotychides, for he had cast Agis forth from his bed-chamber by an earthquake, and after this more than ten months elapsed before Leotychides was born.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Alc. 23.8"><title>Alcibiades</title>, xxiii. 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Lys. 22.3"><title>Lysander</title>, xxii. 3 ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.3.2">Xenophon, <title>Hellenica</title>, iii. 3, 2</bibl>.</note> </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>In this way, and for these reasons, Agesilaüs was appointed king, and straightway enjoyed possession of the estates of Agis as well as his throne, after expelling Leotychides as a bastard. But seeing that his kinsmen on his mother’s side, though worthy folk, were excessively poor, he distributed among them the half of his estates, thereby making his inheritance yield him good-will and reputation instead of envy and hatred. As for Xenophon’s statement<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Xen. Ages. 6.4">Xenophon’s <title>Agesilaüs</title>, vi. 4.</bibl></note> that by obeying his country in everything he won very great power, so that he did what he pleased, the case is as follows. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>At that time the ephors and the senators had the greatest power in the state, of whom the former hold office for a year only, while the senators enjoy their dignity for life, their offices having been instituted to restrain the power of the kings, as I have said in my Life of Lycurgus.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 5.6">Chapters v. 6 f.</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 7.1">vii. 1 f.</bibl> </note> Therefore from the outset, and from generation to generation, the kings were traditionally at feud and variance with them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But Agesilaüs took the opposite course. Instead of colliding and fighting with them, he courted their favour, winning their support before setting out on any undertaking; and whenever he was invited to meet them, hastening to them on the run. If ever the ephors visited him when he was seated in his royal chair and administering justice, he rose in their honour; and as men were from time to time made members of the senate, he would send each one a cloak and an ox as a mark of honour. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Consequently, while he was thought to be honouring and exalting the dignity of their office, he was unawares increasing his own influence and adding to the power of the king a greatness which was conceded out of good-will towards him. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>In his dealings with the rest of the citizens he was less blame-worthy as an enemy than as a friend; for he would not injure his enemies without just cause, but joined his friends even in their unjust practices. And whereas he was ashamed not to honour his enemies when they did well, he could not bring himself to censure his friends when they did amiss, but actually prided himself on aiding them and sharing in their misdeeds. For he thought no aid disgraceful that was given to a friend. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But if, on the other hand, his adversaries stumbled and fell, he was first to sympathize with them and give them zealous aid if they desired it, and so won the hearts and the allegiance of all. The ephors, accordingly, seeing this, and fearing his power, laid a fine upon him, alleging as a reason that he made the citizens his own, who should be the common property of the state. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Natural philosophers are of the opinion that, if strife and discord should be banished from the universe, the heavenly bodies would stand still, and all generation and motion would cease in consequence of the general harmony. And so the Spartan law-giver seems to have introduced the spirit of ambition and contention into his civil polity as an incentive to virtue, desiring that good citizens should always be somewhat at variance and in conflict with one another, and deeming that complaisance which weakly yields without debate, which knows no effort and no struggle, to be wrongly called concord. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And some think that Homer also was clearly of this mind; for he would not have represented Agamemnon as pleased when Odysseus and Achilles were carried away into abuse of one another with <quote>frightful words,</quote><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.75"><title>Odyssey</title>, viii. 75 ff.</bibl> </note> if he had not thought the general interests likely to profit by the mutual rivalry and quarrelling of the chieftains. This principle, however, must not be accepted without some reservations; for excessive rivalries are injurious to states, and productive of great perils. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Agesilaüs had but recently come to the throne, when tidings were brought from Asia that the Persian king was preparing a great armament with which to drive the Lacedaemonians from the sea. Now, Lysander was eager to be sent again into Asia, and to aid his friends there. These he had left governors and masters of the cities, but owing to their unjust and violent conduct of affairs, they were being driven out by the citizens, and even put to death. He therefore persuaded Agesilaüs to undertake the expedition and make war in behalf of Hellas, proceeding to the farthest point across the sea, and thus anticipating the preparations of the Barbarian. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>At the same time he wrote to his friends in Asia urging them to send messengers to Sparta and demand Agesilaüs as their commander. Accordingly, Agesilaüs went before the assembly of the people and agreed to undertake the war if they would grant him thirty Spartans as captains and counsellors, a select corps of two thousand enfranchised Helots, and a force of allies amounting to six thousand. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>They readily voted everything, owing to the co-operation of Lysander, and sent Agesilaüs forth at once with the thirty Spartans. Of these Lysander was first and foremost, not only because of his own reputation and influence, but also because of the friendship of Agesilaüs, in whose eyes his procuring him this command was a greater boon than his raising him to the throne. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>While his forces were assembling at Geraestus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In the spring of 396 B.C.</note> Agesilaüs himself went to Aulis with his friends and spent the night. As he slept, he thought a voice came to him, saying: <q type="spoken">King of the Lacedaemonians, thou art surely aware that no one has ever been appointed general of all Hellas together except Agamemnon, in former times, and now thyself, after him. And since thou commandest the same hosts that he did, and wagest war on the same foes, and settest out for the war from the same place, it is meet that thou shouldst sacrifice also to the goddess the sacrifice which he made there before he set sail.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Almost at once Agesilaüs remembered the sacrifice of his own daughter<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Iphigeneia. Cf. <bibl n="Eur. IA 1540">Euripides, <title>Iph. Aul.</title>, 1540 ff. </bibl>(Kirchhoff).</note> which Agamemnon had there made in obedience to the soothsayers. He was not disturbed, however, but after rising up and imparting his vision to his friends, declared that he would honour the goddess with a sacrifice in which she could fitly take pleasure, being a goddess, and would not imitate the cruel insensibility of his predecessor. So he caused a hind to be wreathed with chaplets, and ordered his own seer to perform the sacrifice, instead of the one customarily appointed to this office by the Boeotians. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Accordingly, when the Boeotian magistrates heard of this, they were moved to anger, and sent their officers, forbidding Agesilaüs to sacrifice contrary to the laws and customs of the Boeotians. These officers not only delivered their message, but also snatched the thigh-pieces of the victim from the altar.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.4.3">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iii. 4, 3 f.</bibl> </note> Agesilaüs therefore sailed away in great distress of mind; he was not only highly incensed at the Thebans, but also full of ill-boding on account of the omen. He was convinced that his undertakings would be incomplete, and that his expedition would have no fitting issue. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As soon as he came to Ephesus, the great dignity and influence which Lysander enjoyed were burdensome and grievous to him. The doors of Lysander were always beset with a throng, and all followed in his train and paid him court, as though Agesilaüs had the command in name and outward appearance, to comply with the law, while in fact Lysander was master of all, had all power, and did everything.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.4.7">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iii. 4, 7.</bibl></note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>In fact, none of the generals sent out to Asia ever had more power or inspired more fear than he; none other conferred greater favours on his friends, or inflicted such great injuries upon his enemies. All this was still fresh in men’s minds, and besides, when they saw the simple, plain, and familiar manners of Agesilaüs, while Lysander retained the same Vehemence and harshness, and the same brevity of speech as before, they yielded to the latter’s influence altogether, and attached themselves to him alone. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>As a consequence of this, in the first place, the rest of the Spartans were displeased to find themselves assistants of Lysander rather than counsellors of the king; and, in the second place, Agesilaüs himself:, though he was not an envious man, nor displeased that others should be honoured, but exceedingly ambitious and high-spirited, began to fear that any brilliant success which he might achieve in his undertakings would be attributed to Lysander, owing to popular opinion. He went to work, therefore, in this way. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>To begin with, he resisted the counsels of Lysander, and whatever enterprises were most earnestly favoured by him, these he ignored and neglected, and did other things in their stead; again, of those who came to solicit favours from him, he sent away empty-handed all who put their chief confidence in Lysander; and in judicial cases likewise, all those against whom Lysander inveighed were sure to come off victorious, while, on the contrary, those whom he was manifestly eager to help had hard work even to escape being fined. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>These things happened, not casually, but as if of set purpose, and uniformly. At last Lysander perceived the reason, and did not hide it from his friends, but told them it was on his account that they were slighted, and advised them to go and pay their court to the king, and to those more influential with him than himself. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Accordingly, since his words and acts seemed contrived to bring odium upon the king, Agesilaüs, wishing to despite him still more, appointed him his carver of meats, and once said, we are told, in the hearing of many: <q type="spoken">Now then, let these suppliants go off to my carver of meats and pay their court to him.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Lysander, then, deeply pained, said to him: <q type="spoken">I see, Agesilaüs, that thou knowest very well how to humble thy friends.</q> <q type="spoken">Yes indeed,</q> said the king, <q type="spoken">those who wish to be more powerful than I am.</q> Then Lysander said: <q type="spoken">Well, perhaps these words of thine are fairer than my deeds. Give me, however, some post and place where I shall be of service to thee, without vexing thee.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Lys. 23.9"><title>Lysander</title>, xxiii. 9.</bibl></note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Upon this he was sent to the Hellespont, and brought over to Agesilaüs from the country of Pharnabazus, Spithridates, a Persian, with much money and two hundred horsemen. He did not, however, lay aside his wrath, but continued his resentment, and from this time on planned how he might wrest the kingdom from the two royal families, and make all Spartans once more eligible to it. And it was thought that he would have brought about a great disturbance in consequence of this quarrel, had not death overtaken him on his expedition into Boeotia.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Lys. 24.1"><title>Lysander</title>, xxiv.</bibl>-<bibl n="Plut. Lys. 28.1">xxviii.</bibl></note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Thus ambitious natures in a commonwealth, if they do not observe due bounds, work greater harm than good. For even though Lysander was troublesome, as he was, in gratifying his ambition unseasonably, still, Agesilaüs must surely have known another and more blameless way of correcting a man of high repute and ambition when he erred. As it was, it seems to have been due to the same passion that the one would not recognize the authority of his superior, nor the other endure the being ignored by his friend and comrade. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>At first Tisaphernes was afraid of Agesilaüs, and made a treaty in which he promised him to make the Greek cities free and independent of the King. Afterwards, however, when he was convinced that he had a sufficient force, he declared war, and Agesilaüs gladly accepted it. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For he had great expectations from his expedition, and he thought it would be a disgraceful thing if, whereas Xenophon and his Ten Thousand had penetrated to the sea, and vanquished the King just as often as they themselves desired, he, in command of the Lacedaemonians, who had the supremacy on sea and land, should perform no deed worthy of remembrance in the eyes of the Hellenes. At once, then, requiting the perjury of Tisaphernes with a righteous deception, he gave out word that he was going to lead his troops against Caria; but when the Barbarian had assembled his forces there, he set out and made an incursion into Phrygia. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>He captured many cities and made himself master of boundless treasure, thus showing plainly to his friends that the violation of a treaty is contempt for the gods, but that in outwitting one’s enemies there is not only justice, but also great glory, and profit mixed with pleasure. However, since he was inferior in cavalry and his sacrifices were unpropitious, he retired to Ephesus and began to get together a force of horsemen, commanding the well-to-do, in case they did not wish to perform military service themselves, to furnish instead every man a horse and rider. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>There were many who chose this course, and so it came to pass that Agesilaüs quickly had a large force of warlike horsemen instead of worthless men-at-arms.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.4.15">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iii. 4, 15.</bibl> </note> For those who did not wish to do military service hired those who did, and those who did not wish to serve as horsemen hired those who did. Indeed, Agesilaüs thought Agamemnon had done well in accepting a good mare and freeing a cowardly rich man from military service.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.296"><title>Iliad</title>, xxiii. 296 ff.</bibl></note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And once when, by his orders, his prisoners of war were stripped of their clothing and offered for sale by the venders of booty, their clothing found many purchasers, but their naked bodies, which were utterly white and delicate, owing to their effeminate habits, were ridiculed as useless and worthless.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>When the season again favoured an incursion into the enemy’s country,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In the spring of 395 B.C.; cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.4.16">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iii. 4, 16 ff.</bibl> </note> Agesilaüs gave out that he would march into Lydia, and this time he was not trying to deceive Tisaphernes. That satrap, however, utterly deluded himself, in that he disbelieved Agesilaüs because of his former trick, and thought that now, at any rate, the king would attack Caria, although it was ill-suited for cavalry, and he was far inferior in that arm of the service. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But Agesilaüs, as he had given out that he would do, marched into the plain of Sardis, and then Tisaphernes was forced to hasten thither from Caria with aid and relief; and riding through the plain with his cavalry, he cut off many straggling plunderers there. Agesilaüs, accordingly, reflecting that the enemy’s infantry had not yet come up, while his own forces were complete, made haste to give battle. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>He mingled his light-armed infantry with his horsemen, and ordered them to charge at full speed and assault the enemy, while he himself at once led up his men-at-arms. The Barbarians were put to flight, and the Greeks, following close upon them, took their camp and slew many of them. As a result of this battle, the Greeks could not only harry the country of the King without fear, but had the satisfaction of seeing due punishment inflicted upon Tisaphernes, an abominable man, and most hateful to the Greek race. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For the King at once sent Tithraustes after him, who cut off his head, and asked Agesilaüs to make terms and sail back home, offering him money at the hands of envoys. But Agesilaüs answered that it was for his city to make peace, and that for his own part, he took more pleasure in enriching his soldiers than in getting rich himself; moreover, the Greeks, he said, thought it honourable to take, not gifts, but spoils, from their enemies. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Nevertheless, desiring to gratify Tithraustes, because he had punished Tisaphernes, that common enemy of the Greeks, he led his army back into Phrygia, taking thirty talents from the viceroy to cover the expenses of the march. <milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>On the road he received a dispatch-roll from the magistrates at home, which bade him assume control of the navy as well as of the army.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.4.27">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iii. 4, 27 ff.</bibl> </note> This was an honour which no one ever received but Agesilaüs. And he was confessedly the greatest and most illustrious man of his time, as Theopompus also has somewhere said, although he prided himself more on his virtues than on his high command. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But in putting Peisander in charge of the navy at this time, he was thought to have made a mistake; for there were older and more competent men to be had, and yet he gave the admiralty to him, not out of regard for the public good, but in recognition of the claims of relationship and to gratify his wife, who was a sister of Peisander. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As for himself, he stationed his army in the province of Pharnabazus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In the fall of 395 B.C.; cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 4.1.1">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iv. 1, 1 ff.</bibl> </note>, where he not only lived in universal plenty, but also accumulated much money. He also advanced to the confines of Paphiagonia and brought Cotys, the king of the Paphlagonians, into alliance with him, for his virtues, and the confidence which he inspired, inclined the king to desire his friendship. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Spithridates also, from the time when he abandoned Pharnabazus and came to Agesilaüs, always accompanied him in his journeys and expeditions. Spithridates had a son, a very beautiful boy, named Megabates, of whom Agesilaüs was ardently enamoured, and a beautiful daughter also, a maiden of marriageable age. This daughter Agesilaüs persuaded Cotys to marry, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>and then receiving from him a thousand horsemen and two thousand targeteers, he retired again into Phrygia, and harassed the country of Pharnabazus, who did not stand his ground nor trust in his defences, but always kept most of his valued and precious things with him, and withdrew or fled from one part of the country to another, having no abiding place. At last Spithridates, who had narrowly watched him, in conjunction with Herippidas the Spartan,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The leader of the second company of thirty Spartan counsellors sent out in the spring of 395 B.C. Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.4.20">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iii. 4, 20.</bibl> </note> seized his camp and made himself master of all his treasures. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Here, however, Herippidas, who had too sharp an eye to the booty that was stolen, and forced the Barbarians to restore it, watching over and enquiring into everything, exasperated Spithridates, so that he marched off at once to Sardis with the Paphlagonians. <milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>This is said to have annoyed Agesilaüs beyond all else. For he was pained at the loss of a gallant man in Spithridates, and with him of a considerable force, and was ashamed to labour under the charge of pettiness and illiberality, from which he was always ambitious to keep not only himself, but also his country, pure and free. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And apart from these manifest reasons, he was irritated beyond measure by his love for the boy, which was now instilled into his heart, although when the boy was present he would summon all his resolution and strive mightily to battle against his desires. Indeed, when Megabates once came up and offered to embrace and kiss him, he declined his caresses. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>The boy was mortified at this, and desisted, and afterwards kept his distance when addressing him, whereupon Agesilaüs, distressed now and repentant for having avoided his kiss, pretended to wonder what ailed Megabates that he did not greet him with a kiss. <q type="spoken">It is thy fault,</q> the king’s companions said; <q type="spoken">thou didst not accept, but didst decline the fair one’s kiss in fear and trembling; yet even now he might be persuaded to come within range of thy lips; but see that thou dost not again play the coward.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Then, after some time spent in silent reflection, Agesilaüs said: <q type="spoken">There is no harm in your persuading him; for I think I would more gladly fight that battle of the kiss over again than possess all the gold I have ever seen.</q> Of such a mind was he while Megabates was with him, though when the boy was gone, he was so on fire with love for him that it were hard to say whether, had the boy come back into his presence, he would have had the strength to refuse his kisses.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After this, Pharnabazus desired to have a conference with him, and Apollophanes of Cyzicus, who was a guest-friend of both, brought the two together. Agesilaüs, with his friends, came first to the appointed place, and throwing himself down in a shady place where the grass was deep, there awaited Pharnabazus. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And when Pharnabazus came, although soft cushions and broidered rugs had been spread for him, he was ashamed to see Agesilaüs reclining as he was, and threw himself down likewise, without further ceremony, on the grassy ground, although he was clad in raiment of wonderful delicacy and dyes. After mutual salutations, Pharnabazus had plenty of just complaints to make, since, although he had rendered the Lacedaemonians many great services in their war against the Athenians, his territory was now being ravaged by them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But Agesilaüs, seeing the Spartans with him bowed to the earth with shame and at a loss for words (for they saw that Pharnabazus was a wronged man), said: <q type="spoken">We, O Pharnabazus, during our former friendship with the King, treated what belongs to him in a friendly way, and now that we have become his enemies, we treat it in a hostile way. Accordingly, seeing that thou also desirest to be one of the King’s chattels, we naturally injure him through thee.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">But from the day when thou shalt deem thyself worthy to be called a friend and ally of the Greeks instead of a slave of the King, consider this army, these arms and ships, and all of us, to be guardians of thy possessions and of thy liberty, without which nothing in the world is honourable or even worthy to be desired.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Upon this, Pharnabazus declared to him his purposes. <q type="spoken">As for me, indeed,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">if the King shall send out another general in my stead, I will be on your side; but if he entrusts me with the command, I will spare no efforts to punish and injure you in his behalf.</q> On hearing this, Agesilaüs was delighted, and said, as he seized his hand and rose up with him, <q type="spoken">O Pharnabazus, I would that such a man as thou might be our friend rather than our enemy.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As Pharnabazus and his friends were going away, his son, who was left behind, ran up to Agesilaüs and said with a smile: <q type="spoken">I make thee my guest-friend, Agesilaüs,</q> and offered him a javelin which he held in his hand. Agesilaüs accepted it, and being delighted with the fair looks and kindly bearing of the boy, looked round upon his companions to see if any one of them had anything that would do for a return-gift to a fair and gallant friend; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>and seeing that the horse of Idaeus, his secretary, had a decorated head-gear, he quickly took this off and gave it to the youth. Nor afterwards did he cease to remember him, but when, as time went on, the youth was robbed of his home by his brothers and driven into exile in Peloponnesus, he paid him much attention. He even gave him some assistance in his love affairs. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For the Persian was enamoured of an Athenian boy, an athlete, who, owing to his stature and strength, was in danger of being ruled out of the lists at Olympia. He therefore had recourse to Agesilaüs with entreaties to help the boy, and Agesilaüs, wishing to gratify him in this matter also, with very great difficulty and with much trouble effected his desires.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 4.1.39">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> iv. 1, 39 f.</bibl> </note> <milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>Indeed, although in other matters he was exact and law-abiding, in matters of friendship he thought that rigid justice was a mere pretext. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>At any rate, there is in circulation a letter of his to Hidrieus the Carian, which runs as follows: <q type="spoken">As for Nicias, if he is innocent, acquit him; if he is guilty, acquit him for my sake; but in any case acquit him.</q> Such, then, was Agesilaüs in most cases where the interests of his friends were concerned; but sometimes he used a critical situation rather for his own advantage. Of this he gave an instance when, as he was decamping in some haste and confusion, he left his favourite behind him sick. The sick one besought him loudly as he was departing, but he merely turned and said that it was hard to be compassionate and at the same time prudent. This story is related by Hieronymus the philosopher. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Agesilaüs had now been nearly two years in the field, and much was said about him in the interior parts of Asia, and a wonderful opinion of his self-restraint, of his simplicity of life, and of his moderation, everywhere prevailed. For when he made a journey, he would take up his quarters in the most sacred precincts by himself,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Ages. 5.7">Xenophon’s <title>Agesilaüs</title>, v. 7.</bibl> </note> thus making the gods overseers and witnesses of those acts which few men are permitted to see us perform; and among so many thousands of soldiers, one could hardly find a meaner couch than that of Agesilaüs; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>while to heat and cold he was as indifferent as if nature had given him alone the power to adapt himself to the seasons as God has tempered them. And it was most pleasing to the Greeks who dwelt in Asia to see the Persian viceroys and generals, who had long been insufferably cruel, and had revelled in wealth and luxury, now fearful and obsequious before a man who went about in a paltry cloak, and at one brief and laconic speech from him conforming themselves to his ways and changing their dress and mien, insomuch that many were moved to cite the words of Timotheus:—<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Ares is Lord; of gold Greece hath no fear.</l> </quote><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. Bergk, <title>Poet. Lyr. Graeci</title>, iii.4 p. 622.</note> </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Asia being now unsettled and in many quarters inclining to revolt, Agesilaüs set the cities there in order, and restored to their governments, without killing or banishing any one, the proper form. Then he determined to go farther afield, to transfer the war from the Greek sea, to fight for the person of the King and the wealth of Ecbatana and Susa, and above all things to rob that monarch of the power to sit at leisure on his throne, playing the umpire for the Greeks in their wars, and corrupting their popular leaders. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But at this point Epicydidas the Spartan came to him with tidings that Sparta was involved in a great war with other Greeks, and that the ephors called upon him and ordered him to come to the aid of his countrymen. <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O barbarous ills devised by Greeks!</l> </quote><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Eur. Tro. 766">Euripides, <title>Troades</title>, 766</bibl> (Kirchhoff).</note> How else can one speak of that jealousy which now leagued and arrayed the Greeks against one another? They laid violent hands on Fortune in her lofty flight, and turned the weapons which threatened the Barbarians, and War, which had at last been banished from Greece, back again upon themselves. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I certainly cannot agree with Demaratus the Corinthian, who said that those Greeks had missed a great pleasure who did not behold Alexander seated on the throne of Dareius, nay, I think that such might well have shed tears when they reflected that this triumph was left for Alexander and Macedonians by those who now squandered the lives of Greek generals on the fields of Leuctra, Coroneia, and Corinth, and in Arcadia. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Agesilaüs, however, never performed a nobler or a greater deed than in returning home as he now did, nor was there ever a fairer example of righteous obedience to authority. For Hannibal, though he was already in an evil plight and on the point of being driven out of Italy, could with the greatest difficulty bring himself to obey his summons to the war at home; and Alexander actually went so far as to jest when he heard of Antipater’s battle with Agis,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">At Megalopolis, in Arcadia, 331 B.C., Agis fell fighting, and the Spartan rebellion at once collapsed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Why, then, should we not call Sparta happy in the honour paid to her by Agesilaüs, and in his deference to her laws? No sooner had the dispatch-roll come to him than he renounced and abandoned the great good fortune and power already in his grasp, and the great hopes which beckoned him on, and at once sailed off <quote>with task all unfulfilled,</quote><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>For while approving himself a most excellent king and general, he showed himself a still better and more agreeable friend and companion to those who enjoyed his intimacy. Persian coins were stamped with the figure of an archer, and Agesilaüs said, as he was breaking camp, that the King was driving him out of Asia with ten thousand <q type="soCalled">archers</q>; for so much money had been sent to Athens and Thebes and distributed among the popular leaders there, and as a consequence those peoples made war upon the Spartans.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">According to Xenophon (<bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>And when he had crossed the Hellespont and was marching through Thrace,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Agesilaüs followed <quote>the very route taken by the Great King when he invaded Hellas</quote> (<bibl n="Xen.

All the rest, accordingly, received him as a friend and assisted him on his way, as they were severally able; but the people called Trallians, to whom even Xerxes gave gifts, as we are told, demanded of Agesilaüs as a price for his passage a hundred talents of silver and as many women. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But he answered them with scorn, asking why, then, they did not come at once to get their price; and marched forward, and finding them drawn up for battle, engaged them, routed them, and slew many of them. He sent his usual enquiry forward to the king of the Macedonians also, who answered that he would deliberate upon it. <q type="spoken">Let him deliberate, then,</q> said Agesilaüs, <q type="spoken">but we will march on.</q> In amazement therefore at his boldness, and in fear, the Macedonian king gave orders to let him pass as a friend. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Since the Thessalians were in alliance with his enemies, he ravaged their country. But to the city of Larissa he sent Xenocles and Scythes, hoping to secure its friendship. His ambassadors, however, were arrested and kept in close custody, whereupon the rest of his command were indignant, and thought that Agesilaüs ought to encamp about Larissa and lay siege to it. But he declared that the capture of all Thessaly would not compensate him for the loss of either one of his men, and made terms with the enemy in order to get them back. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And perhaps we need not wonder at such conduct in Agesilaüs, since when he learned that a great battle had been fought near Corinth,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">394 B.C.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>However, when the Pharsalians annoyed him and harassed his army, he ordered five hundred horsemen which he led in person to attack them, routed them, and set up a trophy at the foot of mount Narthacium.

He also sent for two divisions of the army at Corinth. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Then the Lacedaemonians at home, wishing to do him honour, made proclamation that any young man who wished might enlist in aid of the king.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Agesilaüs was naturally much distressed at these tidings, both because of the man thus lost, and of the city which had lost him; but nevertheless, that his soldiers might not be visited with dejection and fear as they were going into battle, he ordered the messengers from the sea to reverse their tidings and say that the Spartans were victorious in the naval battle.

Then, although the victory might have been his without peril if he had been willing to refrain from attacking the Thebans in front and to smite them in the rear after they had passed by, Agesilaüs was carried away by passion and the ardour of battle and advanced directly upon them, wishing to bear them down by sheer force. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>and when especially those who were at variance with Agesilaüs angrily asked Phoebidas by whose command he had done this thing, thereby turning suspicion upon Agesilaüs, he did not scruple to come to the help of Phoebidas, and to say openly that they must consider whether the act itself was serviceable or not; for that which was advantageous to Sparta might well be done independently, even if no one ordered it. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And yet in his discourse he was always declaring that justice was the first of the virtues; for valour was of no use unless justice attended it, and if all men should be just, there would be no need of valour.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And when, after the peace was concluded, the Great King sent him a letter proposing guest-friendship, he would not accept it, saying that the public friendship was enough, and that while that lasted there would be no need of a private one.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Of course this gave rise at once to a suspicion that while Phoebidas had done the deed, Agesilaüs had counselled it; and his subsequent acts brought the charge into general belief.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And Cleombrotus, who was king now that Agesipolis was dead, was sent into Boeotia with an army; for Agesilaüs, who had now borne arms for forty years, and was therefore exempt by law from military service, declined this command.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now, there was a certain Lacedaemonian named Sphodrias, of the party opposed to Agesilaüs, who had been appointed harmost at Thespiae. He lacked neither boldness nor ambition, but always abounded in hopes rather than in good judgement. This man, coveting a great name, and considering that Phoebidas had made himself famous far and near by his bold deed at Thebes, was persuaded that it would be a far more honourable and brilliant exploit for him to seize the Peiraeus on his own account and rob the Athenians of access to the sea, attacking them unexpectedly by land. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>It is said, too, that the scheme was devised by Pelopidas and Melo, chief magistrates at Thebes.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Their object was to embroil Athens and Sparta ( <bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For full daylight overtook him while he was yet in the Thriasian plain, although he had hoped to attack the Peiraeus by night. It is said also that his soldiers saw a light streaming from certain sanctuaries at Eleusis, and were filled with shuddering fear.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Hereupon men were sent from Athens to Sparta to denounce Sphodrias. They found, however, that the magistrates there had no need of their denunciation, but had already indicted Sphodrias on a capital charge. This charge he determined not to meet, fearing the wrath of his countrymen, who were ashamed in the presence of the Athenians, and wished to be thought wronged with them, that they might not be thought wrongdoers with Sphodrias. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Now Sphodrias had a son, Cleonymus, who was still a boy and fair to look upon, and of whom Archidamus, the son of King Agesilaüs, was enamoured. In this crisis Archidamus naturally sympathized with his favourite because of the peril in which his father stood, but he was unable to aid and assist him openly, since Sphodrias was one of the opponents of Agesilaüs. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But when Cleonymus came to him in tears and begged him to mollify Agesilaüs, from whom he and his father had most to fear, for three or four days he was restrained by awe and fear from saying anything to Agesilaüs as he followed him about; but finally, when the trial was near at hand, he plucked up courage to tell him that Cleonymus had begged him to intercede for his father. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now Agesilaüs, although he knew of the love of Archidamus, had not put a stop to it, since Cleonymus, from his early boyhood, had given special promise of becoming an earnest and worthy man. At this time, however, he did not permit his son to expect any advantage or kindness in answer to his prayer; he merely said, as he went away, that he would consider what was the honourable and fitting course in the matter. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Archidamus was therefore mortified, and ceased to visit Cleonymus, although before this he had done so many times a day. As a consequence, the friends of Sphodrias also were more in despair of his case, until Etymocles, one of the friends of Agesilaüs, conferred with them and disclosed the mind of the king, namely, that he blamed to the utmost what Sphodrias had done, but yet thought him a brave man, and saw that the city needed just such soldiers. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For this was the way in which Agesilaüs always spoke about the trial, in his desire to gratify his son, so that Cleonymus was at once aware of the zealous efforts of Archidamus in his behalf, and the friends of Sphodrias had courage at last to come to his help. It is a fact also that Agesilaüs was excessively fond of his children, and a story is told of his joining in their childish play. Once, when they were very small, he bestrode a stick, and was playing horse with them in the house, and when he was spied doing this by one of his friends, he entreated him not to tell any one, until he himself should be a father of children. </p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Besides, when he saw that his colleague Cleombrotus was little inclined to make war upon the Thebans, he waived the exemption by law which he had formerly claimed in the matter of the expedition, and presently led an incursion into Boeotia himself,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">According to Xenophon (<bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For the Thebans are said to have been really more warlike at this time than ever before, owing to the many expeditions which the Lacedaemonians made against them, by which they were virtually schooled in arms.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Accordingly, they said they had no wish to be dragged hither and thither to destruction every year, they themselves so many, and the Lacedaemonians, with whom they followed, so few.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Then his herald called upon the potters to stand up first, and after them the smiths, next, the carpenters in their turn, and the builders, and so on through all the handicrafts.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And when Epaminondas answered again in the same way by asking whether he intended to make the cities of Laconia independent, Agesilaüs became violent and was glad of the pretext for at once erasing the name of the Thebans from the treaty of peace and declaring war upon them.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">According to Xenophon (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.3.19"><title>Hell.</title> vi. 3, 19.</bibl>), who makes no mention of Epaminondas, the Thebans had signed as Thebans, but on the next day wished to substitute Boeotians for Thebans. This Agesilaüs refused to permit. It would have recognized the supremacy of Thebes in Boeotia.</note> The rest of the Greeks, however, he ordered to depart, now that they were reconciled with each other, leaving differences which could be healed to the terms of peace, and those which could not, to war, since it was a hard task to settle and remove all their disputes. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>At this time Cleombrotus was in Phocis with an army. The ephors therefore immediately sent him orders to lead his forces against Thebes. They also sent round a summons for an assembly of their allies, who were without zeal for the war and thought it a great burden, but were not yet bold enough to oppose or disobey the Lacedaemonians. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And although many baleful signs appeared, as I have written in my Life of Epaminondas,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Not extant.</note> and though Prothouüs the Laconian made opposition to the expedition, Agesilaüs would not give in, but brought the war to pass. He thought that since all Hellas was on their side, and the Thebans had been excluded from the treaty, it was a favourable time for the Spartans to take vengeance on them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>But the time chosen for it proves that this expedition was made from anger more than from careful calculation. For the treaty of peace was made at Lacedaemon on the fourteenth of the month Scirophorion, and on the fifth of Hecatombaeon the Lacedaemonians were defeated at Leuctra,—an interval of twenty days. In that battle a thousand Lacedaemonians fell, besides Cleombrotus the king, and around him the mightiest of the Spartans. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Among these, they say, was Cleonymus, the beautiful son of Sphodrias,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Now that the Lacedaemonians had met with an unexpected reverse, and the Thebans with an unlooked-for success surpassing that of any other Hellenes at strife with Hellenes, the high conduct of the defeated city was no less to be envied and admired than that of the victorious city. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Xenophon says<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Xen.

The city was holding a festival and was full of strangers; for the <q type="foreign">gymnopaediae</q> were in progress and choirs of boys were competing with one another in the theatre; then came the messengers of calamity from Leuctra. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But the ephors, although it was at once apparent that their cause was ruined and their supremacy lost, would not allow a choral performance to be omitted, nor the fashion of the festival to be changed by the city, but after sending the names of the slain warriors to the homes of their kindred, they themselves conducted the spectacle and the choral contests to a close. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>On the next morning also, now that everyone knew who had survived the battle and who had been slain, the fathers and kindred and friends of the slain went down into the market-place and greeted one another with bright faces, full of pride and exultation; while the friends of the survivors, as if in mourning, tarried at home with the women, and if one of them was obliged to appear in public, his garb and speech and looks betokened his humiliation and abasement.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>The greater number, however, when their allies were falling away from them and it was expected that Epaminondas, in all the pride of a conqueror, would invade Peloponnesus, fell to thinking of the oracles,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Ages. 3.4">chapter iii. 4 f.</bibl> </note> in view of the lameness of Agesilaüs, and were full of dejection and consternation in respect to the divine powers, believing that their city was in an evil plight because they had dethroned the sound-footed king and chosen instead a lame and halting one,—the very thing which the deity was trying to teach them carefully to avoid. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And yet otherwise he had such power and valour and fame that they not only continued to employ him as king and general in matters pertaining to war, but also as physician and arbiter in their civil perplexities. For instance, upon those who had shown cowardice in the battle, whom they themselves call <q type="foreign">tresantes,</q> or <gloss>run-aways</gloss>, they hesitated to inflict the disabilities required by the laws, since the men were numerous and powerful, for fear that they might stir up a revolution. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For such men are not only debarred from every office, but intermarriage with any of them is a disgrace, and any one who meets them may strike them if he pleases.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>It was a serious matter, therefore, to allow many such men in the city, when she lacked not a few soldiers. So they chose Agesilaüs as a law-giver for the occasion. And he, without adding to or subtracting from or changing the laws in any way, came into the assembly of the Lacedaemonians and said that the laws must be allowed to sleep for that day, but from that day on must be in sovereign force. By this means he at once saved the laws for the city and the men from infamy. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Then, wishing to remove the discouragement and dejection which prevailed among the young men, he made an incursion into Arcadia,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 370 B.C. (<bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After this,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In the same year, after Agesilaüs had returned and disbanded his forces.</note> Epaminondas entered Laconia with his allies, having no fewer than forty thousand men-at-arms. Many light armed and unarmed troops also followed him for the sake of plunder, so that a horde of seventy thousand, all told, made this incursion into Laconia. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For a period of no less than six hundred years the Dorians had been living in Lacedaemon, and this was the first time in all that period that enemies had been seen in the country; before this, none had ventured there. But now they burst into an unravaged and inviolate land, and burned and plundered as far as the river and the city, and no one came out against them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For Agesilaüs would not suffer the Lacedaemonians to fight against such a <quote>billowy torrent of war,</quote> to use the words of Theopompus, but surrounded the central and most commanding parts of the city with his men-at-arms, while he endured the boastful threats of the Thebans, who called upon him by name and bade him come out and fight for his country, since he had caused her misfortunes by lighting up the flames of war. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>But this was not the worst. Agesilaüs was still more harassed by the tumults and shrieks and running about throughout the city, where the elder men were enraged at the state of affairs, and the women were unable to keep quiet, but were utterly beside themselves when they heard the shouts and saw the fires of the enemy.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><quote>The women could not endure even the sight of the smoke, since they had never set eyes upon an enemy</quote> (<bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>He was also distressed at the thought of what his fame would be, because he had taken command of the city when she was greatest and most powerful, and now saw her reputation lowered, and her proud boast made empty, which boast he himself also had often made, saying that no Spartan woman had ever seen the smoke of an enemy’s fires. It is said also that Antalcidas, when an Athenian was disputing with him over the valour of the two peoples and said, <q type="spoken">Yet we have often driven you away from the Cephisus,</q> replied: <q type="spoken">But we have never driven you away from the Eurotas.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And a similar retort was made by a Spartan of lesser note to the Argive who said, <q type="spoken">Many of you lie buried in the lands of Argos</q>; the Spartan answered: <q type="spoken">But not a man of you in the lands of Laconia.</q> </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Now, however, they say that Antalcidas, who was an ephor, secretly sent his children away to Cythera, so full of fear was he. But Agesilaüs, when the enemy tried to cross the Eurotas and force their way to the city, abandoned the rest of it and drew up his forces in front of its central and lofty precincts. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Now, the Eurotas at this time was flowing at its fullest and deepest, since snows had fallen, and its current, even more from its coldness than its violence, was very troublesome to the Thebans. As Epaminondas was fording it at the head of his phalanx, certain ones pointed him out to Agesilaüs, and he, we are told, after fixing his gaze upon him and watching him for a long time, said but these words: <q type="spoken">O adventurous man!</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Epaminondas was ambitious to join battle in the city and set up a trophy of victory there, but since he could neither force nor tempt Agesilaüs out of his positions, he withdrew and began to ravage the country. Meanwhile, about two hundred of the Lacedaemonians who had long been disaffected and mutinous banded together and seized the Issorium, where the temple of Artemis stands, a well-walled and inaccessible spot. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>The Lacedaemonians wished to make a dash upon them at once, but Agesilaüs, fearing their insurrection, ordered the rest to keep quiet, while he himself, wearing his cloak and attended by a single servant, went towards them, crying out that they had misunderstood his orders; for he had not commanded them to assemble in that place, nor in a body, but some yonder (pointing to another spot), and some in another part of the city. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>They were delighted to hear this, supposing that their design was undiscovered, and, breaking up, went off to the places which he ordered them to occupy. Then Agesilaüs at once summoned other troops and took possession of the Issorium, after which he arrested about fifteen of the conspirators who had been gathered there, and put them to death in the night. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>He was also informed of another and a larger conspiracy of Spartans, who met secretly in a house and there plotted revolution. It was impracticable either to bring these men to trial in a time of so much confusion, or to overlook their plots. Accordingly, Agesilaüs conferred with the ephors, and then put these men also to death without process of law, although no Spartan had ever before met with such a death. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>At this time, also, many of the provincials and Helots who had been enrolled in the army ran away from the city and joined the enemy, and this caused very deep discouragement. Agesilaüs therefore instructed his servants to go every morning before it was light to the barracks and take the arms of the deserters and hide them, that their numbers might not be known. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>As for the reason why the Thebans withdrew from Laconia, most writers say that it was because winter storms came on and the Arcadians began to melt away and disband; others, because they had remained there three entire months and thoroughly ravaged most of the country;<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">All three reasons are given by Xenophon (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.5.50"><title>Hell.</title> vi. 5. 50</bibl>).</note> but Theopompus says that when the Theban chief magistrates had already determined to take their army back, Phrixus, a Spartan, came to them, bringing ten talents from Agesilaüs to pay for their withdrawal, so that they were only doing what they had long ago decided to do, and had their expenses paid by their enemies besides. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>This story may be true, although I know not how all other writers could be ignorant of it, while Theopompus alone heard it; but, at any rate, all agree that the salvation of Sparta at this time was due to Agesilaüs, because he renounced his inherent passions of contentiousness and ambition, and adopted a policy of safety. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>He could not, however, restore the power and reputation of his city after its fall, for it was like a human body that is sound, indeed, but has followed all the while too strict and severe a regimen; a single error turned the scale and brought down the entire prosperity of the city. Nor was this strange. For to a civil polity best arranged for peace and virtue and unanimity they had attached empires and sovereignties won by force, not one of which Lycurgus thought needful for a city that was to live in happiness; and therefore they fell. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Agesilaüs himself now declined military service on account of his years, but Archidamus his son, with assistance which came from the tyrant of Sicily,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Dionysius the Elder.</note> conquered the Arcadians in the so-called <q type="soCalled">tearless battle,</q> where not one of his own men fell, and he slew great numbers of the enemy.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 368 B.C. (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 7.1.28">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> vii. 1, 28-32</bibl>).</note> This victory, more than anything else, showed the weakness of the city. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For up to this time they were wont to think the conquest of their enemies so customary and natural a thing for them to achieve, that no sacrifice for victory was offered in the city to the gods, beyond that of a cock, neither did the winners of the contest exult, nor those who heard of their victory show great joy. Nay, even after the battle at Mantinea,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 418 B.C., when the Lacedaemonians defeated an allied force of Mantineans, Argives, and Athenians (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.64">Thucydides, v. 64-75</bibl>).</note> which Thucydides has described, the one who first announced the victory had no other reward for his glad tidings than a piece of meat sent by the magistrates from the public mess. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>But now, at the news of the Arcadian victory and at the approach of Archidamus, no one could restrain himself, but first his father went to meet him, weeping for joy, and after him the chief magistrates, while the elderly men and the women went down in a throng to the river, lifting their hands to heaven and blessing the gods, as if Sparta had wiped away her unmerited disgraces and now saw the light shine bright again as of old; for before this, we are told, her men could not so much as look their wives in the face, out of shame at their disasters. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>But when Messene was built by Epaminondas, and its former citizens flocked into it from all quarters,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 369 B.C.</note> the Spartans had not the courage to contest the issue nor the ability to hinder it, but cherished the deepest resentment against Agesilaüs, because a country which was not of less extent than their own, which stood first among Hellenic lands for its fertility, the possession and fruits of which they had enjoyed for so long a time, had been lost by them during his reign. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For this reason, too, Agesilaüs would not accept the peace which was proffered by the Thebans. He was not willing to give up to them formally the country which was actually in their power, and persisted in his opposition. As a consequence, he not only did not recover Messenia, but almost lost Sparta besides, after being outgeneralled. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For when the Mantineans changed their allegiance,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 362 B.C.</note> revolted from Thebes, and called in the Lacedaemonians to help them, Epaminondas, learning that Agesilaüs had marched out from Sparta with his forces and was approaching, set out by night from Tegea, without the knowledge of the Mantineans, and led his army against Sparta itself. He passed by Agesilaüs, and came within a little of suddenly seizing the city in a defenceless state.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><quote>Like a nest of young birds utterly bereft of its natural defenders</quote> (<bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>But Euthynus, a Thespian, as Callisthenes says, or, according to Xenophon,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For he did not think, as on a former occasion, that the crisis demanded safe and cautious measures, but rather deeds of desperate daring. In these he had never put confidence before, nor had he employed them, but then it was only by their aid that he repelled the danger, snatching the city out of the grasp of Epaminondas, erecting a trophy of victory, and showing their wives and children that the Lacedaemonians were making the fairest of all returns to their country for its rearing of them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Archidamus, too, fought among the foremost, conspicuous for his impetuous courage and for his agility, running swiftly through the narrow streets to the endangered points in the battle, and everywhere pressing hard upon the enemy with his few followers.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 7.5.12">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> vii. 5, 12-14.</bibl> </note> But I think that Isidas, the son of Phoebidas, must have been a strange and marvellous sight, not only to his fellow-citizens, but also to his enemies. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>He was of conspicuous beauty and stature, and at an age when the human flower has the greatest charm, as the boy merges into the man. Naked as he was, without either defensive armour or clothing,—for he had just anointed his body with oil,—he took a spear in one hand, and a sword in the other, leaped forth from his house, and after pushing his way through the midst of the combatants, ranged up and down among the enemy, smiting and laying low all who encountered him. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And no man gave him a wound, whether it was that a god shielded him on account of his valour, or that the enemy thought him taller and mightier than a mere man could be.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>A few days afterwards a battle was fought near Mantinea, in which Epaminondas had already routed the van of the Lacedaemonians, and was still eagerly pressing on in pursuit of them,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 7.5.22">Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> vii. 5, 22-24.</bibl> </note> when Anticrates, a Spartan, faced him and smote him with a spear, as Dioscorides tells the story; but the Lacedaemonians to this day call the descendants of Anticrates <q type="foreign">machaeriones,</q> or <gloss>swordsmen</gloss>, because he used a sword for the blow. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For the Lacedaemonians were filled with such admiring love for him because of the fear in which they held Epaminondas while living, that they voted honours and gifts to Anticrates himself, and to his posterity exemption from taxes, an immunity which in my own day also is enjoyed by Callicrates, one of the descendants of Anticrates. <milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>After the battle and the death of Epaminondas, when the Greeks concluded peace among themselves, Agesilaüs and his partisans tried to exclude the Messenians from the oath of ratification, on the ground that they had no city. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And when all the rest admitted the Messenians and accepted their oaths, the Lacedaemonians held aloof from the peace, and they alone remained at war in the hope of recovering Messenia.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Diod. 15.89.1">Diodorus, xv. 89, 1 f.</bibl> </note> Agesilaüs was therefore deemed a headstrong and stubborn man, and insatiable of war, since he did all in his power to undermine and postpone the general peace, and again since his lack of resources compelled him to lay burdens on his friends in the city and to take loans and contributions from them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And yet it was his duty to put an end to their evils, now that opportunity offered, and not, after having lost Sparta’s whole empire, vast as it was, with its cities and its supremacy on land and sea, then to carry on a petty struggle for the goods and revenues of Messene. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="36">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>He lost still more reputation by offering to take a command under Tachos the Egyptian. For it was thought unworthy that a man who had been judged noblest and best in Hellas, and who had filled the world with his fame, should furnish a rebel against the Great King, a mere Barbarian, with his person, his name, and his fame, and take money for him, rendering the service of a hired captain of mercenaries.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon (<bibl n="Xen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Agesilaüs, however, paid no heed to these considerations, nor did he think any public service beneath his dignity; it was more unworthy of him, in his opinion, to live an idle life in the city, and to sit down and wait for death. Therefore he collected mercenaries with the money which Tachos sent him, embarked them on transports, and put to sea, accompanied by thirty Spartan counsellors, as formerly.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>But when they saw no brilliant array whatever, but an old man lying in some grass by the sea, his body small and contemptible, covered with a cloak that was coarse and mean, they were moved to laughter and jesting, saying that here was an illustration of the fable, <q type="spoken">a mountain is in travail, and then a mouse is born.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In <bibl n="Ath. 14.616d">Athenaeus p. 616 d</bibl>, it is Tachos himself who makes this jest upon Agesilaüs, who replies in anger: <q type="spoken">Some day you will think me a lion.</q></note></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>After these words, he sent men to Sparta who were to denounce Tachos, and commend Nectanabis. Tachos and Nectanabis also sent and besought the support of the Lacedaemonians, the former on the ground that he had long been their ally and friend, the latter on the plea that he would be well disposed to their city and more eager to promote her interests. The Lacedaemonians, accordingly, after hearing the messengers, made public answer to the Egyptians that Agesilaüs would attend to these matters; but to Agesilaüs they wrote privately bidding him see to it that the interests of Sparta should not suffer. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>So Agesilaüs took his mercenaries and went over from Tachos to Nectanabis, making the interests of his country serve as a veil for a strange and unnatural proceeding, since when this pretext was removed, the most fitting name for his act was treachery.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, who can see no fault in Agesilaüs, says (<bibl n="Xen. Ages. 2.31"><title>Agesilaüs</title>, ii. 31</bibl>): <quote>Accordingly, he chose between the two that one who seemed to be the truer partisan of Hellas, and with him marched against the enemy of Hellas and conquered him in battle.</quote></note> But the Lacedaemonians assign the chief place in their ideas of honour to the interests of their country, and neither learn nor understand any other justice than that which they think will enhance the glory of Sparta. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="38">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Tachos, accordingly, thus deserted by his mercenaries, took to flight. But in Mendes another rival rose up against Nectanabis and was proclaimed king, and after collecting a hundred thousand men advanced against him. Then Nectanabis sought to encourage Agesilaüs by saying that although the enemy were numerous, they were a mixed rabble of artisans whose inexperience in war made them contemptible. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><q type="spoken">Indeed,</q> said Agesilaüs, <q type="spoken">it is not their numbers that I fear, but the inexperience and ignorance of which you speak, which it is hard to overcome by stratagems. For stratagems array unexpected difficulties against men who try to defend themselves against them, if they suspect and await them; but he who does not await nor even suspect any stratagem gives no hold to the opponent who is trying to outwit him, just as, in a wrestling bout, he who does not stir gives no advantage to his antagonist.</q> After this, the Mendesian also sent and tried to win over Agesilaüs. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Nectanabis was therefore alarmed, and when Agesilaüs urged him to fight the issue out as speedily as possible, and not to wage a war of delays against men who were inexperienced in fighting, but were numerous enough to surround him and hedge him in and anticipate and get the start of him in many ways, he grew still more suspicious and fearful of him, and retired into a city which was well fortified and had a large compass. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Agesilaüs was incensed at this lack of confidence, and full of indignation, but since he was ashamed to change sides again and finally go back home without accomplishing any thing, he accompanied Nectanabis and entered the city with him. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="39">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>But when the enemy came up and began to surround the city with a trench, then the Egyptian changed his mind, grew fearful of the siege, and wished to give battle, for which the Greeks also were very eager, since there were no provisions in the place. Agesilaüs, however, would not permit it, but opposed it, and was therefore maligned by the Egyptians even more bitterly than before, and called a betrayer of the king. But he bore their calumnies more patiently now, and sought to find the fitting moment for his stratagem. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>This was as follows. The enemy were digging a deep trench outside around the city, in order to shut its occupants up completely. Accordingly, when the trench had been carried almost around the city, and its ends were near one another, after waiting for evening to come and ordering the Greeks to arm themselves, Agesilaüs went to the Egyptian and said: <q type="spoken">Now is the time, young man, for us to save ourselves, and I would not speak of it until it came, for fear of vitiating it.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">The enemy have now worked out our safety with their own hands. They have dug their trench so far that the part which is finished hinders them from attacking us in great numbers, and the space between the ends gives us room to fight them on fair and equal terms. Come, then, be eager to show yourself a brave man; follow with us as we charge, and save yourself and your army too.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">For the enemy in our front will not withstand us, and the rest will not harm us because of the trench.</q> Nectanabis, then, was filled with admiration for the sagacity of Agesilaüs, and putting himself in the centre of the Greek array, charged forwards and easily routed his opponents. And now that Agesilaüs had won back the confidence of Nectanabis, he brought the same stratagem to bear again upon the enemy, like a trick in wrestling. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>By sometimes pretending to retreat and fly, and sometimes attacking them on the flanks, he drove their whole multitude into a tract which had a deep canal full of water on either side. The space between these he occupied and stopped up with the head of his column, and so made his numbers equal to those of the enemy who could fight with him, since they were unable to surround and enclose him. Therefore after a short resistance they were routed; many were slain, and the fugitives were dispersed and melted away.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The account of this Egyptian campaign in <bibl n="Diod. 15.93">Diodorus, xv. 93</bibl>, differs in many details.</note> </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After this, the Egyptian succeeded in establishing himself firmly and securely in power, and showed his friendliness and affection by begging Agesilaüs to remain and spend the winter with him. But Agesilaüs was eager to return to the war at home, knowing that his city needed money and was hiring mercenaries. He was therefore dismissed with great honour and ceremony, taking with him, besides other honours and gifts, two hundred and thirty talents of silver for the war at home. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But since it was now winter, he kept close to shore with his ships, and was borne along the coast of Libya to an uninhabited spot called the Harbour of Menelaüs. Here he died, at the age of eighty-four years. He had been king of Sparta forty-one years, and for more than thirty of these he was the greatest and most influential of all Hellenes, having been looked upon as leader and king of almost all Hellas, down to the battle of Leuctra. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>It was Spartan custom, when men of ordinary rank died in a foreign country, to give their bodies funeral rites and burial there, but to carry the bodies of their kings home. So the Spartans who were with Agesilaüs enclosed his dead body in melted wax, since they had no honey, and carried it back to Lacedaemon. The kingdom devolved upon Archidamus his son, and remained in his family down to Agis, who was slain by Leonidas<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 240 B.C.
