<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head><p rend="indent"> Plutarch’s essay on the <title rend="italic">Fortune of the Romans</title>, like the following essays, is very plainly an epideictic oration. Where and when it was delivered, or whether it was ever delivered at all, we have no means of ascertaining. Hartman feels very sure that it was delivered to a Roman audience in the early days of Plutarch’s sojourn at Rome, and was intended to commend the speaker to other Romans besides his personal friends there. </p><p rend="indent">The thesis that Fortune was responsible for the great Roman empire would hardly be pleasing to Romans, but Plutarch is careful to point out that the high character of many individual Romans also contributed to the Roman success. In fact the essay might well bear the double title of <title rend="italic">Fortune or Virtues</title>,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This name it actually does bear in seven (out of a total of about twenty-six) mss.</note> as does the essay on Alexander. Plutarch was thoroughly familiar with the interpretations of Roman history then fashionable, and in this essay he gives a colourful sketch of as much as will serve his purpose. Much that is here may also be found elsewhere in Plutarch’s writings. </p><p rend="indent">The essay comes to a somewhat abrupt conclusion, and many have thought it unfinished; the same is true of the essays immediately following. One may <pb xml:id="v.4.p.321"/> wonder whether a time limit was set for these orations, as in the courts at Athens where the time allowed was measured by the water-clock or clepsydra. We may note, however, that these orations are of quite unequal length. </p><p rend="indent">The text is fairly good, and the majority of the ms. mistakes have been corrected by the various editors and commentators. The essay is No. 175 in Lamprias’s list of Plutarch’s works. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.323"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Virtue and Fortune, who have often engaged in many great contests, are now engaging each other in the present contest, which is the greatest of all; for in this they are striving for a decision regarding the hegemony of Rome, to determine whose work it is and which of them created such a mighty power. For to her who is victorious this will be no slight testimonial, but rather a defence against accusation. For Virtue is accused of being a fair thing, but unprofitable; Fortune of being a thing inconstant, but good. Virtue’s labours, they say, are fruitless. Fortune’s gifts untrustworthy. Who, then, will not declare, when Rome shall have been added to the achievements of one of the contestants, either that Virtue is a most profitable thing if she has done such good to good men, or that Good Fortune is a thing most steadfast if she has already preserved for so long a time that which she has bestowed? </p><p rend="indent">The poet Ion<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 717 b.</note> in his prose works observes that Fortune is a thing very dissimilar to Wisdom, and yet she becomes the creator of things very similar: they both bring increase and added honours to men, they lead them on to high repute, to power, to dominion. What need to be tedious by enumerating the many examples? Even Nature herself, who creates and <pb xml:id="v.4.p.325"/> produces all things for us, some think to be Fortune, others Wisdom. Wherefore our present discourse does, in a measure, bestow a fair and enviable dignity upon Rome, if we raise the question over her, even as we do over earth and sea, heaven and stars, whether she has come to her present state by Fortune or by Forethought.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, Wisdom.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">I believe myself to be right in suspecting that, even if Fortune and Virtue are engaged in a direct and continual strife and discord with each other, yet, at least for such a welding together of dominion and power, it is likely that they suspended hostilities and joined forces; and by joining forces they co-operated in completing this most beautiful of human works. Even as Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 28 b, 31 b-32 b.</note> asserts that the entire universe arose from fire and earth as the first and necessary elements, that it might become visible and tangible, earth contributing to it weight and stability, and fire contributing colour, form, and movement; but the medial elements, water and air, by softening and quenching the dissimilarity of both extremes, united them and brought about the composite nature of Matter through them; in this way, then, in my opinion, did Time lay the foundation for the Roman State and, With the help of God, so combine and join together Fortune and Virtue that, by taking the peculiar qualities of each, he might construct for all mankind a Hearth, in truth both holy and beneficent, a steadfast cable, a principle abiding for ever, <q>an anchorage from the swell and drift,</q> as Democritus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, ii. 88, Frag. b 148: <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 495 e.</note> says, amid the shifting conditions of human affairs. For even as <pb xml:id="v.4.p.327"/> the physicists<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 878 c-f; <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Anima</title>, i. 1 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 1).</note> assert that the world was in ancient days not a world nor were the atoms willing to coalesce and mix together and bestow a universal form upon Nature, but, since the atoms, which were yet small and were being borne hither and thither, kept eluding and escaping incorporation and entanglement, and the larger, close-compacted atoms were already engaging in terrific struggles and confusion among themselves, there was pitching and tossing, and all things were full of destruction and drift and wreckage until such time as the earth, by acquiring magnitude from the union of the wandering atoms, somehow came to be permanently abiding herself, and provided a permanent abode in herself and round about herself for the other elements; even so, while the mightiest powers and dominions among men were being driven about as Fortune willed, and were continuing to collide one with another because no one held the supreme power, but all wished to hold it, the continuous movement, drift, and change of all peoples remained without remedy, until such time as Rome acquired strength and growth, and had attached to herself not only the nations and peoples within her own borders, but also royal dominions of foreign peoples beyond the seas, and thus the affairs of this vast empire gained stability and security, since the supreme government, which never knew reverse, was brought within an orderly and single cycle of peace; for though Virtue in every form was inborn in those who contrived these things, yet great Good Fortune was also joined therewith, as it will be possible to demonstrate as the discourse proceeds. <pb xml:id="v.4.p.329"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">And now, methinks, from my lofty look-out, as it were, from whence I survey the matter in hand, I can descry Fortune and Virtue advancing to be judged and tried one against the other.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This scene is perhaps imitated from Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Memorabilia</title>, ii. 1. 21-34: Prodicus’s Heracles and the contest of the goddesses, Virtue and Vice.</note> The gait of Virtue is unhurried, her gaze unwavering; yet the flush of ambition lends to her countenance some intimation regarding the contest. She follows far behind Fortune, who makes great haste, and in a throng conducting her and guarding her person are <quote rend="blockquote">Heroes slain in the conflict, wearing their blood-stained armour,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title> xi. 41.</note> </quote> men befouled with wounds in front, dripping blood with sweat commingled, trampling upon battered spoils. Is it your desire that we inquire what men are these? They declare themselves to be the Fabricii, the Camilli, the Decii, the Cincinnati, the Fabii Maximi, the Claudii Marcelli, and the Scipios. I see also Gaius Marius showing anger at Fortune, and yonder Mucius Scaevola is exhibiting his burning hand and crying, <q>Do you graciously attribute this also to Fortune?</q> And Marcus Horatius, the hero of the battle by the Tiber, weighed down by Etruscan shafts and showing his limping limb, cries aloud from the deep whirl of the waters, <q>Then am I also maimed by Fortune’s will?</q> Of such character is Virtue’s choir that advances to the lists, <quote rend="blockquote">Sturdy contender in arms, baleful to all that oppose.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Poet.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">But swift is the pace of Fortune, bold is her spirit, and most vaunting her hopes; she outstrips Virtue and is close at hand. She does not raise herself in the air on light pinions, nor advance <q>poised on tip-toe above a globe,</q> in a precarious and hesitant posture, and then depart from sight. But even as the Spartans say that Aphroditê, as she crossed the Eurotas, put aside her mirrors and ornaments and her magic girdle, and took a spear and shield, adorning herself to please Lycurgus, even so Fortune, when she had deserted the Persians and Assyrians, had flitted lightly over Macedonia, and had quickly shaken off Alexander, made her way through Egypt and Syria, conveying kingships here and there; and turning about, she would often exalt the Carthaginians. But when she was approaching the Palatine and crossing the Tiber, it appears that she took off her wings, stepped out of her sandals, and abandoned her untrustworthy and unstable globe.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This is the Fortuna of Horace, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Carmina</title>, i. 35; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Dio Chrysostom, <title rend="italic">Oration</title>, lxiii.

And she holds that celebrated Horn of Plenty in her hand, filled not with fruits of everlasting bloom, but as many as are the products of the whole earth and of all the seas, rivers, mines, and harbours, these does she pour forth in unstinted abundance. Not a few splendid and distinguished men are seen in her company: Numa Pompilius from the Sabine country and Priscus from Tarquinii, whom as adventitious and foreign kings she set upon the throne of Romulus; and Aemilius Paulus, leading back his army without a wound<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">An exaggeration; 100 were killed: <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Aemilius Paulus</title>, chap. xxi.

For at this time rhetoric, sophistry, and argumentation had already found their way into the City; and people were beginning to <pb xml:id="v.4.p.337"/> magnify such pursuits.

But do you observe how far you fall behind me? For if, at the time of his birth, I had not accompanied him in a helpful and humane guise, but had deserted and abandoned the infants, how could you have come into being and whence had you derived such lustre? If on that occasion there had not come to them a female beast swollen with the abundance and the burden of her milk, and in need of some creature to be fed rather than of something to yield her sustenance, but if instead there had come some utterly savage and ravening creature, would not even now these fair palaces and temples, theatres, promenades, fora, and public buildings be herdsmen’s huts and folds of shepherds who paid homage to some man of Alba or Etruria or Latium as their lord?</q> The beginning, as every one knows, is of supreme importance in everything,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the Pythagorean <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴ μέν τοι ἥμισυ παντός</foreign> (Iamblichus, <title rend="italic">Life of Pythagoras</title>, 162).</note> and particularly in the founding and building of a city; and this Fortune provided, since she had preserved and protected the founder.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">And in truth, it is generally agreed that a <pb xml:id="v.4.p.351"/> marvellous good Fortune guided the reign of Numa which endured for so many years.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Numa</title>, chap. iv.

(62 a).</note> is perhaps somewhat fabulous. For other mortals who are said to have attained divine marriages and to have been beloved of goddesses, men like Peleus and Anchises, Orion and Emathion, by no means lived through their lives in a satisfactory, or even painless, manner. On the contrary, it appears likely that Numa had Good Fortune as his true wife, counsellor, and colleague; and she took the city in charge when it was being carried hither and yon amid the enmity and fierceness of bordering tribes and neighbours, as in the midst of turbulent billows of a troubled sea and was inflamed by countless struggles and dissensions; and she calmed those opposing passions and jealousies as though they had been but gusts of wind. Even as they relate that the sea, when it has received the brood of halcyons in the stormy season, keeps them safe and assists in their nurture, even such a calm in the affairs of Rome, free from war or pestilence or danger or terror, Fortune caused to overspread and surround the city, and thus afforded the opportunity to a newly settled and sorely shaken people to take root and to establish their city on a firm foundation where it might grow in quiet, securely and unhindered. It is as with a merchantman or a trireme, which is constructed by blows and with great violence, and is buffeted by hammers and nails, bolts and saws and axes, and, when it is completed, it must remain at rest and grow firm for <pb xml:id="v.4.p.353"/> a suitable period of time until its bonds hold tight and its fastenings have acquired affinity; but if it be launched while its joinings are still damp and slippery, these will all be loosened when they are racked by the waves, and will admit the sea. Even so the first ruler and artificer of Rome, in organizing the city from rustics and shepherds, as though building up from a stout keel,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Is this a reminiscence of Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 81 b; or of Polybius, i. 38. 5?</note> took upon himself no few labours, nor of slight moment were the wars and dangers that he withstood in warding off, of necessity, those who opposed the creation and foundation of Rome. </p><p rend="indent">But he who was the second to take over the State gained time by good fortune to consolidate and make assured the enlargement of Rome; for much peace did he secure for her and much quiet.

But as it is, it seems likely that the peace of Numa’s reign was a provision to equip <pb xml:id="v.4.p.355"/> them for their subsequent wars, and that the people, like an athlete, having, during a period of forty-three years following the contests of Romulus’s time, trained themselves in quiet and made their strength staunch enough to cope in battle with those who later arrayed themselves against them. For they relate that no famine nor pestilence nor failure of crops nor any unseasonable occurrence in either summer or winter vexed Rome during that time, as if it were not wise human counsel, but divine Fortune that was Rome’s guardian during those crucial days.

But after Numa died it was opened, since the war with the Albans had broken out.

(<foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>); Plutarch did not himself publish the essay, but after his death the first editor neglected to cancel the present passage (Bruhn and Stegmann.) A translation follows: <p/> <q>One may consider the matter thus: there is in Rome an honoured shrine of Virtue which they themselves call the shrine of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Virtus</foreign>; but it was built late and after a considerable lapse of time by Marcellus, who captured Syracuse. There is also a shrine of Reason, or verily of Good Counsel, which they call <foreign xml:lang="lat">Mens</foreign> (Mind); but this also was dedicated by Aemilius Scaurus, who lived in the era of the Cimbrian Wars, at which time rhetoric and sophistry and Greek argumentation had already found their way into the City. But even now they have no temple of Wisdom or Prudence or Constancy or Magnanimity. But of Fortune there are very many ancient and splendid temples built with every honour, one might say, and interspersed throughout the most conspicuous districts and localities of the City. The shrine of the Men’s Fortune was built by Ancus Marcius, the fourth king, and so named because Fortune has the largest share with Manly Fortitude for winning the victory. And again, that the shrine of the Women’s Fortune was dedicated by the women who turned back Marcius Coriolanus when he was leading enemies against Rome, there is no one who does not know.</q> </note> And Servius Tullius, the man who of all the kings most increased the power of his people, and introduced a well-regulated government and imposed order upon both the holding of elections and military procedure, and became the first censor and overseer of the lives and decorum of the citizens, and held the highest repute for courage and wisdom, of his own initiative attached himself to Fortune and bound his sovereignty fast to her, with the result that it was even thought that Fortune consorted with him, descending into his chamber through a certain <pb xml:id="v.4.p.359"/> window which they now call the Porta Fenestella.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 273 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> He, accordingly, built on the Capitoline a temple of Fortune which is now called the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 281 e and 289 b-c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>; Cicero, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Legibus</title>, ii. 11. 28; Livy, xxix. 36. 8, xxxiv. 53. 5.</note> (which one might translate as <q>First-Born</q>) and the Temple of Fortuna Obsequens,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">With this and the following passage 281 d-f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, should be carefully compared.</note> which some think means <q>obedient</q> and others <q>gracious.</q> However, I prefer to abandon the Latin nomenclature, and shall endeavour to enumerate in Greek the different functions of the shrines of Fortune. There is, in fact, a shrine of Private Fortune on the Palatine, and the shrine of the Fowler’s Fortune which, even though it be a ridiculous name, yet gives reason for reflexion on metaphorical grounds, as if she attracted far-away objects and held them fast when they come into contact with her. Beside the Mossy Spring, as it is called, there is even yet a temple of Virgin Fortune; and on the Esquiline a shrine of Regardful<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Is this meant to be a translation of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Redux</foreign>?</note> Fortune. In the Angiportus Longus there is an altar of Fortune of Good Hope; and there is also beside the altar of Venus of the Basket a shrine of the Men’s Fortune. And there are countless other honours and appellations of Fortune, the greater part of which Servius instituted; for he knew that <q>Fortune is of great moment, or rather, she is everything in human affairs,</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A literal quotation from Demosthenes, <title rend="italic">Olynthiac</title> ii. 22.</note> and particularly since he himself, through good fortune, had been promoted from the family of a captive enemy to the kingship. For, when the town of Corniculum <pb xml:id="v.4.p.361"/> was taken by the Romans, a captive maiden Ocrisia,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <title rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</title>, iv. 1; Ovid, <title rend="italic">Fasti</title>, vi. 627 ff.; Livy, i. 39; Pliny, <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>, xxxvi. 27. 204.</note> whose fortune could not obscure either her beauty or her character, was given to be a slave to Tanaquil, the wife of king Tarquin; and a certain dependent, one of those whom the Romans call <foreign xml:lang="lat">clientes</foreign>, had her to wife; from these parents Servius was born. Others deny this, but assert that Ocrisia was a maiden who took the first-fruits and the libations on all occasions from the royal table and brought them to the hearth; and once on a time when she chanced, as usual, to be casting the offerings upon the fire, suddenly, as the flames died down, the member of a man rose up out of the hearth; and this the girl, greatly frightened, told to Tanaquil only. Now Tanaquil was an intelligent and understanding woman, and she decked the maiden in garments such as become a bride, and shut her up in the room with the apparition, for she judged it to be of a divine nature. Some declare that this love was manifested by the Lar of the house, others that it was by Vulcan. At any rate, it resulted in the birth of Servius, and, while he was still a child, his head shone with a radiance very like the gleam of lightning. But Antias<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Peter, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Frag. Hist. Rom.</title> p. 154, Valerius Antias, Frag. 12.</note> and his school say not so, but relate that when Servius’s wife Gegania lay dying, in the presence of his mother he fell into a sleep from dejection and grief; and as he slept, his face was seen by the women to be surrounded by the gleam of fire. This was a token of his birth from fire and an excellent sign pointing to his unexpected accession to the kingship, which he gained after the death of Tarquin, by <pb xml:id="v.4.p.363"/> the zealous assistance of Tanaquil.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 273 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> Inasmuch as he of all kings is thought to have been naturally the least suited to monarchy and the least desirous of it, he who was minded to resign the kingship,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Livy, i. 48. 9; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <title rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</title>, iv. 40. 3.</note> but was prevented from doing so; for it appears that Tanaquil on her death-bed made him swear that he would remain in power and would ever set before him the ancestral Roman form of government. Thus to Fortune wholly belongs the kingship of Servius, which he received contrary to his expectations and retained against his will. </p> </div>

After the great defeat of the Romans at the river Allia,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Camillus</title>, chap. xviii. (137 e); Livy, v. 35-38.</note> some in their flight found a haven in Rome and filled the people with consternation and terror, and caused them to scatter far and wide, although a few went to the Capitol and prepared to stand a siege.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. ibid.</foreign> chap. xx. (138 f); Livy, v. 39-40.</note> Others, immediately after their defeat, gathered together at Veii and appointed as dictator Furius Camillus, whom the people in their prosperity and lofty pride had rejected and deposed because he had become involved in a suit concerning the appropriation of public property.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Camillus</title>, chap. xii. (134 f).</note> But now, cowed and humbled after their defeat, they were for recalling him, and offered to hand over to him the supreme command, accountable to no one. Accordingly, that he might not be thought to be obtaining office because of the crisis, but in accordance with the law, and that he should not, as if he had given up all hope for the city, be elected by soldiery in a canvass of the remnants of the army, now scattered and wandering, it was necessary that the senators on the Capitolino should vote upon the matter after they had been informed of the decision of the soldiers. Now there was a certain Gaius Pontius,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ibid.</foreign> chaps. xxv.-xxvii. (141 d-143 a); Livy v. 46. 47; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <title rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</title>, xiii. 7.</note> a brave man, who, by volunteering personally to report these resolutions to the Senate on the Capitol, took upon himself great danger. For the way led through the midst of the enemy, who encompassed the citadel with sentries and <pb xml:id="v.4.p.371"/> palisades. When, accordingly, he had come by night to the river, he bound broad strips of cork beneath his breast and, entrusting his body to the buoyancy of this support, committed himself to the stream. Encountering a gentle current which bore him slowly down stream, he reached the opposite bank in safety, and, climbing out of the river, advanced toward the section void of lights, inferring from the darkness and quiet that no one was there. Clinging to the precipitous cliff and entrusting himself to the support of sloping and circuitous ways and jagged surfaces of the rock which would allow a foothold or afford a clutch for his hand, he reached the top of the rock; he was received by the sentries, and made known to those within the decision of the army, and having obtained the decree of the Senate, he returned again to Camillus. </p><p rend="indent">The next day one of the barbarians was wandering idly about this place, when he saw in one spot prints of feet and marks of slipping, and in another the bruising and tearing off of the grass, which grew on the earth of the cliff, and marks of the zigzag dragging and pulling up of a body; and this he told to the others. They, thinking that the way was pointed out to them by their enemies, attempted to rival them; and waiting till the very dead of night, they made the ascent, unnoticed not only by the sentinels, but also by the dogs which shared guard duty and formed the outpost, but then were overcome by sleep. </p><p rend="indent">Rome’s Fortune, however, did not lack a voice capable of revealing and declaring such a great mischance. Sacred geese<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 287 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> were kept near the temple of Juno for <pb xml:id="v.4.p.373"/> the service of the goddess. Now by nature this bird is easily disturbed and frightened by noise; and at this time, since they were neglected, because dire want oppressed the garrison, their sleep was light, and was made uncomfortable by hunger, with the result that they were at once aware of the enemy as they showed themselves above the edge of the cliif. The geese hissed at them and rushed at them impetuously, and, at the sight of arms, became even more excited, and filled the place with piercing and discordant clamour. By this the Romans were aroused, and, when they comprehended what had happened, they forced back their enemies and hurled them over the precipice. And even to this day, in memory of these events, there are borne in solemn procession a dog impaled on a stake,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Pliny, <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>, xxix. 4 (57); Aelian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Natura Animalium</title>, xii. 33; Lydus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Mensibus</title>, iv. 114; Bücheler, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Umbrica</title>, p. 128.</note> but a goose perched in state upon a costly coverlet in a litter. </p><p rend="indent">This spectacle exhibits the might of Fortune and the ease with which, whenever she busies herself and takes command, she provides from unexpected sources against all emergencies by implanting intelligence in the unreasoning and senseless, and prowess and daring in the craven. For who would not, truly, be struck with astonishment and amazement when he has come to learn and has embraced in his consideration the former dejection of the city and her present prosperity, and has looked upon the splendour of her temples, the richness of her votive offerings, the rivalry of her arts and crafts, the ambitious efforts of subject cities, the crowns of dependent kings, and all things which the earth contributes and the sea and islands, continents, <pb xml:id="v.4.p.375"/> rivers, trees, living creatures, plains, mountains, mines, the first-fruits of everything, vying for beauty in the aspect and grace that adorns this place? And then comes the thought: how near did all this come to not being created and to not existing at all! When all things else were overcome by fire and frightful darkness and gloom, by foreign swords and murderous rage, it was poor, irrational, and timorous creatures that contributed the beginning of deliverance; and those great heroes and commanders, the Manlii, the Servilii, the Postumii, the Papirii, the founders of future illustrious houses, whom naught separated from death, geese aroused to make defence for the god of their fathers and for their fatherland. But if it be true, as Polybius<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">ii. 18. 3.</note> has recorded in his second book, concerning the Gauls who had at this time seized Rome, that, when news suddenly came to them that their domains at home were in danger of being lost to them at the hands of neighbouring barbarians who had invaded their land and were masters of it, they concluded a treaty of peace with Camillus and withdrew - if this be true, then there can be no contention with Fortune that she was not the cause of Rome’s preservation, by distracting the enemy, or rather, by abstracting them from Rome quite unexpectedly. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">But what need is there to dwell on these matters, which offer nothing certain or definite because of the confusion of the events of Roman history and the destruction of contemporary chronicles, as Livy<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Livy, vi. 1. 2.</note> has recorded? Certainly the <pb xml:id="v.4.p.377"/> later events, plainer and clearer as they are, exhibit Fortune’s benignity; and to Fortune I ascribe also the death of Alexander, a man who by great good luck and brilliant successes, the result of his invincible daring and lofty aspirations, was sweeping swiftly through the world like a shooting star from East to West, and was already allowing the lustre of his arms to gleam upon Italy, since the destruction of Alexander the Molossian<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 330 b.c.; he was the uncle of Alexander the Great. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Livy, viii. 17. 24.</note> near Pandosia at the hands of the Bruttians and Lucanians served him as pretext for the campaign.
