					Many will find this little <foreign xml:lang="fre">jeu d'esprit</foreign> as pleasant
					reading as anything in Plutarch. In part, this may
					be due to its (perhaps accidental) brevity; but its
					originality and freshness are undeniable. These
					qualities have, to be sure, puzzled a number of
					scholars who are still disputing whether the sources
					are principally Epicurean or Peripatetic or Cynic.
					Nothing quite like it is known elsewhere,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">But talking animals were not new (Hirzel, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der Dialog</title>, i, p. 338 f.).</note> which sad
					lack baffles the <foreign xml:lang="deu">Quellenforscher</foreign>. So, rather than allow
					a touch of spontaneous imagination to Plutarch, it
					has been confidently asserted that the dialogue must
					come from the school of Menippus, or be an attempt
					to turn the tables on Polystratus, and so on.
				</p>
            <p rend="indent">
					Everything must have a source (if only the author's
					ingenuity) and the source here, so far as it can be
					predicated with any certainty, is the tenth book of
					the <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title> seen through the humorous eyes of a
					young Boeotian.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">So the sensible Hirzel (<foreign xml:lang="lat">op. cit.</foreign> ii, p. 131); see also Hartman, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarcho</title>, p. 576. Stylometry, however, does not encourage the view that this is an early work (Sandbach, <title rend="italic">Class. Quart.</title> xxxiii, p. 196).</note> We have here, then, a Boeotian

See the note on 995 f <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> It was once
					fashionable to assert, or imply, that since Plutarch
					was once a young Boeotian himself, matters could
					not be so simple, nor could he be the author. But
					the climate of scholarship is, perhaps, changing.
					There are few of Plutarch's admirers who will not
					claim this lively work for one of his more admirable
					achievements, written, perhaps, when he was quite
					young.

					Even if the authorship is accepted without hesitation, there is little else that is certain except that

					There are a number of troublesome lacunae; the
					work, as it stands, ends suddenly with a gay witticism instead of being continued to a more conventional termination.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the last note on 992 e <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> It is only too likely that the
					more mature Plutarch would have gone on and on;
					but what would the clever young man who concocted
					this conceit have done?<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Curiously enough, Xenophon is the most famous son of the historical Gryllus and he is said to have been once a prisoner in Boeotia (Philostratus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Vit. Soph.</title> 12).</note>

					For once, there is a good translation, or paraphrase,

Sisyphus was said by some to be his real father (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 301 d). <p/>Others, however, believe that some discussion of further virtues, such as natural piety, must have followed; and perhaps the account closed with a consideration of justice. But would Odysseus have been convinced (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 986 b)? Or is this as good a place as any to end? Plutarch used no stage directions, so that, as in the classical Platonic dialogues, when the characters stop speaking, the discussion is over and we are left to draw our own conclusions. The undoubted fact, however, that the work is mutilated in several other places allows us to leave the question open.</note>
