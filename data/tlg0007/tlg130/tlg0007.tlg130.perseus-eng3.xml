		<p>Many will find this little <foreign xml:lang="fre">jeu d’esprit</foreign> as pleasant reading as anything in Plutarch. In part, this may be due to its (perhaps accidental) brevity; but its originality and freshness are undeniable. These qualities have, to be sure, puzzled a number of scholars who are still disputing whether the sources are principally Epicurean or Peripatetic or Cynic. Nothing quite like it is known elsewhere,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">But talking animals were not new (Hirzel, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der Dialog</title>, i, p. 338 f.).</note> which sad lack baffles the <foreign xml:lang="deu">Quellenforscher</foreign>. So, rather than allow a touch of spontaneous imagination to Plutarch, it has been confidently asserted that the dialogue must come from the school of Menippus, or be an attempt to turn the tables on Polystratus, and so on. </p> 
		<p rend="indent">Everything must have a source (if only the author’s ingenuity) and the source here, so far as it can be predicated with any certainty, is the tenth book of the <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title> seen through the humorous eyes of a young Boeotian.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">So the sensible Hirzel (<foreign xml:lang="lat">op. cit.</foreign> ii, p. 131); see also Hartman, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarcho</title>, p. 576. Stylometry, however, does not encourage the view that this is an early work (Sandbach, <title rend="italic">Class. Quart.</title> xxxiii, p. 196).</note> We have here, then, a Boeotian <pb xml:id="v.12.p.490"/> pig instructing the favourite of Athena.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch actually quotes the proverb in his <title rend="italic">Life of Demosthenes</title>, xi. 5 (851 b) and <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 803 d, but does not seem to realize its possible application here. See the note on 995 f <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> It was once fashionable to assert, or imply, that since Plutarch was once a young Boeotian himself, matters could not be so simple, nor could he be the author. But the climate of scholarship is, perhaps, changing. There are few of Plutarch’s admirers who will not claim this lively work for one of his more admirable achievements, written, perhaps, when he was quite young. </p> <p rend="indent">Even if the authorship is accepted without hesitation, there is little else that is certain except that the Stoics are constantly under attack, though rather less directly than in the preceding dialogue. There is grave doubt about the title: is it no. 127 or no. 135 in the Lamprias Catalogue? Or, as it has become popular to call it, is it really the <title rend="italic">Gryllus</title>?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Ziegler (<title rend="italic">RE</title>, <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign> <q>Plutarchos,</q> 743) says that <title rend="italic">Gryllus</title> is impossible in spite of the Platonic examples, but appears to admit <title rend="italic">Ammonius</title> (no. 84 in the Lamprias Catalogue).</note> There are a number of troublesome lacunae; the work, as it stands, ends suddenly with a gay witticism instead of being continued to a more conventional termination.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the last note on 992 e <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> It is only too likely that the more mature Plutarch would have gone on and on; but what would the clever young man who concocted this conceit have done?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Curiously enough, Xenophon is the most famous son of the historical Gryllus and he is said to have been once a prisoner in Boeotia (Philostratus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Vit. Soph.</title> 12).</note> </p> <p rend="indent">For once, there is a good translation, or paraphrase, the German one of Bruno Snell in his <title rend="italic">Plutarch</title> <pb xml:id="v.12.p.491"/> (Zürich, 1948), though this version gives almost too exciting an impression of vivacity and wit by omitting the more tiresome sections. </p> <p rend="indent">Those interested in Gryllus’ remarks on the indecent ways in which men pervert animals to their taste will find a sympathetic exposition in E. G. Boulenger’s <title rend="italic">Animal Mysteries</title> (London, 1927). </p> </div>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> These facts,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the beginning <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Horace, <title rend="italic">Sat.</title> ii. 5. 1: <quote rend="blockquote" xml:lang="lat"><q>Haec quoque, Teresia, praeter narrata<gap reason="ellipsis" rend=". . .

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Circe"><label>CIRCE.</label> Quite a few, beloved Odysseus. But what is your reason for asking this question?</said> </p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> It is, I swear, because it would bring me noble glory among the Greeks if by your favour I should restore comrades of mine to their original humanity and not allow them to grow old in the unnatural guise of beasts, leading an existence that is so piteous and shameful.</said> </p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Circe"><label>CIRCE.</label> Here’s a lad who finds it appropriate that not only himself and his companions, but even total strangers should, through his stupidity, find his ambition their ruin.</said> </p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> This is a new potion<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">By which she transformed men into beasts: <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title>, x. 236.</note> of words that you are stirring and drugging for me, Circe. It will certainly <pb xml:id="v.12.p.495"/> transform me literally into a beast if I am to take your word for it that changing from beast to man spells ruin. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Circe"><label>CIRCE.</label> Haven’t you already worked a stranger magic than this on yourself? You who refused an ageless, immortal life at my side and would struggle through a thousand new dangers to a woman who is mortal and, I can assure you, no longer so very young - and this for no object other than to make yourself more gaped at and renowned than you already are, pursuing an empty phantom instead of what is truly good.</said> </p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> All right, let it be as you say, Circe. Why must we quarrel again and again about the same matters? Now please just grant me the favour of letting the men go free. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Circe"><label>CIRCE.</label> By the Black Goddess,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hecate, goddess of black magic, who was invoked for such functions at least from the time of Euripides’ <title rend="italic">Medea</title> (394 ff.).</note> it’s not so simple as that. These creatures are no run of the mill. You must ask them first if they are willing. If they say no, my hero, you’ll have to argue with them and convince them. And if you don’t, and they win the argument, then you must be content with having exercised poor judgement about yourself and your friends.</said> </p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> Dear lady, why are you making fun of me? How can they argue with me or I with them so long as they are asses and hogs and lions? </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Circe"><label>CIRCE.</label> Courage, courage, my ambitious friend. I’ll see to it that you shall find them both receptive and responsive. Or rather, one of the number will be enough to thrust and parry for them all. Presto! You may talk with this one.</said> <pb xml:id="v.12.p.497"/> </p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> And how am I to address him, Circe? Who in the world was he?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">After the Homeric formula, <foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign>, <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title>, x. 325.</note> </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Circe"><label>CIRCE.</label> What’s that to do with the issue? Call him Gryllus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <q>Grunter,</q> <q>swine.</q> </note> if you like. I’ll retire now to avoid any suggestion that he is arguing against his own convictions to curry favour with me. </said></p> </div>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> Hello, Odysseus. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> And you too, Gryllus, for heaven’s sake! </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> What do you want to ask? </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> Since I am aware that you have been men, I feel sorry for all of you in your present plight; yet it is only natural that I should be more concerned for those of you who were Greeks before you fell into this misfortune. So now I have asked Circe to remove the spell from any Greek who chooses and restore him to his original shape and let him go back home with us. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> Stop, Odysseus! Not a word more! You see, we don’t any of us think much of you either, for evidently it was a farce, that talk of your cleverness and your fame as one whose intelligence far surpassed the rest - a man who boggles at the simple matter of changing from worse to better because he hasn’t considered the matter. For just as children dread the doctor’s doses<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Lucretius, iv. 11 ff.; Plato, <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, 720 a. If one takes <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, 646 c literally, there was some reason for fear.</note> and run from lessons, the very things that, by changing them from invalids and fools, will make them healthier and wiser, just so you have shied away from the change from one shape to another. At this very moment you are not only living in fear and trembling as a companion of <pb xml:id="v.12.p.499"/> Circe, frightened that she may, before you know it, turn you into a pig or a wolf, but you are also trying to persuade us, who live in an abundance of good things, to abandon them, and with them the lady who provides them, and sail away with you, when we have again become men, the most unfortunate of all creatures! </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> To me, Gryllus, you seem to have lost not only your shape, but your intelligence also under the influence of that drug. You have become infected with strange and completely perverted notions. Or was it rather an inclination to swinishness that conjured you into this shape?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, you were always a swine. It is only your shape that is altered.</note> </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> Neither of these, king of the Cephallenians.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">After Homer, <title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, ii. 631; <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title>, xxiv. 378; or, taking the pun, <q>King of Brains,</q> <q>Mastermind.</q> </note> But if it is your pleasure to discuss the matter instead of hurling abuse, I shall quickly make you see that we are right to prefer our present life in place of the former one, now that we have tried both. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> Go on. I should like to hear you. </said></p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> And I, in that case, to instruct you. Let us begin with the virtues, which, we note, inspire you with pride; for you rate yourselves as far superior to animals<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 962 a <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>; on the virtues of animals see Aristotle, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Historia Animal.</title> i. 1 (488 f. 12 ff.); Plato, <title rend="italic">Laches</title>, 196 e; <foreign xml:lang="lat">al.</foreign></note> in justice and wisdom and courage and all the rest of them. But answer me this, wisest of men! Once I heard you telling Circe about the land of the Cyclopes,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title>, ix. 108 ff.</note> that though it is not ploughed at all nor does anyone sow there, yet it is naturally so fertile and fecund that it produces spontaneously <pb xml:id="v.12.p.501"/> every kind of crops. Do you, then, rate this land higher than rugged, goat-pasturing Ithaca,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title>, xiii. 242 ff.; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> iv. 606.</note> which barely yields the tiller a meagre, churlish, trifling crop after great efforts and much toil? And see that you don’t lose your temper and give me a patriotic answer that isn’t what you really believe. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> I have no need to lie; for though I love and cherish my native soil more, the other wins my approval and admiration. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> Then this, we shall say, is the situation: the wisest of men thinks fit to commend and approve one thing while he loves and prefers another. Now I assume that your answer applies to the spiritual field also, for the situation is the same as with the land<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The principle <foreign xml:lang="lat">ubi bene, ibi patria</foreign>: Pacuvius, frag. 380 (Warmington, <title rend="italic">Remains of Old Latin</title>, ii. p. 303); Aristophanes, <title rend="italic">Plutus</title>, 1151; Cicero, <title rend="italic">Tusc. Disp.</title> v. 37, 108; Appian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">B.C.</title> ii. 8. 50.</note>: that spiritual soil is better which produces a harvest of virtue as a spontaneous crop without toil. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> Yes, this too you may assume. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> At this moment, then, you are conceding the point that the soul of beasts has a greater natural capacity and perfection for the generation of virtue; for without command or instruction, <q>unsown and unploughed,</q> as it were, it naturally brings forth and develops such virtue as is proper in each case. </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> And what sort of virtue, Gryllus, is ever found in beasts? </said></p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> Ask rather what sort of virtue is not found in them more than in the wisest of men? Take first, if you please, courage, in which you take great pride, not even pretending to blush when you are called <q>valiant</q> and <q>sacker of cities.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, ii. 278.</note> Yet you, <pb xml:id="v.12.p.503"/> you villain, are the man who by tricks and frauds have led astray men who knew only a straightforward, noble style of war and were unversed in deceit and lies; while on your freedom from scruple you confer the name of the virtue that is least compatible with such nefariousness. Wild beasts, however, you will observe, are guileless and artless in their struggles, whether against one another or against you, and conduct their battles with unmistakably naked courage under the impulse of genuine valour. No edict summons them, nor do they fear a writ of desertion. No, it is their nature to flee subjection; with a stout heart they maintain an indomitable spirit to the very end. Nor are they conquered even when physically overpowered; they never give up in their hearts, even while perishing in the fray. In many cases, when beasts are dying, their valour withdraws together with the fighting spirit to some point where it is concentrated in one member and resists the slayer with convulsive movements and fierce anger<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Like eels or snakes whose tails continue to twitch long after they are dead.</note> until, like a fire, it is completely extinguished and departs. </said></p> 
         	<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus" rend="merge">Beasts never beg or sue for pity or acknowledge defeat: lion is never slave to lion, or horse to horse through cowardice, as man is to man when he unprotestingly accepts the name whose root is cowardice.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <q>Slavery</q> (<emph>douleia</emph>) as though derived from <q>cowardice</q> (<emph>deilia</emph>).</note> And when men have subdued beasts by snares and tricks, such of them as are full grown refuse food and endure the pangs of thirst until they <pb xml:id="v.12.p.505"/> induce and embrace death in place of slavery.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">They also refuse to breed in captivity: Pliny, <title rend="italic">Nat. Hist.</title> x. 182; <foreign xml:lang="lat">al.</foreign></note> But nestlings and cubs, which by reason of age are tender and docile, are offered many beguiling allurements and enticements that act as drugs. These give them a taste for unnatural pleasures and modes of life, and in time make them spiritless to the point where they accept and submit to their so-called <q>taming,</q> which is really an emasculation of their fighting spirit. </said></p> 
         	<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus" rend="merge">These facts make it perfectly obvious that bravery is an innate characteristic of beasts, while in human beings an independent spirit is actually contrary to nature. The point that best proves this, gentle Odysseus, is the fact that in beasts valour is naturally equal in both sexes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the Cynic doctrine in Diogenes Laertius, vi. 12: virtue is the same for women as for men.</note> and the female is in no way inferior to the male. She takes her part both in the struggle for existence and in the defence of her brood.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, 814 b.</note> You have heard, I suppose, of the sow of Crommyon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Theseus</title>, 9 (4 d-e), which gives a rationalizing version of the story and converts the sow Phaea into a female bandit of the same name.

Phicium, weaving her riddles and puzzles, if she had not continued to surpass the Thebans greatly in power and courage. Somewhere thereabouts lived also the Teumesian<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Frazer on Pausanias, ix. 19. 1.</note> vixen, a <q>thing atrocious</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Presumably a quotation which has not been identified.</note>; and not far away, they say, was the Pythoness who <pb xml:id="v.12.p.507"/> fought with Apollo for the oracle at Delphi.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 293 c, 421 c; Frazer on Apollodorus, i. 4. 1 (L.C.L., vol. i, p. 27).</note> Your king<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Agamemnon (<title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, xxiii. 295-299).</note> received Aethe<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A racing mare.</note> from the Sicyonian<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Echepolus.</note> as a recompense for excusing him from military service, making a very wise choice when he preferred a fine, spirited mare to a cowardly man.

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> From even these, dearest Odysseus, it is perfectly possible to gather that animals have a natural endowment of reason and intellect. For just as one tree is not more nor less inanimate than another, but they are all in the same state of insensibility, since none is endowed with soul, in the same way one animal would not be thought to be more sluggish or indocile mentally than another if they did not all possess reason and intellect to some degree - though some have a greater or less proportion than others. Please note that cases of dullness and stupidity in some animals are demonstrated by the cleverness and sharpness of others - as when you compare an ass and a sheep with a fox or a wolf or a bee. It is like comparing Polyphemus to you or that dunce Coroebus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For Haupt’s fine correction (<title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, vi, p. 4 = <title rend="italic">Opuscula</title>, iii, p. 552) <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Leutsch and Schneidewin, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Paroemiographi Graeci</title>, i. 101 (Zenobius, iv. 58); Lucian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Philopseudis</title>, 3.

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Odysseus"><label>ODYSSEUS.</label> But consider, Gryllus: is it not a fearful piece of violence to grant reason to creatures that have no inherent knowledge of God? <pb xml:id="v.12.p.533"/> </said></p> 
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Gryllus"><label>GRYLLUS.</label> Then shall we deny, Odysseus, that so wise and remarkable a man as you had Sisyphus for a father?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Most critics (and very emphatically Ziegler) believe that the end, perhaps quite a long continuation, is lost; but Reiske ingeniously supposes Gryllus’ final answer to mean: <q>If those who do not know God cannot possess reason, then you, wise Odysseus, can scarcely be descended from such a notorious atheist as Sisyphus.</q> (For Sisyphus’ famous assertion that <q>the gods are only a utilitarian invention</q> see Critias, <title rend="italic">Sisyphus</title>, frag. 1: Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> pp. 771 f.). <p/>There would, then, be no further point in prolonging the discussion; and no doubt by this time Odysseus has changed his mind about the desirability of any further metamorphosis of his interlocutor, since the last argument touches him nearly. Sisyphus was said by some to be his real father (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 301 d). <p/>Others, however, believe that some discussion of further virtues, such as natural piety, must have followed; and perhaps the account closed with a consideration of justice. But would Odysseus have been convinced (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 986 b)? Or is this as good a place as any to end? Plutarch used no stage directions, so that, as in the classical Platonic dialogues, when the characters stop speaking, the discussion is over and we are left to draw our own conclusions. The undoubted fact, however, that the work is mutilated in several other places allows us to leave the question open.</note> </said></p> </div>
