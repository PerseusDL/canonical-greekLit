                        <p>It is the life of Alexander the king, and of Caesar, who overthrew
                            Pompey, that I am writing in this book, and the multitude of the deeds
                            to be treated is so great that I shall make no other preface than to
                            entreat my readers, in case I do not tell of all the famous actions of
                            these men, nor even speak exhaustively at all in each particular case,

                            illustrious deeds there is not always a manifestation of virtue or vice,
                            nay, a slight thing like a phrase or a jest often makes a greater
                            revelation of character than battles where thousands fall, or the
                            greatest armaments, or sieges of cities. </p>

                        <p>Accordingly, just as painters get the likenesses in their portraits from
                            the face and the expression of the eyes, wherein the character shows
                            itself, but make very little account of the other parts of the body, so
                            I must be permitted to devote myself rather to the signs of the soul in
                            men, and by means of these to portray the life of each, leaving to
                            others the description of their great contests. </p>

                        <p>As for the lineage of Alexander, on his father’s side he was a descendant
                            of Heracles through Caranus, and on his mother’s side a descendant of
                            Aeacus through Neoptolemus; this is accepted without any question. And
                            we are told that Philip, after being initiated into the mysteries of
                            Samothrace at the same time with Olympias, he himself being still a
                            youth and she an orphan child, fell in love with her and betrothed
                            himself to her at once with the consent of her brother, Arymbas. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
                        <p>Well, then, the night before that on which the marriage was consummated,
                            the bride dreamed that there was a peal of thunder and that a
                            thunder-bolt fell upon her womb, and that thereby much fire was kindled,
                            which broke into flames that travelled all about, and then was
                            extinguished. At a later time, too, after the marriage, Philip dreamed
                            that he was putting a seal upon his wife’s womb; and the device of the
                            seal, as he thought, was the figure of a lion. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
                        <p>The other seers, now, were led by the vision to suspect that Philip
                            needed to put a closer watch upon his marriage relations; but Aristander
                            of Telmessus said that the woman was pregnant, since no seal was put
                            upon what was empty, and pregnant of a son whose nature would be bold
                            and lion-like. </p>

                    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
                        <p>Moreover, a serpent was once seen lying stretched out by the side of
                            Olympias as she slept, and we are told that this, more than anything
                            else, dulled the ardour of Philip’s attentions to his wife, so that he
                            no longer came often to sleep by her side, either because he feared that
                            some spells and enchantments might be practised upon him by her, or
                            because he shrank from her embraces in the conviction that she was the
                            partner of a superior being. </p>

                        <p>But concerning these matters there is another story to this effect: all
                            the women of these parts were addicted to the Orphic rites and the
                            orgies of Dionysus from very ancient times (being called Klodones and
                            Mimallones<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Macedonian names for Bacchantes.</note>), and imitated in many ways
                            the practices of the Edonian women and the Thracian women about Mount

                            fashion, used to provide the revelling companies with great tame
                            serpents, which would often lift their heads from out the ivy and the

                            who bade him sacrifice to Ammon and hold that god in greatest reverence,
                            but told him he was to lose that one of his eyes which he had applied to
                            the chink in the door when he espied the god, in the form of a serpent,

                            begetting, and bade him have purposes worthy of his birth. Others, on
                            the contrary, say that she repudiated the idea, and said: <q type="spoken">Alexander

                            this day the temple of Ephesian Artemis was burnt. It was apropos of
                            this that Hegesias the Magnesian made an utterance frigid enough to have
                            extinguished that great conflagration. He said, namely, it was no wonder
                            that the temple of Artemis was burned down, since the goddess was busy
                            bringing Alexander into the world. </p>

                            and crying aloud that woe and great calamity for Asia had that day been
                            born.</p>

                        <p>To Philip, however, who had just taken Potidaea, there came three
                            messages at the same time: the first that Parmenio had conquered the Illyrians in a great battle,
                            the second that his race-horse had won a victory at the Olympic games,
                            while a third announced the birth of Alexander. These things delighted
                            him, of course, and the seers raised his spirits still higher by
                            declaring that the son whose birth coincided with three victories would
                            be always victorious. </p>

                            him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander
                            himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. For those
                            peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried
                            to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to
                            the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately
                            observed. </p>

                            was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into
                            ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. Moreover, that a
                            very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance
                            about his mouth and all his flesh, so that his garments were filled with

                            Theophrastus thinks, where moist humours are acted upon by heat.
                            Wherefore the dry and parched regions of the world produce the most and
                            best spices; for the sun draws away the moisture which, like material of

                            boy his self-restraint showed itself in the fact that, although he was
                            impetuous and violent in other matters, the pleasures of the body had
                            little hold upon him, and he indulged in them with great moderation,

                            Olympia engraved upon his coins; nay, when those about him inquired

                            enquiring about the length of the roads and the character of the journey

                            horse, took hold of his bridle-rein, and turned him towards the sun; for
                            he had noticed, as it would seem, that the horse was greatly disturbed

                            Erigyius and Ptolemy, men whom Alexander afterwards recalled and had in

                            an enemy who was many times more numerous than they; but when the
                            Macedonian garrison also, leaving the citadel of the Cadmeia, fell upon
                            them in the rear, most of them were surrounded, and fell in the battle
                            itself and their city was taken, plundered, and razed to the ground.
                            This was done, in the main, because Alexander expected that the Greeks
                            would be terrified by so great a disaster and cower down in quiet, but
                            apart from this, he also plumed himself on gratifying the complaints of
                            his allies; for the Phocians and Plataeans had denounced the Thebans.

                            them call the month a second Artemisius; and when Parmenio, on the
                            ground that it was too late in the day, objected to their risking the
                            passage, he declared that the Hellespont would blush for shame, if,

                            like a frenzied and foolish commander rather than a wise one. However,
                            he persisted in his attempt to cross, gained the opposite banks with

                            shattered. Many rushed upon Alexander, for he was conspicuous by his
                            buckler and by his helmet’s crest, on either side of which was fixed a
                            plume of wonderful size and whiteness. But although a javelin pierced
                            the joint of his breastplate, he was not wounded; and when Rhoesaces and

                            been persuaded by Dareius with the promise of large gifts and a marriage

                        <p>Now, there was in the army of Dareius a certain Macedonian who had fled
                            from his country, Amyntas by name, and he was well acquainted with the
                            nature of Alexander. This man, when he saw that Dareius was eager to
                            attack Alexander within the narrow passes of the mountains, begged him
                            to remain where he was, that he might fight a decisive battle with his
                            vast forces against inferior numbers in plains that were broad and
                            spacious. </p>

                                <q type="spoken">Indeed,</q> said Amyntas, <q type="spoken">on this point, O king, thou mayest

                            to these words of Amyntas, but broke camp and marched into Cilicia, and
                            at the same time Alexander marched into Syria against him. </p>

                            the passes, while Dareius was as eager to extricate his forces from the
                            passes and regain his former camping-ground. For he already saw that he
                            had done wrong to throw himself into places which were rendered unfit
                            for cavalry by sea and mountains and a river running through the middle
                            (the Pinarus), which were broken up in many parts, and favoured the

                            victory. For since he was so vastly inferior in numbers to the
                            Barbarians, he gave them no opportunity to encircle him, but, leading
                            his right wing in person, extended it past the enemy’s left, got on
                            their flank, and routed the Barbarians who were opposed to him, fighting
                            among the foremost, so that he got a sword-wound in the thigh. Chares
                            says this wound was given him by Dareius, with whom he had a

                            thigh with a dagger, but that no serious harm resulted from the wound.
                            Although he won a brilliant victory and destroyed more than a hundred

                            chariot, and his bow, before he came back from the pursuit. </p>

                            lamented, believing that he was dead. Accordingly, after a considerable

                            he abated not one jot of their honourable maintenance, nay, they enjoyed

                            in talking than in drinking, always holding some long discourse, and
                            this too when he had abundant leisure. For in the stress of affairs he
                            was not to be detained, as other commanders were, either by wine, or

                            breakfast sitting; then, he would spend the day in hunting, or
                            administering justice, or arranging his military affairs, or reading. If
                            he were making a march which was not very urgent, he would practise, as

                            fire-brand, brought it to his own party. These kindled a great fire and

                            after the trumpet had sounded the signal, he attacked the walls with
                            greater vigour than he had at first intended. The assault became fierce,

                            punished; and then, regarding his own empire, he asked whether it was
                            given to him to become lord and master of all mankind. The god gave
                            answer that this was given to him, and that Philip was fully avenged.
                            Then Alexander made splendid offerings to the god and gave his priests

                            on his return. And some say that the prophet, wishing to show his

                            brilliant, not only by their furnishings, but also by the competitors
                            who exhibited them. For the kings of Cyprus were the choregi, or
                            exhibitors, just like, at Athens, those chosen by lot from the tribes,
                            and they competed against each other with amazing ambition. Most eager
                            of all was the contention between Nicocreon of Salamis and Pasicrates of
                            Soli. </p>

                            proclaimed victor. But then, as it would appear, on leaving the theatre,
                            he said that he approved the decision of the judges, but would gladly

                            battle, had taken to stones and sticks, being now many and hard to
                            quell. When he heard this, Alexander ordered the leaders themselves to
                            fight in single combat; to the one called Alexander he himself gave
                            armour, and to the one called Dareius, Philotas. The army were

                            have passed the rest of the night in a deeper sleep than usual, so that
                            when his officers came to him in the early morning they were amazed, and
                            on their own authority issued orders that the soldiers should first take
                            breakfast. Then, since the occasion was urgent, Parmenio entered the
                            tent, and standing by his couch called Alexander twice or thrice by
                            name; and when he had thus roused him, he asked him how he could
                            possibly sleep as if he were victorious, instead of being about to fight

                            very thick of the struggle did he show himself great, and firm in his

                            distress, when the Bactrian cavalry fell upon the Macedonians with great
                            impetuosity and violence, and when Mazaeus sent horsemen round outside
                            the line of battle to attack those who were guarding the Macedonian
                            baggage. Therefore, too, Parmenio, much disturbed by both occurrences,
                            sent messengers to Alexander telling him that camp and baggage were
                            gone, unless he speedily sent strong reinforcements from front to rear.

                                first.</q> Accordingly, the king ordered that five talents should be
                            given him. What lofty airs his friends and bodyguards were wont to
                            display over the wealth bestowed by him, is plain from a letter which
                            Olympias wrote to him. </p>

                            opened; the king did not prevent him, but took the ring from his own

                            larger one. He, however, declined it saying: <q type="spoken">O King, formerly there

                            who was now king, the fourth book of his history, in which was the tale
                            of the Amazon, at which Lysimachus smiled gently and said: <q type="spoken">And where

                            harmonize well with the matters which he had in hand. For the Barbarians

                            were matters of great importance about which they must see him. But
                            Philotas, for whatever reason (and the reason is not known), would not
                            conduct them in, alleging that the king was engaged on other matters of

                            against Philotas, on the ground that he had neglected their petitions on
                            two occasions. This greatly incensed Alexander; and when he found that

                            things too easily when he supposed that Limnus, a man of Chalaestra, had
                            set his hand to a deed of so great daring on his own account; nay, they

                            higher power, and enquiry into the plot should be made in those quarters

                            to him and share it with him. It chanced that Cleitus was sacrificing,
                            but he gave up the sacrifice and came; and three of the sheep on which

                            telling him that the omen was bad, he ordered them to sacrifice in all

                            harsh temper and wilful, was more than ever vexed, and insisted that it
                            was not well done, when among Barbarians and enemies, to insult

                            tent along the river Oxus, uncovered a spring of liquid which was oily
                            and fatty; but when the top of it was drawn off, there flowed at once a
                            pure and clear oil, which appeared to differ from olive oil neither in
                            odour nor in flavour, and in smoothness and lustre was altogether the

                            toilsome; for oil, they said, was given to men by Heaven as an aid to

                            his army suffered were caused by lack of necessary provisions and
                            severity of weather. Still, he was eager to overcome fortune by boldness
                            and force by valour, and thought nothing invincible for the courageous,

                            asked Oxyartes what sort of a man Sisimithres himself was in point of
                            spirit. And when Oxyartes replied that he was most cowardly of men,

                            after attacking another citadel equally precipitous, he was urging on
                            the younger Macedonians, and addressing one who bore the name of
                            Alexander, said: <q type="spoken">It behooves thee, at least, to be a brave man, even

                            citadel called Nysa because there was a deep river in front of it,
                            Alexander, halting on the bank, cried: <q type="spoken">Most miserable man that I am,

                            setting in that direction; and the shore between the two currents gave
                            his men no sure footing, since it was broken and slippery. And here it

                            wading breast-high in water, and that after he had crossed he led his
                            horsemen twenty furlongs in advance of his infantry, calculating that,
                            in case the enemy attacked with their cavalry, he would be far superior

                            join him in good season. And one of these suppositions came to pass.

                                Alexander in person to suspend his march to Babylon. It was in the

                            sacrificed to learn Alexander’s fate, Alexander called Pythagoras the
                            seer. Pythagoras did not deny the fact, whereupon Alexander asked him
                            what was the character of the sacrifice. And when the seer told that the

                            to death. Again, he once took off his clothes for exercise and was
                            playing at ball, and when it was time to dress again, the young men who
                            were playing with him beheld a man seated on the king’s throne, in

                            that he was a native of Messenia; in consequence of some charge brought
                            against him, he said, he had been brought thither from the sea-board,

                            come to him and loosed his chains and brought him to this spot, bidding

                            the favour of Heaven and suspicious of his friends. He was particularly
                            afraid of Antipater and of his sons, one of whom, Iolas, was his chief
                            cupbearer; the other, Cassander, had only recently come to Babylon, and
                            when he saw some Barbarians doing obeisance to Alexander, since he had
                            been reared as a Greek and had never seen such a sight as this before,

                            bringing charges against Antipater, Alexander interrupted him, saying:

                            charges, Alexander burst out laughing and said: <q type="spoken">These are the famous
