<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Such was Solon, and with him we compare Publicola, to whom the Roman people gave this surname later as a mark of honour. Before that he was called Publius Valerius, and was reputed to be a descendant of that ancient Valerius who was most instrumental in making the Romans and the Sabines one people instead of enemies; for it was he more than anyone else that persuaded their kings to come together, and settled their differences. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Such being his lineage, Valerius, as we are told, while Rome was still a kingdom, was conspicuous for his eloquence and wealth, always employing the one with integrity and boldness in the service of justice, while with the other he gave liberal and kindly aid to the poor and needy. It was therefore clear that, should Rome become a democracy, he would at once be one of its foremost men.
			
         
				        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now Tarquinius Superbus had not acquired his power honourably, but by the violation of divine and human laws; nor did he exercise it in kingly fashion, but after the manner of an insolent and haughty tyrant. The people therefore hated him, resented his oppressions, and found occasion for revolt in the fate of Lucretia, who made away with herself after violence had been done to her. Lucius Brutus, engaging in the revolution, came to Valerius first of all, and with his most zealous assistance drove out the kings.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 1.58">Livy, i. 58 f.</bibl>; <bibl n="Liv. 2.2.11">ii. 2, 11.</bibl>
            </note> 
				        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Then, as long as the people was likely to elect one man as their commander in place of the king, Valerius acquiesced, thinking it more fitting that Brutus should have the office, because he had led the way to freedom. But the very name of monarchy was odious to the people, who thought that it would be less vexatious to submit to an authority which was divided, and therefore proposed and demanded that two men should be elected to the highest office. Then Valerius, who hoped that he would be chosen next to Brutus, and would be consul with him, was disappointed. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For against the wishes of Brutus, Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, was elected as his colleague,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 1.60.4">Livy, i. 60, 4.</bibl>
            </note> instead of Valerius. He was a man of no greater excellence than Valerius, but the influential citizens were afraid of the kings, who were still putting forth many efforts outside, and trying to appease resentment inside the city, and they therefore desired to have as their commander the most pronounced enemy of the royal family, believing that he would make no concessions to them.</p></div>
			
         
				        

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Valerius, accordingly, vexed that his desire to do his utmost for his country should be doubted, merely because he had received no private injury at the hands of the tyrants, withdrew from the senate, gave up his practice as an advocate, and abandoned entirely his public activities. This caused anxious remark among the multitude. They feared lest, in his wrath, he should attach himself to the royal exiles, and subvert the established order of the city, which was in a dangerous pass. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But when Brutus, who had his suspicions of certain others also, desired the senators to take a sacrificial oath, and set a day for the ceremony, Valerius went down with a glad countenance into the forum, and was the first to take oath that he would make no submission or concession to the Tarquins, but would fight with all his might in defence of freedom. This pleased the senate and inspired the consuls with courage. And his actions speedily confirmed his oath. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For envoys came from Tarquin bringing letters calculated to seduce the people, and specious words by which they thought the multitude were most likely to be corrupted, coming as they did from a king who seemed to have humbled himself, and to ask only moderate terms. These envoys the consuls thought should be brought before the assembled people, but Valerius would not suffer it. He was unalterably opposed to giving poor men, who considered war a greater burden than tyranny, occasions and excuses for revolution.</p></div>
			
         
				        

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After this, other envoys came announcing that Tarquin abdicated his throne and ceased to wage war upon the city, but demanded for himself, his friends, and his kinsmen, their moneys and effects,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 2.3.5">Livy, ii. 3, 5.</bibl>
            </note> wherewith to maintain themselves in exile. Many were inclined to grant this favour, and Collatinus in particular joined in advocating it, but Brutus, a man of harsh and unyielding temper ran forth into the forum and denounced his colleague as a traitor, because he would bestow the means for waging war and maintaining tyranny on men to whom it were a terrible mistake to vote even a bare subsistence in exile. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And when an assembly of the citizens was held, the first to speak among them was Caius Minucius, a private man, who exhorted Brutus and advised the Romans to see to it that the treasures fought with them against the tyrants, rather than with the tyrants against them. However, the Romans decided that, since they had the liberty for which they were at war, they would not sacrifice peace for the sake of wealth, but cast this also out along with the tyrants.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 2.4.3">Livy, ii. 4, 3.</bibl>
            </note>
			      
         Now the wealth, of course, was of very slight consequence to Tarquin, but the demand for
					it was at once a test of the peopleâ€™s disposition and a means of instigating
					treachery among them. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And it was with this that
					the envoys busied themselves, making the property merely a pretext for remaining
					in the city, and saying that they were selling part of it, and reserving part,
					and sending part of it away. At last they succeeded in corrupting two of the
					noble families of Rome, that of the Aquillii, which had three senators, and that
					of the Vitellii, which had two. All these, by the motherâ€™s side, were nephews of
					Collatinus the consul, and besides, the Vitellii were related in another manner
					to Brutus. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For Brutus had married a sister of
					theirs, and she had borne him several sons. Two of these, who had come to
					manhood, and were their near kindred and close companions, the Vitellii won over
					and persuaded to join the plot for betraying the city, to ally themselves with
					the great family and the royal expectations of the Tarquins, and rid themselves
					of the stupidity and cruelty of their father. For they gave the name of cruelty
					to that fatherâ€™s inexorable treatment of criminals, and as for his stupidity, he
					had for a long time, as it appears, feigned and assumed this, to insure his
					safety from the cruel designs of the tyrants, and afterwards the surname of
					Brutus, which had been given him for it, clung to him. </p></div>
         
				        

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>When, accordingly, the youths had been persuaded and held conference with the Aquillii, it was decided that all the conspirators should swear a great and dreadful oath, pouring in libation the blood of a slain man, and touching his entrails. For this purpose they met at the house of the Aquillii.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">At the house of the Vitellii, according to <bibl n="Liv. 2.4.5">Livy, ii. 4, 5.</bibl>
            </note> Now the room in which the ceremony was to be held was, as was natural, dark and somewhat desolate. Without their knowing it, therefore, a slave named Vindicius had concealed himself therein, not with design, or with any inkling of what was to happen there; 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>he merely chanced to be there, and when they came in with anxious haste, he was afraid to be seen by them, and hid himself behind a chest that lay there, so that he saw what they did, and heard what they resolved upon. Their decision was to kill the consuls, and when they had written letters to Tarquin to this effect, they gave them to his envoys, who were living there as guests of the Aquillii, and were then present at the conspiracy.
			
         
				        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Their business transacted, the conspirators departed, and then Vindicius stole secretly away from the house. He knew not what use to make of what had befallen him, but was at a loss, considering it a dreadful thing, as it really was, to arraign the sons of Brutus before their father, or the nephews of Collatinus before their uncle, on the most abominable charges, and yet believing that no Roman in a private station could be entrusted with such important secrets. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>The last thing that he could do, however, was to hold his peace, and driven on by his knowledge of the affair, he made his way somehow to Valerius, attracted especially by the affable and kindly ways of the man.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Vindicius laid the matter before the consuls, according to <bibl n="Liv. 2.4.6">Livy, ii. 4, 6.</bibl>
</note> For he was easily accessible to all the needy, always kept open house, and never refused to hear or help one of the lowly.</p></div>
			
         
				        

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Accordingly, when Vindicius came to him and told him the whole story, in the presence of his brother Marcus only, and of his wife, Valerius was struck with consternation and fear, and would not now let the man go, but shut him up in a room and set his own wife to guard the door. Then he ordered his brother to surround the royal residence, seize the letters, if possible, and take the servants into custody. He himself, with the numerous clients and friends who were always about him, and with a large company of retainers, went to the house of the Aquillii, who were not at home. 
				</p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Therefore, to the surprise of everybody, he forced the door, and came upon the letters lying in the quarters where the envoys were lodging. Meantime the Aquillii came up in hot haste, joined battle at the door, and sought to take away time letters. But Valerius and his party resisted the attack, threw their togas about their opponentsâ€™ necks, and after much struggling on both sides, at last succeeded in pushing them through the streets into the forum. The same success was had at time royal residence, where Marcus laid hands on other letters which were to be conveyed away in the baggage, seized as many of the kingâ€™s people as he could, and haled them to the forum.</p></div>
			
         
				        

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>When the consuls had quieted the tumult, Valerius ordered Vindicius to be brought from his house, the denunciation was made, the letters were read aloud, and the accused had no courage to reply. Most of the people held their peace for very sorrow, but a few spoke of exile as a penalty, wishing to do Brutus a kindness. They were also somewhat encouraged to hope by the tears of Collatinus and the silence of Valerius. But Brutus, calling each of his sons by name, said: 
				<q type="spoken">Come, Titus, come Tiberius, why do ye not defend yourselves against this denunciation?</q> 
				        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But when they made no answer, though he put his question to them thrice, he turned to the lictors and said: 
	<q type="spoken">It is yours now to do the rest.</q> These straightway seized the young men, tore off their togas, bound their hands behind their backs, and scourged their bodies with their rods. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>The rest could not endure to look upon the sight, but it is said that the father neither turned his gaze away, nor allowed any pity to soften the stern wrath that sat upon his countenance, but watched the dreadful punishment of his sons until the lictors threw them on the ground and cut off their heads with the axe. Then he rose and went away, after committing the other culprits to the judgement of his colleague.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">With this account, compare <bibl n="Liv. 2.5.5">Livy, ii. 5, 5-9.</bibl> Brutus looked on 
					<quote xml:lang="lat">eminente animo patrio inter publicae poenae ministerium.</quote>
            </note> He had done a deed which it is difficult for one either to praise or blame sufficiently. 
				</p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For either the loftiness of his virtue made his spirit incapable of suffering, or else the magnitude of his suffering made it insensible to pain. In neither case was his act a trivial one, or natural to a man, but either god-like or brutish. However, it is right that our verdict should accord with the reputation of the man, rather than that his virtue should be discredited through weakness in the judge. For the Romans think that the work of Romulus in building the city was not so great as that of Brutus in founding and establishing its form of government.</p></div>
			
         
				        

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After Brutus had left the forum at this time, for a long while consternation, horror, and silence prevailed among all who remained, as they thought of what had been done. But soon the weakness and hesitation of Collatinus gave the Aquillii fresh courage; they demanded time in which to make their defence, and the surrender of Vindicius to them, since he was their slave, and ought not to be in the hands of their accusers. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Collatinus was willing to grant this request, and was about to dissolve the assembly with this understanding; but Valerius was neither able to surrender the slave, who had mingled with the throng about him, nor would he suffer the people to release the traitors and withdraw. So at last he seized the persons of the Aquillii and summoned Brutus to the scene, crying aloud that Collatinus was acting shamefully in laying upon his colleague the necessity of killing his own sons, and then thinking it necessary for himself to bestow upon their wives the lives of his countryâ€™s betrayers and foes. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>The consul was indignant at this, and ordered that Vindicius should be taken away, whereupon the lictors pushed their way through the crowd, seized the man, and beat those who tried to rescue him. Then Valerius and his friends stood forth in the manâ€™s defence, while the people shouted for Brutus to come. He turned back, therefore, and came, and when silence had been made for him, said that for his sons, he himself sufficed as judge, but he would leave time fate of the other traitors to the votes of the citizens, who were free, and any one who wished might speak and try to persuade the people. However, by this time there was no need of oratory, but a vote was taken which unanimously condemned the men, and they were beheaded.
			
         
				        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Collatinus, as it would seem, was already under some suspicion on account of his relationship to the royal family, and the second of his names also was hateful to time people, who loathed the sound of Tarquin. But after these recent events, he saw that he was altogether obnoxious, and therefore resigned his office and withdrew secretly from the city.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 2.2.3">Livy, ii. 2, 3-10.</bibl>
            </note> A new election was consequently held, and Valerius was triumphantly declared consul, thus receiving a worthy reward for his zeal. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>In this reward he thought that Vindicius ought to share, and therefore had a decree passed which made him, first of all freedmen, a citizen of Rome, and entitled him to vote with any curia in which he chose to be enrolled. Other freedmen received the right of suffrage in much later times from Appius,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Appius Claudius Caecus, censor in 312 B.C.</note> who thus courted popularity. And from this Vindicius, as they say, a perfect manumission is to this day called

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After this, the property of the royal family was given to the Romans to plunder, and their house and palace were razed to the ground. But the pleasantest part of the field of Mars, which had belonged to Tarquin, was dedicated to that god. Now it chanced that it had just been reaped, and the grain still lay upon the ground; but since the field had been consecrated, they thought it not right to thresh it or use it in any way. They therefore with one accord carried the sheaves to the river and cast them in. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>In like manner also they cast in the trees which had been cut, and left the place wholly untilled and barren for the god of war. The quantities of stuff thus heaped together were not borne along by the current very far, but the advanced portions stopped and accumulated at the shallows which they encountered. The portions that followed these could not get through them, but impinged upon them and blended inextricably with them, and time aggregation was made increasingly firm and fast by the action of the stream. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For this brought along great quantities of mud, the addition of which increased the size and cohesion of the mass. And besides, the impacts of the current were not rude, but with a gentle pressure pushed and moulded everything together. Owing to its size and position the mass acquired fresh size, and an extent sufficient to receive most of what was brought down by the river. It is now a sacred island over against the city, containing temples of the gods and covered walks,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 2.5.1">Livy, ii. 5, 1-4.</bibl>

				        </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Some, however, say that this did not happen when the field of Tarquin was consecrated, but in later times, when Tarquinia devoted another field adjacent to this. Now Tarquinia was a holy virgin, one of the Vestals, and received great honours for this act, among which was this, that of all women her testimony alone should be received. The people also voted her permission to marry, but she did not avail herself of it. This is how the thing happened, as the tale runs.</p></div>
			
         
				        

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>But Tarquin, despairing of attempts to regain his throne by treachery, was eagerly welcomed by the Tuscans,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">By the people of Veii and Tarquinii, according to <bibl n="Liv. 2.6.4">Livy, ii. 6, 4 f.</bibl>
            </note> who set out to restore him with a great force. The consuls led the Romans out to meet them, and arrayed their forces in certain sacred precincts, one of which was called the Arsian grove, the other the Aesuvian meadow. When the engagement began, Aruns the son of Tarquin and Brutus the Roman consul encountered each other. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>It was not by chance, but both were driven on by hatred and wrath, the one to attack a tyrant and foe of his country, the other to avenge himself on the author of his exile. They urged their horses to the combat, but since they engaged with fury rather than calculation, they were reckless of themselves, and fell by one anotherâ€™s hands. The battle which had such a dreadful beginning ended no less disastrously; the armies, after inflicting and suffering equal losses, were separated by a tempest.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">According to <bibl n="Liv. 2.7.1">Livy (ii. 7, 1),</bibl> the Tuscans departed in terror after the battle.</note>
			      
         
				        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Valerius was therefore in perplexity, not knowing what the issue of the battle was, but seeing his soldiers as much disheartened by their own losses as they were encouraged by those of their enemies. So undistinguishable and equal was the slaughter on both sides. Each army, however was more convinced of defeat by the near sight of its own dead, than it could be of victory by conjecturing those of the enemy. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>But when such a night came on as must needs follow such a battle, and both camps were quiet, they say that the grove was shaken, and a loud voice issued from it declaring that the Tuscans had lost one man more in the battle than the Romans. The utterance was manifestly from some god,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Silvanus, as Livy tells the tale (<bibl n="Liv. 2.7.2">ii. 7, 2</bibl>).</note> for at once the Romans were inspired by it to loud shouts of courage, while the Tuscans were panic-stricken, abandoned their camp in confusion, and were for the most part dispersed. 
				</p></div>

They were also distressed for their ruler, who, like a homeless man, was now sharing the homes of others.

For although it is impossible for one who attempts so great a task to escape all notice, it is not impossible for him to do so long enough to make himself too powerful to be brought to trial, which trial his very crime precludes.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>While Tarquin was stirring up in Tuscany another war against the Romans, a thing of great portent is said to have happened. When Tarquin was still king, and had all but completed the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, either in consequence of an oracle, or else of his own good pleasure, he commissioned certain Tuscan craftsmen of Veii to place upon its roof a chariot of terra cotta. Soon after this he was driven from his throne.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>The Tuscans, however, modelled the chariot and put it in a furnace for firing, but the clay did not contract and shrink in the fire, as it usually does, when its moisture evaporates.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>To the seers, accordingly, this seemed a divine portent of prosperity and power for those who should possess the chariot, and the people of Veii determined not to give it up. When the Romans asked for it, they were told that it belonged to the Tarquins, not to those who had expelled the Tarquins. But a few days afterwards there were chariot races at Veii. Here the usual exciting spectacles were witnessed, but when the charioteer, with his garland on his head, was quietly driving his victorious chariot out of the race-course,

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>his horses took a sudden fright, upon no apparent occasion, but either by some divine ordering or by merest chance, and dashed off at the top of their speed towards Rome, charioteer and all.

The Veientines were amazed and terrified at this occurrence, and permitted the workmen to deliver their chariot.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus had been vowed by Tarquin, the son of Demaratus, when he was at war with the Sabines, but it was actually built by Tarquinius Superbus, the son, or grandson, of him who vowed it. He did not, however, get so far as to consecrate it, but was driven out before it was quite completed. Accordingly, now that it was completely finished and had received all time ornaments that belonged to it, Publicola was ambitious to consecrate it. 
				</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But this excited the jealousy of many of the nobility. They could better brook his other honours, to which, as legislator and military commander, he had a rightful claim. But this one they thought he ought not to have, since it was more appropriate for others, and therefore they encouraged and incited Horatius to claim the privilege to consecrating the temple. At a time, then, when Publicola was necessarily absent on military service, they got a vote passed that Horatius should perform the consecration, and conducted him up to the Capitol, feeling that they could not have gained their point had Publicola been in the city.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Some, however, say that Publicola was designated by lot, against his inclination, for the expedition, and Horatius for the consecration.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 2.8.6">Livy, ii. 8, 6-8.</bibl>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>This distressed all who heard it; But Horatius, not at all disturbed, merely said:

But Aruns, the son of Porsena, learning of the affair, came with all speed to their assistance, put their enemies to flight, and rescued the Romans.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>When Porsena saw the maidens thus brought back, he asked for the one who had begun the enterprise and encouraged the rest in it. And when he heard Cloelia named as the one, he looked upon her with a gracious and beaming countenance, and ordering one of the royal horses to be brought, all fittingly caparisoned, he made her a present of it. Those who say that Cloelia, and Cloelia alone, crossed the river on horseback, produce this fact in evidence.

Therefore it is that down to this very day, when there is a sale of public property, Porsenaâ€™s goods are cried first, and thus the manâ€™s kindness is honoured within perpetual remembrance.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>In the following year Publicola was consul again, for the fourth time, when there was expectation of a war within the Sabines and Latins combined.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Livy gives a very brief account of this war (<bibl n="Liv. 2.16.2">ii. 16, 2-6</bibl>).</note> At the same time also a sort of superstitious terror seized upon the city because all the women who were pregnant were delivered of imperfect offspring, and all births were premature. Wherefore by direction of the Sibylline books, Publicola made propitiatory sacrifices to Pluto, and renewed certain games that had been recommended by Apollo, and after he had thus made the city more cheerful in its mopes and expectations from the gods, he turned his attention to what it feared from men. For their enemies were plainly making great preparations and a powerful league against them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Now there was among the Sabines one Appius Clausus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Attius Clausus among the Sabines, Appius Claudius among the Romans, according to <bibl n="Liv. 2.16.4">Livy, ii. 16, 4.</bibl>

He could not, however, escape the fate of all great men, but was an object of jealous hate, and when he tried to stop the war, those who hated him charged him within trying to increase the power of Rome, with a view to making himself tyrant and master of his own country.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Perceiving that the multitude gave a ready ear to these stories, and that he himself was obnoxious to the war party and the military, he feared the issue, but with a large and powerful coterie of friends and kinsmen to defend him, continued his opposition. This made the Sabines put off and delay the war.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Publicola, accordingly, making it his business not only to know about these matters, but also to foment and promote the faction, kept some of his followers employed in bringing to Clausus from him such messages as this: 
				<q type="written">Publicola thinks thee too worthy and just a man to inflict any evil upon thy fellow citizens in self-defence, even though thou art wronged by them. But if thou wishest, for thine own safety, to change thine allegiance and flee from those who hate thee, he will receive thee with public and private honours which are worthy of thine own excellence and the splendour of Rome.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>On repeated consideration of the matter, this course seemed to Clausus the best that was open to him; he therefore summoned his friends, who in like manner persuaded many more, to join him, and taking five thousand families from their homes, wives and children included, the most peaceful folk among the Sabines, of gentle and sedate lives, he led them to Rome. Publicola knew beforehand of their coming, and gave them an eager and a kindly welcome, admitting them to all rights and privileges.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>For he at once incorporated the families in the Roman state, and gave each one two acres of land on the river Anio. To Clausus, however, he gave twenty-five acres of land, and enrolled him among the senators. This was the beginning of a political power which he used so wisely that he mounted to the highest dignity and acquired great influence. The Claudian family, which is descended from him, is no less illustrious than any in Rome.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Though the schism among the Sabines was thus removed by the emigration of these men, their popular leaders would not suffer them to settle down into quiet, but complained bitterly that Clausus, by becoming an exile and an enemy, should bring to pass what he could not effect by his persuasions at home namely, that Rome pay no penalty for her outrages. Setting out, therefore, within a large army, they encamped near Fidenae, and placed two thousand men-at-arms in ambush just outside of Rome in wooded hollows. Their intention was that a few of their horsemen, as soon as it was day, should boldly ravage the country.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But these had been ordered, whenever they approached the city and were attacked, to retire gradually until they had drawn the enemy into the ambuscade. That very day Publicola learned of this plan from deserters, and took measures accordingly, dividing up his forces.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Lucretius, his colleague, retaining in the city the lightest armed and most impetuous troops, was ordered to attack the enemyâ€™s horsemen as they ravaged the country; he himself took the rest of the army and encircled the enemy in their camp.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>At all points, then, the Sabines were worsted and undone. Whenever they were, they made no defence, but fled, and the Romans straightway slew them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>but those in the camp ran towards those in the ambuscade, while these, on their part, ran to those in the camp, so that fugitives encountered fugitives, and found those needing succour from whom they expected succour themselves. And all the Sabines would have perished, had not the neighboring city of Fidenae afforded a refuge to some, especially to those who fled from the camp when it was captured. All who did not gain this city were either slain or brought back to Rome as prisoners.</p></div>
