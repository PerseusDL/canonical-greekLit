<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent">Euphanes, to whom this essay is addressed, is known from no other source. That he and Plutarch were aged men when the essay was written appears from the opening sentences (see also Chapter 17, towards the end, 792 f). He was evidently a man of some distinction at Athens, where he held important offices (Chapter 20, 794 b). It is not unlikely that he may have asked Plutarch’s advice about retiring from public life and that this essay is in reply to his appeal, but there is no definite statement to that effect. Cicero’s <title rend="italic">Cato Maior</title> or <title rend="italic">De Senectute</title> differs from this in not being limited to the discussion of old age in its relation to public activities, but the two essays have much in common and may well be read in connexion with each other.</p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.10.p.77"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">We are well aware, Euphanes, that you, who are an outspoken admirer of Pindar, often repeat, as well and convincingly expressed, these lines of his, <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When contests are before us, an excuse </l> <l>Casts down our manhood into abysmal gloom.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pindar, ed. Bergk-Schroeder, p. 475, no. 228 (252).</note> </l> </quote> But inasmuch as our shrinking from the contests of political life and our various infirmities furnish innumerable excuses and offer us finally, like <q>the move from the sacred line</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In one form of the game of draughts the <q>pieces</q> or <q>men</q> stood on lines, of which there were five for each of the two players. One of these, perhaps the middle one, was called the <q>sacred line.</q> The expression as here used seems to be about equivalent to <q>playing the highest trump.</q> </note> in draughts, old age; and since it is more especially because of this last that these excuses seem to blunt and baffle our ambition and begin to convince us that there is a fitting limit of age, not only to the athlete’s career, but to the statesman’s as well, I therefore think it my duty to discuss with you the thoughts which I am continually going over in my own mind concerning the activity of old men in public affairs, that neither of us shall desert the long companionship in the journey which we have thus far made together, and neither shall renounce public life, which is, as it were, a familiar friend of our own <pb xml:id="v.10.p.79"/> years, only to change and adopt another which is unfamiliar and for becoming familiar with which and making it our own time does not suffice, but that we shall abide by the choice which we made in the beginning when we fixed the same end and aim for life as for honourable life - unless indeed we were in the short time remaining to us to prove that the long time we have lived was spent in vain and for no honourable purpose.</p>
<p rend="indent"> For the fact is that tyranny, as someone said to Dionysius, is not an honourable winding-sheet<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <emph rend="italic">Cf.</emph> Isocrates, vi. 125.</note>; no, and in his case its continuance made his unjust monarchy a more complete misfortune. And at a later time, at Corinth, when Diogenes saw the son of Dionysius no longer a tyrant but a private citizen, he very aptly said, <q>How little you deserve your present fate, Dionysius! For you ought not to be living here with us in freedom and without fear, but you should pass your life to old age over yonder walled up in the royal palace, as your father did,</q> But a democratic and legal government, by a man who has accustomed himself to be ruled for the public good no less than to rule, gives to his death the fair fame won in life as in very truth an honourable winding-sheet; for this, as Simonides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title rend="italic">Poet. Lyr. Graec.</title> iii. p. 417, no. 63 (104).</note> says, <quote rend="blockquote">last of all descends below the ground,</quote> except in the case of those whose love of mankind and of honour dies first, and whose zeal for what is noble fails before their desire for material necessities, as if the active and divine qualities of the soul were less enduring than the passive and physical. And <pb xml:id="v.10.p.81"/> it is not right to say, or to accept when said by others, that the only time when we do not grow weary is when we are making money. On the contrary, we ought even to emend the saying of Thucydides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Thucydides, ii. 44. 4. Pericles, in his great oration over the Athenians who fell in war, says <q>The love of honour alone never grows old, and in the useless time of old age the greatest pleasure is not, as some say, in gaining money, but in being honoured.</q> </note> and believe, not only that <q>the love of honour never grows old,</q> but that the same is even truer of the spirit of service to the community and the State, which persists to the end even in ants and bees. For no one ever saw a bee that had on account of age become a drone, as some people claim that public men, when they have passed their prime, should sit down in retirement at home and be fed, allowing their worth in action to be extinguished by idleness as iron is destroyed by rust. Cato,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See <title rend="italic">Life of Cato the Elder</title>, ix. 10.</note> for example, used to say that we ought not voluntarily to add to the many evils of its own which belong to old age the disgrace that comes from baseness. And of the many forms of baseness none disgraces an aged man more than idleness, cowardice, and slackness, when he retires from public offices to the domesticity befitting women or to the country where he oversees the harvesters and the women who work as gleaners. <quote rend="blockquote">But Oedipus, where is he and his riddles famed?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic">Phoen.</title> 1688. This line is spoken by Antigonê to her blind father Oedipus. Plutarch seems to imply that the old man who enters political life without experience is no better off than was Oedipus, in spite of his famous solution of the riddle of the sphinx, when exposed to the vicissitudes of exile.</note> </quote>  For as to beginning public life in old age and not before (as they say that Epimenides slept while a youth and awoke as an aged man after fifty years), <pb xml:id="v.10.p.83"/> and then, after casting off such a long-familiar state of repose, throwing oneself into strife and timeabsorbing affairs when one is unaccustomed to them and without practice and is conversant neither with public affairs nor with public men; that might give a fault-finder a chance to quote the Pythia and say, <q>Too late you have come</q> seeking for office and public leadership, and you are knocking unseasonably at the door of the praetorium, like some ignorant man who comes by night in festive condition or a stranger exchanging, not your place of residence or your country, but your mode of life for one in which you have had no experience. For the saying of Simonides, <q>the State teaches a man,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title rend="italic">Poet. Lyr. Graec.</title> iii. p. 418, no. 67 (109).</note> is true for those who still have time to unlearn what they have been taught and to learn a new subject which can hardly be acquired through many struggles and labours, even if it encounters at the proper time a nature capable of bearing toil and misery with ease. Such are the remarks which one may believe are fittingly addressed to a man who begins public life in his old age. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">And yet, on the other hand, we see that the mere lads and young men are turned away from public affairs by those who are wise; and the lawrs wrhich are proclaimed by the heralds in the assemblies bear witness to this, when they call up first to the platform, not the young men like Alcibiades and Pytheas, but men over fifty years of age, and invite them to speak and offer advice. For such men are not incited by lack of the habit of daring or by want of practice <pb xml:id="v.10.p.85"/> to try to score a victory over their political opponents. And Cato, when after eighty years he was defendant in a law-suit, said it was difficult when he had lived with one generation to defend himself before another. In the case of the Caesar<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">i.e.</foreign> Augustus.</note> who defeated Antony, all agree that his political acts towards the end of his life became much more kingly and more useful to the people. And he himself, when the young men made a disturbance as he was rebuking them severely for their manners and customs, said, <q>Listen, young men, to an old man to whom old men listened when he was young.</q> And the government of Pericles gained its greatest power in his old age, which was the time when he persuaded the Athenians to engage in the war; and when they were eager to fight at an unfavourable time against sixty thousand heavy-armed men, he interposed and prevented it; indeed he almost sealed up the arms of the people and the keys of the gates. But what Xenophon has written about Agesilaüs<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Agesilaüs</title>, 11. 15. </note> certainly deserves to be quoted word for word: <q>For what youth,</q> he says, <q>did not his old age manifestly surpass? For who in the prime of life was so terrible to his enemies as Agesilaüs at the extreme of old age? At whose removal were the enemy more pleased than at that of Agesilaüs, although his end came when he was aged? Who inspired more courage in his allies than Agesilaüs, although he was already near the limit of life? And what young man was more missed by his friends than Agesilaüs, who was aged when he died?</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Time, then, did not prevent those men from doing such great things; and shall we of the present <pb xml:id="v.10.p.87"/> day, who live in luxury in states that are free from tyranny or any war or siege, be such cowards as to shirk unwarlike contests and rivalries which are for the most part terminated justly by law and argument in accordance with justice, confessing that we are inferior, not only to the generals and public men of those days, but to the poets, teachers, and actors as well? Yes, if Simonides in his old age won prizes with his choruses, as the inscription in its last lines declares: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But for his skill with the chorus great glory Simonides followed, </l> <l>Octogenarian child sprung from Leoprepes’ seed.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title rend="italic">Poet. Lyr. Graec.</title> iii. p. 496, no. 147 (203).</note> </l> </quote> And it is said that Sophocles, when defending himself against the charge of dementia brought by his sons,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This story, though repeated by several ancient writers, deserves no credit.</note> read aloud the entrance song of the chorus in the <title rend="italic">Oedipus at Colonus</title>, which begins<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Sophocles, <title rend="italic">Oed. Col.</title> 668-673.</note>: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Of this region famed for horses </l> <l>Thou hast, stranger, reached the fairest </l> <l>Dwellings in the land, </l> <l>Bright Colonus, where the sweet-voiced </l> <l>Nightingale most loves to warble </l> <l>In the verdant groves;</l> </quote> and the song aroused such admiration that he was escorted from the court as if from the theatre, with the applause and shouts of those present. And here is a little epigram of Sophocles, as all agree: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Song for Herodotus Sophocles made when the years of his age were </l> <l>Five in addition to fifty.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title rend="italic">Poet.

And Polus the tragic actor, as Eratosthenes and Philochorus tell us, when he was seventy years old acted in eight tragedies in four days shortly before his death.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A long list of Greeks who lived to an advanced age is given by B. E. Richardson, <title rend="italic">Old Age among the Ancient Greeks</title>, pp. 215-222.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Is it, then, not disgraceful that the old men of the public platform are found to be less noble than those of the stage, and that they withdraw from the truly sacred contests, put off the political rôle, and assume I do not know what in its stead? For surely after the rôle of a king that of a farmer is a mean one. For when Demosthenes says<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Demosthenes, xxi. (<title rend="italic">Against Meidias</title>) 568.</note> that the Paralus, being the sacred galley, was unworthily treated when it was used to transport beams, stakes, and cattle for Meidias, will not a public man who gives up such offices as superintendent of public games, Boeotian magistrate, and president of the Amphictyonic council, and is thereafter seen busying himself with measuring flour and olive cakes and with tufts of sheep’s wool - will not he be thought to be bringing upon himself <q>the old age of a horse,</q> as the saying is, when nobody forces him to do so? Surely taking up menial work fit only for the market-place after holding public offices is like stripping a freeborn and modest woman of her gown, putting a cook’s apron on her, and keeping her in a tavern; for just so <pb xml:id="v.10.p.91"/> the dignity and greatness of high ability in public life is destroyed when it is turned to household affairs and money-making. But if - the only thing left - they give to self-indulgence and luxury the names of rest and recreation, and urge the statesman quietly to waste away and grow old in them, I do not know which of two disgraceful pictures his life will seem to resemble more closely, that of sailors who desert their ship, when they have not brought it into the harbour but it is still under sail, and devote themselves to sexual indulgence for all time to come, or that of Heracles, as some painters playfully, but with evil influence, represent him in Omphalê’s palace wearing a yellow gown and giving himself up to her Lydian maids to be fanned and have his hair curled. Shall we in like manner strip the statesman of his lion’s skin and make him constantly recline at banquets to the music of harps and flutes? And shall we not be deterred by the words addressed by Pompey the Great to Lucullus? For Lucullus gave himself up after his military activities to baths, banquets, sexual intercourse in the daytime, great listlessness, and the erection of new-fangled buildings; and he reproached Pompey for his love of office and of honour as unsuited to his age. Then Pompey said that it was more untimely for an old man to indulge in luxury than to hold office. And once when he wras ill and the physician prescribed a thrush (which was hard to get and out of season), and someone said that Lucullus had plenty of them in his breeding-place, Pompey refused to send and get one, saying, <q>Could Pompey, then, not live if Lucullus were not luxurious?</q> </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">For granted that nature seeks in every way <pb xml:id="v.10.p.93"/> pleasure and enjoyment, old men are physically incapacitated for all pleasures except a few necessary ones, and not only <quote rend="blockquote">Aphroditê with old men is wroth,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic">Aeolus</title>, Frag. 23, Nauck, <title rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 369. Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title> 285 b, gives two lines: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ’ ῆ τὸ γῆρας τὴν Κύ῀αν χαίρειν ἐᾷ</foreign> </l> <l> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἧ τ’ Ἀφροδίτη τοῖς γεροῦσαν ἅχθεται</foreign>, </l> <l> <quote>But either eld to Cypris bids farewell </quote> </l> <l> <quote>Or Aphroditê with old men is wroth.</quote> </l> </quote> </note> </quote> as Euripides says, but their appetites also for food and drink are for the most part blunted and toothless, so that they can, if I may say so, hardly whet and sharpen them. They ought to prepare for themselves pleasures in the mind, not ignoble and illiberal ones like that of Simonides, wrho said to those who reproached him for his avarice that, since old age had deprived him of all other pleasures, he was comforting his declining years with the only one left, the pleasure of gain. Public life, on the other hand, possesses pleasures most noble and great, those in fact from which the gods themselves, as we may reasonably suppose, derive their only or their chief enjoyment. These are the pleasures that spring from good deeds and noble actions. For if Nicias the painter took such delight in the labours of his art that he often had to ask his servants whether he had had his bath and his breakfast; and if Archimedes when intent upon his drawing-tablet had to be dragged away by force, stripped and anointed by his servants, and then drew diagrams upon his anointed body; and if Canus the flute-player, with whom you also are acquainted, used to say that people did not know how much greater pleasure he gave to himself than to others when he played, for <pb xml:id="v.10.p.95"/> if they did, those who wished to hear him would receive pay instead of giving it. In view of these examples, do we not perceive how great are the pleasures the virtues provide, for those who practise them, as the result of the noble deeds they do and their works for the good of the community and of mankind; and that too without tickling or enervating them as do the smooth and gentle motions made on the body? Those have a frantic, unsteady titillation mixed with convulsive throbbing, but the pleasures given by noble works, such as those of which the man who rightly serves the State is the author, not like the golden wings of Euripides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 655, no. 911.</note> but like those heavenly Platonic pinions,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title>, 246 b=248 e, where the soul is likened to a chariot and charioteer with winged steeds.</note> bear the soul on high as it acquires greatness and lofty spirit mingled with joy. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">And recall to your mind stories you have often heard. For Epameinondas, when asked what was the pleasantest thing that had happened to him, replied that it was winning the battle of Leuctra while his father and mother were still living. And Sulla, when he first entered Rome after freeing Italy of its civil wars, did not sleep at all that night, he was so borne aloft in spirit by great joy and gladness as by a blast of wind. This he has written about himself in his memoirs. For granted that, as Xenophon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Memorabilia</title>, ii. 1. 31.</note> says, there is no sound sweeter than praise, yet there is no sight, reminder, or perception in the world which brings such great pleasure as the contemplation of one’s own acts in offices and positions of State in which one may be said to be in places flooded with light and in view of all the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.97"/> people. Yes, and moreover kindly gratitude, bearing witness to the acts, and praise, competing with gratitude and ushering in deserved goodwill, add, as it were, a light and brilliance to the joy that comes from virtue. And it is a mans duty not to allow his reputation to become withered in his old age like an athlete’s garland, but by adding constantly something new and fresh to arouse the sense of gratitude for his previous actions and make it better and lasting; just as the artisans who were responsible for keeping the Delian ship<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">By <q>Delian ship</q> is meant the <title rend="italic">Paralus</title> which was sent annually from Athens with delegates to the festival at Delos. Annual repairs were so long continued that none of the original timbers remained and the question arose whether it was the same ship or not.</note> in good condition, by inserting and fastening in new timbers to take the place of those which were becoming weak, seemed to keep the vessel from those ancient times everlasting and indestructible. Now the preservation and maintenance of reputation, as of fire, is not difficult and demands little fuel, but no one can without trouble rekindle either of them when it has gone out and grown cold. And just as Lampis the sea captain, when asked how he acquired his wealth, said, <q>My great wealth easily, but the small beginnings of it slowly and with toil,</q> so political reputation and power are not easy to attain at first, but when once they have grown great it is easy to augment them and keep them great by taking advantage of casual opportunities. For when a man has once become a friend, he does not require many and great services that he may remain a friend, but constancy shown by small tokens always preserves his goodwill, and so likewise the friendship and confidence of the people do <pb xml:id="v.10.p.99"/> not constantly demand that a man pay for choruses, plead causes, or hold offices; no, they are maintained by his mere readiness to serve and by not failing or growing weary in care and concern for the people. For even wars do not consist entirely of pitched battles, fighting, and sieges, but they admit of occasional sacrifices, social gatherings in between, and abundant leisure for games and foolishness. Why, then, forsooth, is public life feared as inexorable, toilsome, and burdensome, when theatrical exhibitions, festive processions, distributions of food, <q>choruses and the Muse and Aglaï,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pindar, Bergk-Schroeder, p. 467, no. 199 (213). Aglaïa, one of the Graces, was especially, connected with festive merriment.</note> and constantly the worship of some god, smooth the brows of legislators in every senate and assembly and repay its troubles many times over with pleasure and enjoyment? </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">Now the greatest evil attendant upon public life, envy, is least likely to beset old age, <q>for dogs do indeed bark at whom they do not know,</q> according to Heracleitus, and envy fights against a man as he begins his public career, at the doorway, as it were, of the orator’s platform, and tries to refuse him access, but familiar and accustomed reputation it does not savagely and roughly resent, but puts up with mildly. For this reason envy is sometimes likened to smoke, for in the case of those who are beginning their public career it pours out before them in great volume because they are enkindled, but when they burst into full flame it disappears. And whereas men attack other kinds of eminence and themselves lay claim to good character, good birth, and honour, as though they were depriving <pb xml:id="v.10.p.101"/> themselves of so much of these as they grant to others; yet the primacy which comes from time, for which there is the special word <emph rend="italic">presbeion</emph> or <q>the prerogative due to seniority in age,</q> arouses no jealousy and is freely conceded; for of no honour is it so true that it adorns the giver more than the receiver as of that which is paid to old age. Moreover, not all men expect that the power derived from wealth, eloquence, or wisdom will accrue to them, but no one who takes part in public life is without hope of attaining the reverence and repute to which old age leads. So there is no difference between the pilot who has sailed in great danger against adverse winds and waves, and, after clear weather and fair winds have come, seeks his moorings, and the man who has struggled in the ship of State a long time against the billows of envy, and then, when they have ceased and become smooth, backs water and withdraws from public life, giving up his political affiliations and clubs along with his public activities. For the longer the time has been the greater the number of those whom he has made his friends and fellow-workers, and he cannot take them all out with him, as a trainer leads out his chorus, nor is it fair to leave them in the lurch. But a long public career is, like old trees, hard to pull up, for it has many roots and is interwoven with affairs which cause more troubles and torments to those who withdraw from them than to those who remain in them. And if any remnant of envy or jealousy does continue against old men from their political contests, they should rather extinguish this by power than turn their backs and go away naked and unarmed. For people <pb xml:id="v.10.p.103"/> do not attack them so much because of envy if they maintain the contest as because of contempt if they have given up. </p> </div>

And undoubtedly Homer also teaches this to those who hear aright; for Nestor, who went to the war at Troy, was revered and highly honoured, but Peleus and Laërtes, who stayed at home, were put aside and despised. For the habit of prudence does not last so well in those who let themselves become slack, but, being gradually lost and dissipated by inactivity, it always calls for what may be called exercise of the thought, since thought rouses and purifies the power of reason and action; <quote rend="blockquote">For when in use it gleams like beauteous bronze.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">From an unknown drama of Sophocles; Nauck, <title rend="italic">Trag.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">Certainly the office of king, the most perfect and the greatest of all political offices, has the most cares, labours, and occupations. At any rate Seleucus, they used to tell us, constantly repeated that if people in general knew what a task it was merely to read and write so many letters, they would not even pick up a crown that had been thrown away. And Philip, we are told, when he heard, as he was on the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.115"/> point of encamping in a suitable place, that there was no fodder for the beasts of draught, exclaimed: <q>O Heracles, what a life is mine, if I must needs live to suit the convenience even of my asses!</q> There is, then, a time to advise even a king when he has become an old man to lay aside the crown and the purple, to assume a cloak and a crook, and to live in the country, lest it be thought, if he continues to rule when his hair is grey, that he is busying himself with superfluous and unseasonable occupations. But if it is not fitting to say this about an Agesilaüs or a Numa or a Dareius, let us neither remove a Solon from the Council of the Areopagus nor a Cato from the Senate on account of old age, and let us not advise a Pericles to leave the democracy in the lurch. For anyhow it is absurd that a man when he is young should prance (about upon the platform and then, after having poured out upon the public all those insane ambitions and impulses, when the age arrives which brings wisdom through experience, should give up public life and desert it like a woman of whom he has had all the use. </p> </div>

No one can assert that. But if for no other reason, old men should engage in affairs of State for the education and instruction of the young. For just as the teachers of letters or of music themselves first play the notes or read to their pupils and thus show them the way, so the statesman, not only by speech or by making suggestions from outside, but by action in administering the affairs of the community, directs the young man, whose character is moulded and formed by the old man’s actions and words alike. For he who is trained in this way - not in the wrestling-schools or training-rings of masters of the arts of graceful speech where no danger is, but, we may say, in truly Olympic and Pythian games, - <quote rend="blockquote">Keeps pace as foal just weaned runs with the mare,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title rend="italic">Poet.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">Aeschines the Academic philosopher, when some sophists declared that he pretended to have been a pupil of Carneades although he had not been so, replied, <q>Oh, but I did listen to Carneades at the time when his speech had given up noisy declamation on account of his old age and had reduced itself to what is useful and of common interest.</q> But the public activity of old men is not only in speech but also in actions, free from ostentation and desire for popularity, and, therefore, just as they say that the iris, when it has grown old and has blown off its fetid and foul smell, acquires a more fragrant odour, so no opinion or counsel of old men is turbulent, but they are all weighty and composed. Therefore it is also for the sake of the young, as has been said above, that old men ought to engage in affairs of State, in order that, as Plato said<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, 773 d. He refers to Dionysus (wine) and Poseidon (water).</note> in reference to pure wine mixed with water, that an insane god was made reasonable when chastised by another who was sober, so the discretion of old age, when mixed in the people with boiling youth drunk with reputation and ambition, may remove that which is insane and too violent. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p rend="indent">But apart from all this, they are mistaken who <pb xml:id="v.10.p.121"/> think that engaging in public affairs is, like going to sea or to a war, something undertaken for an object distinct from itself and ceasing when that object is attained; for engaging in public affairs is not a special service which is ended when the need ends, but is a way of life of a tamed social animal<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <emph rend="italic">Cf.</emph> Aristotle, <title rend="italic">Politics</title>, i. 2, where man is called a social (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτικόν</foreign>) animal.</note> living in an organized society, intended by nature to live throughout its allotted time the life of a citizen and in a manner devoted to honour and the welfare of mankind. Therefore it is fitting that men should be engaged, not merely have ceased to be engaged, in affairs of State, just as it is fitting that they should be, not have ceased to be, truthful, that they should do, not have ceased to do, right, and that they should love, not have ceased to love, their native land and their fellow-citizens.

For there are many sickly young men and vigorous old men, so that the proper course is to dissuade, not the aged, but the disabled, and to summon into service, not the young, but those who are competent to serve. Aridaeus, for example, was young and Antigonus an old man, but the latter gained possession of almost all Asia, whereas the former, like a mute guardsman on the stage, was <pb xml:id="v.10.p.123"/> the mere name and figure of a king, exposed to the wanton insults of those who happened to have the real power. As, therefore, he is a fool who would demand that a person like Prodicus the sophist or a person like Philetas the poet should take part in the affairs of State, - they who were young, to be sure, but thin, sickly, and for the most part bedridden on account of sickness, - so he is foolish who would hinder from being rulers or generals such old men as were Phocion, the Libyan Masinissa, and the Roman Cato. For Phocion, when the Athenians were rushing into war at an unfavourable time, gave orders that all citizens up to sixty years of age should take their weapons and follow him; and when they were indignant he said: <q>There is nothing terrible about it, for I shall be with you as general, and I am eighty years old.</q> And Polybius tells us that Masinissa died at the age of ninety years, leaving a child of his own but four years old, and that a little before his end, on the day after defeating the Carthaginians in a great battle, he was seen in front of his tent eating a dirty piece of bread, and that when some expressed surprise at this he said that he did it [to keep in practice], <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>For when in use it gleams like beauteous bronze; </l> <l>An unused house through time in ruin falls,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic">Trag.

And it would be impossible to find many abler generals among the Romans than Lucullus, when he combined thought with action; but when he gave himself up to a life of inactivity and to a home-keeping and thought-free existence, he became a wasted skeleton, like sponges in calm seas, and then when he committed his old age to the care and nursing of one of his freedmen named Callisthenes, it seemed as if he were being drugged by him with potions and quackeries, until his brother Marcus drove the fellow away and himself managed and tended him like a child the rest of his life, which was not long. Dareius the father of Xerxes used to say that when dangers threatened he excelled himself in wisdom,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Cf.

In fact musicians, if they give up listening to music, and geometricians if they give up solving problems, and arithmeticians if they give up the practice of calculating, impair, as they advance in age, their habits of mind as well as their activities, although the studies which they pursue are not concerned with action but with contemplation; but the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.127"/> mental habit of public men - deliberation, wisdom, and justice, and, besides these, experience, which hits upon the proper moments and words and is the power that creates persuasion - is maintained by constantly speaking, acting, reasoning, and judging; and it would be a crime if, by deserting these activities, it should allow such great and so many virtues to leak out from the soul; for it is reasonable to suppose that love of humanity, public spirit, and graciousness would waste away, none of which ought to have any end or limit. </p> </div>

For just as, if it were fitting for us to continue singing to the end, we ought, since there are many underlying tones and modes of the voice, which musical people call harmonies, we ought, I say, when we have grown old, not to attempt that which is at once high pitched and intense, but that which is easy and also possesses the fitting ethical quality; just so, since it is more natural for human beings to act and speak to the end than for swans to sing, we must not give up activity as if it were a lyre too tightly strung, but we should relax the activity and adapt it to those public services which are light and moderate and attuned to old men. For we do not let our bodies be entirely without motion and exercise when we are unable to wield the mattock or use jumping-weights or throw the discus or fight in armour as we used to do, but by swinging and walking, and in some instances by light ball-playing and by conversation, old men accelerate their breathing and revive the body’s heat. Let us, then, neither allow ourselves to be entirely frozen and chilled by inaction nor, on the other hand, by again burdening ourselves with every office and engaging in every kind of public <pb xml:id="v.10.p.131"/> activity, force our old age, convicted of its weakness, to descend to words like these: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O my right hand, thou yearn’st to seize the spear, </l> <l>But weakness brings thy yearning all to naught.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic">Herc.

But for a very aged man that love of office which invariably offers itself as a candidate at every election, that busy restlessness which lies in wait for every opportunity offered by court of justice or council of State, and that ambition which snatches at every ambassadorship and at every precedence in legal matters, are, even if you eliminate the discredit attached to them, toilsome and miserable. For to do these things even with the goodwill of others is too burdensome for advanced age, but, in fact, the result is the very opposite; for such old men are hated by the young, who feel that they do not allow them opportunities for public activity and do not permit them to come before the public, and by people in general their love of precedence and of office is held in no less disrepute than is other old men’s love of wealth and pleasure. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p rend="indent">And just as Alexander, wishing not to work Bucephalus too hard when he was old, used to ride other horses before the battle in reviewing the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.133"/> phalanx and drawing it up in line, and then, after giving the watchword and mounting him, immediately charged the enemy, and fought the battle to its end; so the statesman, if he is sensible, will curb himself when he has grown old, will keep away from unnecessary activities and allow the State to employ men in their prime for lesser matters, but in important affairs will himself take part vigorously. For athletes keep their bodies untouched by necessary tasks and in full force for useless toils, but we, on the contrary, letting petty and worthless matters go, will save ourselves for things that are seriously worth while. For perhaps, as Homer says,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> xxii. 71.</note> <q>to a young man everything is becoming,</q> and people accept and love him, calling the one who does many little things a friend of the common folk and hardworking, and the one who does brilliant and splendid things noble and high-minded; and under some conditions even contentiousness and rashness have a certain timeliness and grace becoming to men of that age. But the old man in public life who undertakes subordinate services, such as the farming of taxes and the supervision of harbours and of the market-place, and who moreover works his way into diplomatic missions and trips abroad to visit commanders and potentates, in which there is nothing indispensable or dignified, but which are merely flattery to curry favour, seems to me, my friend, a pitiable and unenviable object, and to some people, perhaps, a burdensome and vulgar one. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p rend="indent">For it is not seasonable for an aged man even to be occupied in public offices, except in those which possess some grandeur and dignity, such as that <pb xml:id="v.10.p.135"/> which you are now administering at Athens, the presidency of the Senate of the Areopagus, and, by Zeus, the honour of membership in the Amphictyonic Council, which your native State bestowed upon you for life and which entails <q>a pleasant labour and untoilsome toil.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <emph rend="italic">Cf.</emph> Euripides, <title rend="italic">Bacch.</title> 66.</note> But even these offices aged men ought not to seek; they should exercise them though trying to avoid them, not asking for them but asking to be excused from them, as men who do not take office to themselves, but give themselves to office. For it is not, as the Emperor Tiberius said, a disgrace for a man over sixty years of age to hold out his hand to the physician<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> for medical assistance.</note>; but rather is it a disgrace to hold out the hand to the people asking for a ballot or a <foreign xml:lang="lat">viva voce</foreign> vote; for this is ignoble and mean, whereas the contrary possesses a certain dignity and honour, when an aged man’s country chooses him, calls him, and waits for him, and he comes down amid honour and friendly applause to welcome and accept a distinction which is truly revered and respected. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p rend="indent">And in somewhat the same way a man who has grown old ought to treat speech-making in the assembly; he should not be constantly jumping up on the platform, nor always, like a cock, crowing in opposition to what is said; nor should he, by getting involved in controversy, loose the curb of reverence for him in the young men’s minds and instil into them the practice and custom of disobedience and unwillingness to listen to him; but he should sometimes both slacken the reins and allow them to throw up their heads boldly to oppose his opinion and to show their spirit, without even being present or interfering except when the matter <pb xml:id="v.10.p.137"/> at stake is important for the common safety or for honour and decorum. But in such cases he ought, even when no one calls him, to run at a speed beyond his strength, letting himself be led by attendants who support him or having himself carried in a litter, as we are told that Appius Claudius did in Rome; for after the Romans had been defeated by Pyrrhus in a great battle, when he heard that the senate was admitting proposals for a truce and peace, he found that intolerable, and although he had lost the sight of both his eyes, had himself carried through the Forum to the Senate-house. He went in, took his stand in the midst of the senate, and said that hitherto he had been grieved by the loss of his eyes, but now he could pray not even to have ears to hear them discussing and doing things so disgraceful and ignoble. And thereupon, partly by rebuking them, partly by instructing and inciting them, he persuaded them to rush to arms forthwith and fight it out with Pyrrhus for the rule of Italy. And Solon, when it became clear that the popular leadership of Peisistratus was a contrivance to make him tyrant, since no one dared to oppose or prevent it, brought out his own arms, stacked them in front of his house, and called upon the citizens to come to the aid of their country; then, when Peisistratus sent and asked him what gave him confidence to do this, he replied, <q>My age.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <emph rend="italic">Cf.</emph> Aristotle, <title rend="italic">Constitution of Athens</title>, 14. 2, and Sandys’ note.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p rend="indent">However, matters of such urgent necessity do kindle and arouse aged men whose fire is quite extinct, provided they merely have breath; yet in other matters the aged man will sometimes, as has been said, act fittingly by declining mean and petty offices which bring more trouble to those who <pb xml:id="v.10.p.139"/> administer them than profit and advantage to those for whom they are administered; and sometimes by waiting for the citizens to call for him, long for him, and send for him at his house, he will, when he comes, be received with greater confidence by those who begged for his presence. And for the most part he will, even when present, be silent and let younger men speak, acting as a kind of umpire at the contest of political ambition; and if the contest passes the bounds of moderation, by administering a mild and kindly rebuke, he will endeavour to do away with contention, opprobrious language, and anger, will correct and instruct without fault-finding him who errs in his opinions, but will fearlessly praise him who is right; and he will voluntarily suffer defeat and will often give up success in persuading the people to his will in order that the young may grow in power and courage, and for some of them he will supply what is lacking with kindly words, as Nestor said, <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>No one of all the Achaeans will blame the words thou hast spoken, </l> <l>Nor will oppose them in speech; and yet thou hast reached no conclusion. </l> <l>Truly thou art a young man, and thou mightest e’en be my own offspring.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> ix. 55 ff.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p rend="indent">But more statesmanlike than this it is, not merely to avoid, when rebuking them openly and in public, any biting speech which violently represses and humiliates them, but rather in kindly spirit to suggest and inculcate in private to those who have natural ability for public affairs advantageous words and policies, urging them on towards that which is noble, adding brilliancy to their minds, and, after the manner of riding-teachers, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.141"/> enabling them at first to mount the populace when it is tractable and gentle; then, if the young man fails in any way, not letting him be discouraged, but setting him on his feet and encouraging him, as Aristeides raised up and encouraged Cimon and Mnesiphilus did the like for Themistocles when they were at first disliked and decried in the city as being rash and unrestrained. And there is also a story that when Demosthenes had met with a reverse in the assembly and was disheartened thereby, an aged man who had formerly heard Pericles speak touched him with his hand and told him that he resembled that great man in natural ability and, therefore, had been unjust in condemning himself. And so also when Timotheüs was hissed for being new-fangled and was said to be committing sacrilege upon music, Euripides told him to be of good courage, for in a little while the theatres would be at his feet. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p rend="indent">And in general, just as at Rome the Vestal Virgins have a definite time allotted them, first for learning, then for performing the traditional rites, and thirdly and lastly for teaching them, and as at Ephesus they call each one of the servants of Artemis first a novice, then a priestess, and thirdly an expriestess, so the perfect statesman engages in public affairs, first while still a learner and a neophyte and finally as a teacher and initiator. For although it is impossible for the overseer of other athletes to engage in contests himself, yet he who trains a young man in affairs of the community and political struggles and prepares him for the service of his country <quote rend="blockquote">Speaker of speeches to be and also a doer of actions,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> ix. 443.</note> </quote> <pb xml:id="v.10.p.143"/> is useful to the State in no small or mean degree, but helps towards that for which Lycurgus first and especially exerted himself when he accustomed the young always to obey every old man as if he were a lawgiver. For what had Lysander in mind when he said that men grow old most nobly in Lacedaemon? Was it because there the older men are more than elsewhere allowed to live in idleness and to lend money or sit together and throw dice or get together betimes for drinking-parties<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <emph rend="italic">Cf.</emph> Athenaeus 279 e and 365 c.</note>? You could not say that. No, it was because all men of advanced age hold more or less the position of magistrates, fatherly counsellors, or instructors, and not only oversee public affairs, but also make it their business to learn all details about the gymnasia, the sports, and the daily lives of the young men, and, therefore, they are feared by those who do wrong but revered and desired by the good; for the young men always cultivate and follow them, since they enhance and encourage the decorum and innate nobility of the young without arousing their envy. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p rend="indent">For the emotion of envy is not fitting for any time of life, but nevertheless it has among young people plenty of fine names, being called <q>competition,</q> <q>zeal,</q> and <q>ambition</q>; but in old men it is totally unseasonable, uncultured, and ignoble. Therefore the aged statesman, being far beyond the feeling of envy, should not, as envious old tree trunks clearly do, try to destroy and prevent the sprouting growth of the plants which spring up beside them and grow under them, but he should receive kindly those who claim his attention and attach themselves to him; he should offer himself to <pb xml:id="v.10.p.145"/> direct, guide, and support them, not only with good instructions and advice, but also by giving up to them public offices which bring honour and reputation, or certain public services which will do no harm to the people, but will be pleasing to it, and will make them popular. But as for such things as arouse opposition and are difficult and, like certain medicines, smart and hurt at first but produce an excellent and profitable result afterwards, he should not force young men into these and subject them to popular outcries while they are still unaccustomed to the inconsiderate mob; but he should himself assume the unpopularity arising from advantageous measures, for in this way he will make the young more well-disposed towards him and more eager in performing other services. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p rend="indent">But above all things we must remind them that statesmanship consists, not only in holding office, being ambassador, vociferating in the assembly, and ranting round the speakers’ platform proposing laws and making motions. Most people think all this is part of statesmanship, just as they think of course that those are philosophers who sit in a chair and converse and prepare their lectures over their books; but the continuous practice of statesmanship and philosophy, which is every day alike seen in acts and deeds, they fail to perceive. For, as Dicaearchus used to remark, those who circulate in the porticoes are said to be <q>promenading,</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This is a play on the name of the Peripatetic school of philosophy. <emph rend="italic">Cf.</emph> Müller, <title rend="italic">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> ii. p. 226.</note> but those who walk into the country or to see a friend are not. Now being a statesman is like being a philosopher. Socrates at any rate was a philosopher, although he did not <pb xml:id="v.10.p.147"/> set out benches or seat himself in an armchair or observe a fixed hour for conversing or promenading with his pupils, but jested with them, when it so happened, and drank with them, served in the army or lounged in the market-place with some of them, and finally was imprisoned and drank the poison. He was the first to show that life at all times and in all parts, in all experiences and activities, universally admits philosophy. So this is what we must understand concerning statesmanship also: that foolish men, even when they are generals or secretaries or public orators, do not act as statesmen, but court the mob, deliver harangues, arouse factions, or under compulsion perform public services; but that the man who is really public-spirited and who loves mankind and the State and is careful of the public welfare and truly statesmanlike, that man, although he never put on a uniform, is always acting as a statesman by urging those on who have power, guiding those who need guidance, assisting those who are deliberating, reforming those who act wrongly, encouraging those who are right-minded, making it plain that he is not just casually interested in public affairs and that he goes to the assembly or the council, not for the sake of getting the first seat when there is something serious in prospect or he is summoned, but that when he goes there he goes not merely for amusement as if to see or hear a performance, and that even when he is not there in person he is present in thought and through inquiry, thus approving of some of the proceedings and disapproving of others. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p rend="indent">For not even Aristeides was often ruler of the <pb xml:id="v.10.p.149"/> Athenians, nor Cato of the Romans, but they spent their whole lives in active service to their native States. And Epameinondas as general gained many great successes, but one deed of his equal to any of them is recorded, which he performed in Thessaly when he was neither general nor magistrate. The generals had led the phalanx into difficult ground and were in confusion (for the enemy were pressing them hard with missile weapons), when he was called out from his place among the infantry; and first by encouraging the army he put an end to confusion and fear, then, after arranging the broken phalanx and putting it in order, he easily led it out and drew it up to face the enemy, so that they changed front and withdrew. And when King Agis, in Arcadia, was already leading against the enemy his army drawn up for battle, one of the elder Spartiates called out to him that he was planning to cure evil with evil, pointing out that his present unseasonable eagerness was an attempt to atone for his culpable retreat from Argos, as Thucydides says.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Thucydides, v. 65. 2.</note> And when Agis heard this, he took the advice and retreated. For Menecrates a chair was placed every day by the door of the house of government, and often the ephors rose up from their session and went to him for information and advice on the most important matters; for he was considered to be a wise man and an intelligent one to be consulted. And therefore, after his physical strength had become utterly exhausted and he had to spend most of the day in bed, when the ephors sent for him to come to the market-place, he got up and set out to walk, <pb xml:id="v.10.p.151"/> but proceeded slowly and with difficulty; then, meeting some boys on the way, he asked them if they knew of anything stronger than the necessity of obeying one’s master, and they replied, <q>Not being able to.</q> Accounting this as the limit of his service, he turned round and went home. For a man’s zeal ought not to fail before his strength, but when it is deserted by strength, it should not be forced. Certainly Scipio, both as general and as statesman, always made use of Gaius Laelius as his adviser, so that some people even said that Scipio was the actor, but Gaius the author, of his deeds. And Cicero himself confesses that the noblest and greatest of the plans through which as consul he restored his country to safety were devised with the help of the philosopher Publius Nigidius. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p rend="indent">There are, then, many kinds of political activity by which old men may readily benefit the commonwealth by giving of their best, namely reason, judgement, frankness, and <q>sapience profound,</q> as poets say<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch seems to have no particular poet in mind, but merely indicates that he is using poetic diction.</note>; for not only do our hands or our feet or the strength of our body constitute a possession and a part of the State, but first of all our soul and the beauties of the soul - justice, moderation, and wisdom. And since these acquire their proper quality late and slowly, it is absurd that house, farm, and other property or possessions should derive all the benefit from aged men but that they should be no longer of use to their country in general and their fellow-citizens by reason of their age, for age does not so much diminish our power to perform <pb xml:id="v.10.p.153"/> inferior services as it increases our power for leading and governing.
