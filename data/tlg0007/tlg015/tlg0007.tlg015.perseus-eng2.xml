<p>The family of Alcibiades, it is thought, may be traced back to Eurysaces,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 1 121a">Plat. Alc. 1 121</bibl> </note> the son of Aias, as its founder; and on his mother’s side he was an Alcmaeonid, being the son of Deinomache, the daughter of Megacles. His father, Cleinias, fitted out a trireme at his own cost and fought it gloriously at Artemisium.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">480 B.C.</note> He was afterwards slain at Coroneia,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">447 B.C.</note> fighting the Boeotians, and Alcibiades was therefore reared as the ward of Pericles and Ariphron, the sons of Xanthippus, his near kinsmen.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">They were first cousins, once removed.</note> </p></div>

<p> It is said, and with good reason, that the favour and affection which Socrates showed him contributed not a little to his reputation. Certain it is that Nicias, Demosthenes, Lamachus, Phormio, Thrasybulus, and Theramenes were prominent men, and his contemporaries, and yet we cannot so much as name the mother of any one of them; whereas, in the case of Alcibiades, we even know that his nurse, who was a Spartan woman, was called Amycla, and his tutor Zopyrus. The one fact is mentioned by Antisthenes, the other by Plato.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 1 122b">Plat. Alc. 1 122</bibl> </note> </p></div>

<p> As regards the beauty of Alcibiades, it is perhaps unnecessary to say aught, except that it flowered out with each successive season of his bodily growth, and made him, alike in boyhood, youth and manhood, lovely and pleasant. The saying of Euripides,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Ael. VH 13.4">Aelian Var. Hist. 13.4</bibl> </note> that <quote>beauty’s autumn, too, is beautiful,</quote> is not always true. But it was certainly the case with Alcibiades, as with few besides, because of his excellent natural parts. </p></div>

<p> Even the lisp that he had became his speech, they say, and made his talk persuasive and full of charm. Aristophanes notices this lisp of his in the verses wherein he ridicules Theorus:— <quote type="translation"> <sp> <speaker>Sosias</speaker> <l>Then Alcibiades said to me with a lisp, said he,</l> <l><q>Cwemahk Theocwus?

<p> His character, in later life, displayed many inconsistencies and marked changes, as was natural amid his vast undertakings and varied fortunes. He was naturally a man of many strong passions, the mightiest of which were the love of rivalry and the love of preeminence. This is clear from the stories recorded of his boyhood. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:2" n="2">
<p> He was once hard pressed in wrestling, and to save himself from getting a fall, set his teeth in his opponent’s arms, where they clutched him, and was like to have bitten through them. His adversary, letting go his hold, cried: <q type="spoken">You bite, Alcibiades, as women do!</q> <q type="spoken">Not I,</q> said Alcibiades, <q type="spoken">but as lions do.</q> While still a small boy, he was playing knucklebones in the narrow street, and just as it was his turn to throw, a heavy-laden wagon came along. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:2" n="3">
<p> In the first place, he bade the driver halt, since his cast lay right in the path of the wagon. The driver, however, was a boorish fellow, and paid no heed to him, but drove his team along. Whereupon, while the other boys scattered out of the way, Alcibiades threw himself flat on his face in front of the team, stretched himself out at full length, and bade the driver go on if he pleased. At this the fellow pulled up his beasts sharply, in terror; the spectators, too, were affrighted, and ran with shouts to help the boy. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:2" n="4">
<p> At school, he usually paid due heed to his teachers, but he refused to play the flute, holding it to be an ignoble and illiberal thing. The use of the plectrum and the lyre, he argued, wrought no havoc with the bearing and appearance which were becoming to a gentleman; but let a man go to blowing on a flute, and even his own kinsmen could scarcely recognize his features. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:2" n="5">
<p> Moreover, the lyre blended its tones with the voice or song of its master; whereas the flute closed and barricaded the mouth, robbing its master both of voice and speech. <q type="spoken">Flutes, then,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">for the sons of Thebes; they know not how to converse. But we Athenians, as our fathers say, have Athena for foundress and Apollo for patron, one of whom cast the flute away in disgust, and the other flayed the presumptuous flute-player.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Athena threw away the flute because she saw her puffed and swollen cheeks reflected in the water of a spring. Marsyas the satyr was vanquished by Apollo in a musical contest, and was flayed alive.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:2" n="6">
<p> Thus, half in jest and half in earnest, Alcibiades emancipated himself from this discipline, and the rest of the boys as well. For word soon made its way to them that Alcibiades loathed the art of flute-playing and scoffed at its disciples, and rightly, too. Wherefore the flute was dropped entirely from the programme of a liberal education and was altogether despised. </p></div> </div>

<p> Among the calumnies which Antiphon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">An abusive oration of Antiphon the Rhamnusian against Alcibiades, cited in Athenaeus, p. 525b, was probably a fabrication and falsely attributed to him. It is not extant.</note> heaps upon him it is recorded that, when he was a boy, he ran away from home to Democrates, one of his lovers, and that Ariphron was all for having him proclaimed by town crier as a castaway. But Pericles would not suffer it. <q type="spoken">If he is dead,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">we shall know it only a day the sooner for the proclamation; whereas, if he is alive, he will, in consequence of it, be as good as dead for the rest of his life.</q> Antiphon says also that with a blow of his stick he slew one of his attendants in the palaestra of Sibyrtius. But these things are perhaps unworthy of belief, coming as they do from one who admits that he hated Alcibiades, and abused him accordingly. </p></div> </div>

<p> It was not long before many men of high birth clustered about him and paid him their attentions. Most of them were plainly smitten with his brilliant youthful beauty and fondly courted him. But it was the love which Socrates had for him that bore strong testimony to the boy’s native excellence and good parts. These Socrates saw radiantly manifest in his outward person, and, fearful of the influence upon him of wealth and rank and the throng of citizens, foreigners and allies who sought to preempt his affections by flattery and favour, he was fain to protect him, and not suffer such a fair flowering plant to cast its native fruit to perdition. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:4" n="2">
<p> For there is no man whom Fortune so envelops and compasses about with the so-called good things of life that he cannot be reached by the bold and caustic reasonings of philosophy, and pierced to the heart. And so it was that Alcibiades, although he was pampered from the very first, and was prevented by the companions who sought only to please him from giving ear to one who would instruct and train him, nevertheless, through the goodness of his parts, at last saw all that was in Socrates, and clave to him, putting away his rich and famous lovers. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:4" n="3">
<p> And speedily, from choosing such an associate, and giving ear to the words of a lover who was in the chase for no unmanly pleasures, and begged no kisses and embraces, but sought to expose the weakness of his soul and rebuke his vain and foolish pride, <quote rend="blockquote"> <l> <q type="written">He crouched, though warrior bird, like slave, with drooping wings.</q> </l> </quote> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The iamibc trimeter is of unknown authorship.</note> And he came to think that the work of Socrates was really a kind of provision of the gods for the care and salvation of youth. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:4" n="4">
<p> Thus, by despising himself, admiring his friend, loving that friend’s kindly solicitude and revering his excellence, he insensibly acquired an <quote>image of love,</quote> as Plato says,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 255">Plat. Phaedrus 255</bibl> </note> <quote>to match love,</quote> and all were amazed to see him eating, exercising, and tenting with Socrates,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 219e">Plat. Sym. 219e</bibl> </note> while he was harsh and stubborn with the rest of his lovers. Some of these he actually treated with the greatest insolence, as, for example, Anytus, the son of Anthemion. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:4" n="5">
<p> This man was a lover of his, who, entertaining some friends, asked Alcibiades also to the dinner. Alcibiades declined the invitation, but after having drunk deep at home with some friends, went in revel rout to the house of Anytus, took his stand at the door of the men’s chamber, and, observing the tables full of gold and silver beakers, ordered his slaves to take half of them and carry them home for him. He did not deign to go in, but played this prank and was off. The guests were naturally indignant, and declared that Alcibiades had treated Anytus with gross and overweening insolence. <q type="spoken">Not so,</q> said Anytus, <q type="spoken">but with moderation and kindness; he might have taken all there were: he has left us half.</q> </p></div> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2" n="5"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:5" n="1">

<p> He treated the rest of his lovers also after this fashion. There was one man, however, a resident alien, as they say, and not possessed of much, who sold all that he had, and brought the hundred staters which he got for it to Alcibiades, begging him to accept them. Alcibiades burst out laughing with delight at this, and invited the man to dinner. After feasting him and showing him every kindness, he gave him back his gold, and charged him on the morrow to compete with the farmers of the public revenues and outbid them all. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:5" n="2">
<p> The man protested, because the purchase demanded a capital of many talents; but Alcibiades threatened to have him scourged if he did not do it, because he cherished some private grudge against the ordinary contractors. In the morning, accordingly, the alien went into the market place and increased the usual bid for the public lands by a talent. The contractors clustered angrily about him and bade him name his surety, supposing that he could find none. The man was confounded and began to draw back, when Alcibiades, standing afar off, cried to the magistrates: <q type="spoken">put my name down; he is a friend of mine; I will be his surety.</q> </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:5" n="3">
<p> When the contractors heard this, they were at their wit’s end, for they were in the habit of paying what they owed on a first purchase with the profits of a second, and saw no way out of their difficulty. Accordingly, they besought the man to withdraw his bid, and offered him money so to do; but Alcibiades would not suffer him to take less than a talent. On their offering the man the talent, he bade him take it and withdraw. To this lover he was of service in such a way. </p></div> </div>

<p> But the love of Socrates, though it had many powerful rivals, somehow mastered Alcibiades. For he was of good natural parts, and the words of his teacher took hold of him and wrung his heart and brought tears to his eyes. But sometimes he would surrender himself to the flatterers who tempted him with many pleasures, and slip away from Socrates, and suffer himself to be actually hunted down by him like a runaway slave. And yet he feared and reverenced Socrates alone, and despised the rest of his lovers. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:6" n="2">
<p> It was Cleanthes who said that any one beloved of him must be <q type="emph">downed,</q> as wrestlers say, by the ears alone, though offering to rival lovers many other <q type="emph">holds</q> which he himself would scorn to take,—meaning the various lusts of the body. And Alcibiades was certainly prone to be led away into pleasure. That <quote>lawless self-indulgence</quote> of his, of which Thucydides speaks,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Thuc. 6.15.4">Thuc. 6.15.4</bibl> </note> leads one to suspect this. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:6" n="3">
<p> However, it was rather his love of distinction and love of fame to which his corrupters appealed, and thereby plunged him all too soon into ways of pre-sumptuous scheming, persuading him that he had only to enter public life, and he would straightway cast into total eclipse the ordinary generals and public leaders, and not only that, he would even surpass Pericles in power and reputation among the Hellenes. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:6" n="4">
<p> Accordingly, just as iron, which has been softened in the fire, is hardened again by cold water, and has its particles compacted together, so Alcibiades, whenever Socrates found him filled with vanity and wantonness, was reduced to shape by the Master’s discourse, and rendered humble and cautious.

The wanton deed was soon noised about the city, and everybody was indignant, as was natural.

<p> On Sicily the Athenians had cast longing eyes even while Pericles was living; and after his death they actually tried to lay hands upon it.

<p> But the man who finally fanned this desire of theirs into flame, and persuaded them not to attempt the island any more in part and little by little, but to sail thither with a great armament and subdue it utterly, was Alcibiades; he persuaded the people to have great hopes, and he himself had greater aspirations still. Such were his hopes that he regarded Sicily as a mere beginning, and not, like the rest, as an end of the expedition. </p></div>

The young men were at once carried away on the wings of such hopes, and their elders kept recounting in their ears many wonderful things about the projected expedition.

It was better to save his life by a false confession of crime, than to die a shameful death under a false charge of that crime.

Such was the passion that possessed the woman. But he, in his mocking way, said he had not done this thing for a wanton insult, nor at the behest of mere pleasure, but in order that descendants of his might be kings of the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>

<p> Such being the state of things, there were many to tell the tale to Agis, and he believed it, more especially owing to the lapse of time. There had been an earthquake, and he had run in terror out of his chamber and the arms of his wife, and then for ten months had had no further intercourse with her. And since Leotychides had been born at the end of this period, Agis declared that he was no child of his. For this reason Leotychides was afterwards refused the royal succession.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Lys. 22.4">Plut.

<p> After the Athenian disaster in Sicily,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">With these words the two years which had elapsed since the flight of Alcibiades (<bibl n="Plut.

But though the Boeotians supported the appeal of the Lesbians, and Pharnabazus that of the Cyzicenes, the Spartans, under the persuasion of Alcibiades, elected to help the Chians first of all. Alcibiades actually set sail in person and brought almost all Ionia to revolt, and, in constant association with the Lacedaemonian generals, wrought injury to the Athenians. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:24" n="2">
<p> But Agis was hostile to him because of the wrong he had suffered as a husband, and he was also vexed at the repute in which Alcibiades stood; for most of the successes won were due to him, as report had it. The most influential and ambitious of the other Spartans also were already envious and tired of him, and soon grew strong enough to induce the magistrates at home to send out orders to Ionia that he be put to death. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:24" n="3">
<p> His stealthy discovery of this put him on his guard, and while in all their undertakings he took part with the Lacedaemonians, he sedulously avoided coming into their hands. Then, resorting to Tissaphernes, the King’s satrap, for safety, he was soon first and foremost in that grandee’s favour. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:24" n="4">
<p> For his versatility and surpassing cleverness were the admiration of the Barbarian, who was no straightforward man himself, but malicious and fond of evil company. And indeed no disposition could resist and no nature escape Alcibiades, so full of grace was his daily life and conversation. Even those who feared and hated him felt a rare and winning charm in his society and presence. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:24" n="5">
<p> And thus it was that Tissaphernes, though otherwise the most ardent of the Persians in his hatred of the Hellenes, so completely surrendered to the flatteries of Alcibiades as to outdo him in reciprocal flatteries. Indeed, the most beautiful park he had, both for its refreshing waters and grateful lawns, with resorts and retreats decked out in regal and extravagant fashion, he named Alcibiades; everyone always called it by that name. </p></div> </div>

<p> Alcibiades now abandoned the cause of the Spartans, since he distrusted them and feared Agis, and began to malign and slander them to Tissaphernes. He advised him not to aid them very generously, and yet not to put down the Athenians completely, but rather by niggardly assistance to straiten and gradually wear out both, and so make them easy victims for the King when they had weakened and exhausted each other. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:25" n="2">
<p> Tissaphernes was easily persuaded, and all men saw that he loved and admired his new adviser, so that Alcibiades was looked up to by the Hellenes on both sides, and the Athenians repented themselves of the sentence they had passed upon him, now that they were suffering for it. Alcibiades himself also was presently burdened with the fear that if his native city were altogether destroyed, he might come into the power of the Lacedaemonians, who hated him. </p></div>

<p> At this time<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">During the winter of 412-411 B.C.</note> almost all the forces of Athens were at Samos. From this island as their naval base of operations they were trying to win back some of their Ionian allies who had revolted, and were watching others who were disaffected. After a fashion they still managed to cope with their enemies on the sea, but they were afraid of Tissaphernes and of the fleet of one hundred and fifty Phoenician triremes which was said to be all but at hand; if this once came up, no hope of safety was left for their city. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:25" n="4">
<p> Alcibiades was aware of this, and sent secret messages to the influential Athenians at Samos, in which he held out the hope that he might bring Tissaphernes over to be their friend. He did not seek, he said, the favour of the multitude, nor trust them, but rather that of the aristocrats, in case they would venture to show themselves men, put a stop to the insolence of the people, take the direction of affairs into their own hands, and save their cause and city. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:25" n="5">
<p> Now the rest of the aristocrats were much inclined to Alcibiades. But one of the generals, Phrynichus, of the deme Deirades, suspected (what was really the case) that Alcibiades had no more use for an oligarchy than for a democracy, but merely sought in one way or another a recall from exile, and therefore inveighed against the people merely to court betimes the favour of the aristocrats, and ingratiate himself with them. He therefore opposed him. When his opinion had been overborne and he was now become an open enemy of Alcibiades, he sent a secret message to Astyochus, the enemy’s naval commander bidding him beware of Alcibiades and arrest him, for that he was playing a double game.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:25" n="6">
<p> But without his knowing it, it was a case of traitor dealing with traitor. For Astyochus was much in awe of Tissaphernes, and seeing that Alcibiades had great power with the satrap, he disclosed the message of Phrynichus to them both. Alcibiades at once sent men to Samos to denounce Phrynichus. All the Athenians there were incensed and banded themselves together against Phrynichus, who, seeing no other escape from his predicament, attempted to cure one evil by another and a greater. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:25" n="7">
<p> He sent again to Astyochus, chiding him indeed for his disclosure of the former message, but announcing that he stood ready to deliver into his hands the fleet and army of the Athenians. However, this treachery of Phrynichus did not harm the Athenians at all, because of the fresh treachery of Astyochus. This second message of Phrynichus also he delivered to Alcibiades.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:25" n="8">
<p> But Phrynichus knew all the while that he would do so, and expected a second denunciation from Alcibiades. So he got the start of him by telling the Athenians himself that the enemy were going to attack them, and advising them to have their ships manned and their camp fortified.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:25" n="9">
<p> The Athenians were busy doing this when again a letter came from Alcibiades bidding them beware of Phrynichus, since he had offered to betray their fleet to the enemy. This letter they disbelieved at the time, supposing that Alcibiades, who must know perfectly the equipment and purposes of the enemy, had used his knowledge in order to calumniate Phrynichus falsely.</p></div>

<p> But at Samos the friends of Alcibiades soon got the upper hand, and sent Peisander to Athens to change the form of government. He was to encourage the leading men to overthrow the democracy and take control of affairs, with the plea that on these terms alone would Alcibiades make Tissaphernes their friend and ally. This was the pretence and this the pretext of those who established the oligarchy at Athens. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:26" n="2">
<p> But as soon as the so-called Five Thousand (they were really only four hundred) got the power and took control of affairs, they at once neglected Alcibiades entirely, and waged the war with less vigor, partly because they distrusted the citizens, who still looked askance at the new form of government, and partly because they thought that the Lacedaemonians, who always looked with favour on an oligarchy, would be more lenient towards them. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:26" n="3">
<p> The popular party in the city was constrained by fear to keep quiet, because many of those who openly opposed the Four Hundred had been slain. But when the army in Samos learned what had been done at home, they were enraged, and were eager to sail forthwith to the Piraeus, and sending for Alcibiades, they appointed him general, and bade him lead them in putting dwn the tyrants. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:26" n="4">
<p> An ordinary man, thus suddenly raised to great power by the favour of the multitude, would have been full of complaisance, thinking that he must at once gratify them in all things and oppose them in nothing, since they had made him, instead of a wandering exile, leader and general of such a fleet and of so large an armed force. But Alcibiades, as became a great leader, felt that he must oppose them in their career of blind fury, and prevented them from making a fatal mistake. Therefore in this instance, at least, he was the manifest salvation of the city. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:26" n="5">
<p> For had they sailed off home, their enemies might at once have occupied all Ionia, the Hellespont without a battle, and the islands, while Athenians were fighting Athenians and making their own city the seat of war. Such a war Alcibiades, more than any other one man, prevented, not only persuading and instructing the multitude together, but also, taking them man by man, supplicating some and constraining others.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:26" n="6">
<p> He had a helper, too, in Thrasybulus of Steiris,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This illustrious commander, the son of Lycus, is to be distinguished from Thrasybulus, the son of Thraso (<bibl n="Plut.

A second honorable proceeding of Alcibiades was his promising to bring over to their side the Phoenician ships which the King had sent out and the Lacedaemonians were expecting,-or at least to see that those expectations were not realized,—and his sailing off swiftly on this errand. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:26" n="7">
<p> The ships were actually seen off Aspendus, but Tissaphernes did not bring them up, and thereby played the Lacedaemonians false. Alcibiades, however, was credited with this diversion of the ships by both parties, and especially by the Lacedaemonians. The charge was that he instructed the Barbarian to suffer the Hellenes to destroy one another. For it was perfectly clear that the side to which such a naval force attached itself would rob the other altogether of the control of the sea. </p></div> </div>

<p> After this the Four Hundred were overthrown,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">They usurped the power in June, of 411 B.C.; they fell in September of the same year.</note> the friends of Alcibiades now zealously assisting the party of the people. Then the city willingly ordered Alcibiades to come back home. But he thought he must not return with empty hands and without achievement, through the pity and favour of the multitude, but rather in a blaze of glory. So, to begin with, he set sail with a small fleet from Samos and cruised off Cnidus and Cos. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:27" n="2">
<p> There he heard that Mindarus the Spartan admiral had sailed off to the Hellespont with his entire fleet, followed by the Athenians, and so he hastened to the assistance of their generals. By chance he came up, with his eighteen triremes, at just that critical point when both parties, having joined battle with all their ships off Abydos, and sharing almost equally in victory and defeat until evening, were locked in a great struggle. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:27" n="3">
<p> The appearance of Alcibiades inspired both sides with a false opinion of his coming: the enemy were emboldened and the Athenians were confounded. But he quickly hoisted Athenian colors on his flagship and darted straight upon the victorious and pursuing Peloponnesians. Routing them, he drove them to land, and following hard after them, rammed and shattered their ships. Their crews swam ashore, and here Pharnabazus came to their aid with his infantry and fought along the beach in defence of their ships. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:27" n="4">
<p> But finally the Athenians captured thirty of them, rescued their own, and erected a trophy of victory. Taking advantage of a success so brilliant as this, and ambitious to display himself at once before Tissaphernes, Alcibiades supplied himself with gifts of hospitality and friendship and proceeded, at the head of an imperial retinue, to visit the satrap. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:27" n="5">
<p> His reception, however, was not what he expected. Tissaphernes had for a long time been accused by the Lacedaemonians to the King, and being in fear of the King’s condemnation, it seemed to him that Alcibiades had come in the nick of time. So he arrested him and shut him up in Sardis, hoping that such an outrage upon him as this would dispel the calumnies of the Spartans. </p></div> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2" n="28">

<p> After the lapse of thirty days Alcibiades ran away from his guards, got a horse from some one or other, and made his escape to Clazomenae. To repay Tissaphernes, he alleged that he had escaped with that satrap’s connivance, and so brought additional calumny upon him. He himself sailed to the camp of the Athenians,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Early in the spring of 410 B.C. The Athenians were at Cardia, a city of the Thracian Chersonese.</note> where he learned that Mindarus, along with Pharnabazus, was in Cyzicus. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:28" n="2">
<p> Thereupon he roused the spirits of the soldiers, declaring that they must now do sea-fighting and land-fighting and even siege-fighting, too, against their enemies, for poverty stared them in the face unless they were victorious in every way. He then manned his ships and made his way to Proconnesus, giving orders at once to seize all small trading craft and keep them under guard, that the enemy might get no warning of his approach from any source so ever. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:28" n="3">
<p> Now it chanced that copious rain fell all of a sudden, and thunder-peals and darkness cooperated with him in concealing his design. Indeed, not only did he elude the enemy, but even the Athenians themselves had already given up all expectation of fighting, when he suddenly ordered them aboard ship and put out to sea. After a little the darkness cleared away, and the Peloponnesian ships were seen hovering off the harbor of Cyzicus. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:28" n="4">
<p> Fearing then lest they catch sight of the full extent of his array and take refuge ashore, he ordered his fellow-commanders to sail slowly and so remain in the rear, while he himself, with only forty ships, hove in sight and challenged the foe to battle. The Peloponnesians were utterly deceived, and scorning what they deemed the small numbers of their enemy, put out to meet them, and closed at once with them in a grappling fight. Presently, while the battle was raging, the Athenian reserves bore down upon their foe, who were panic stricken and took to flight. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:28" n="5">
<p> Then Alcibiades with twenty of his best ships broke though their line, put to shore, and disembarking his crews, attacked his enemy as they fled from their ships, and slew many of them. Mindarus and Pharnabazus, who came to their aid, he overwhelmed; Mindarus was slain fighting sturdily, but Pharnabazus made his escape.</p></div>

<p> Many were the dead bodies and the arms of which the Athenians became masters, and they captured all their enemy’s ships. Then they also stormed Cyzicus, which Pharnabazus abandoned to its fate, and the Peloponnesians in it were annihilated. Thus the Athenians not only had the Hellespont under their sure control, but even drove the Lacedaemonians at a stroke from the rest of the sea. A dispatch was captured announcing the disaster to the ephors in true laconic style: <q type="spoken">Our ships are lost; Mindarus is gone; our men are starving; we know not what to do.</q></p></div> </div>

<p> But the soldiers of Alcibiades were now so elated and filled with pride that they disdained longer to mingle with the rest of the army, since it had often been conquered, while they were unconquered. For not long before this,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">During the summer of 410 B.C., after the victory of Cyzicus.</note> Thrasyllus had suffered a reverse at Ephesus, and the Ephesians had erected their bronze trophy of victory, to the disgrace of the Athenians. </p></div>

<p> This was what the soldiers of Alcibiades cast in the teeth of Thrasyllus’ men, vaunting themselves and their general, and refusing to share either training or quarters in camp with them. But when Pharnabazus with much cavalry and infantry attacked the forces of Thrasyllus, who had made a raid into the territory of Abydos, Alcibiades sallied out to their aid, routed Pharnabazus, and pursued him till nightfall, along with Thrasyllus. Thus the two factions were blended, and returned to their camp with mutual friendliness and delight. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:29" n="3">
<p> On the following day Alcibiades set up a trophy of victory and plundered the territory of Pharnabazus, no one venturing to defend it. He even captured some priests and priestesses, but let them go without ransom. On setting out to attack Chalcedon, which had revolted from Athens and received a Lacedaemonian garrison and governor, he heard that its citizens had collected all their goods and chattels out of the country and committed them for safe keeping to the Bithynians, who were their friends. So he marched to the confines of Bithynia with his army, and sent on a herald with accusations and demands. The Bithynians, in terror, gave up the booty to him, and made a treaty of friendship. </p></div> </div>

<p> Then he sailed in person into the Hellespont and levied moneys there. He also captured Selymbria, where he exposed himself beyond all bounds. For there was a party in the city which offered to surrender it to him, and they had agreed with him upon the signal of a lighted torch displayed at midnight. But they were forced to give this signal before the appointed time, through fear of one of the conspirators, who suddenly changed his mind. So the torch was displayed before his army was ready; but Alcibiades took about thirty men and ran to the walls, bidding the rest of his force follow with all speed. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:30" n="3">
<p> The gate was thrown open for him and he rushed into the city, his thirty men-at-arms reinforced by twenty targeteers, but he saw at once that the Selymbrians were advancing in battle array to attack him. In resistance he saw no safety, and for flight, undefeated as he was in all his campaigns down to that day, he had too much spirit. He therefore bade the trumpet signal silence, and then ordered formal proclamation to be made that Selymbria must not bear arms against Athens. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:30" n="4">
<p> This proclamation made some of the Selymbrians less eager for battle, if, as they supposed, their enemies were all inside the walls; and others were mollified by hopes of a peaceful settlement. While they were thus parleying with one another, up came the army of Alcibiades. Judging now, as was really the case, that the Selymbrians were disposed for peace, he was afraid that his Thracian soldiers might plunder the city. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015.perseus-eng2:30" n="5">
<p> There were many of these, and they were zealous in their service, through the favour and good will they bore Alcibiades.

<p> Meanwhile the Athenian generals who were besieging Chalcedon made peace with Pharnabazus on condition that they receive a sum of money, that Chalcedon be subject again to Athens, that the territories of Pharnabazus be not ravaged, and that the said Pharnabazus furnish safe escort for an Athenian embassy to the King. </p></div>

<p> Accordingly, when Alcibiades came back from Selymbria, Pharnabazus demanded that he too take oath to the treaty; but Alcibiades refused to do so until Pharnabazus had taken his oath to it. After the oaths had been taken, he went up against Byzantium, which was in revolt against Athens, and compassed the city with a wall.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">During the winter of 409-408 B.C.</note> But after Anaxilaus, Lycurgus, and certain men besides had agreed to surrender the city to him on condition that it be not plundered, he spread abroad the story that threatening complications in Ionia called him away.

<p> but in the night time stealthily returned. He disembarked with the men-at-arms under his own command, and stationed himself quietly within reach of the city’s walls. His fleet, meanwhile, sailed to the harbor, and forcing its way in with much shouting and tumult and din, terrified the Byzantians by the unexpectedness of its attack, while it gave the party of Athens in the city a chance to admit Alcibiades in all security, since everybody had hurried off to the harbor and the fleet. </p></div>

<p> However, the day was not won without a battle. The Peloponnesians, Boeotians and Megarians who were in garrison at Byzantium routed the ships’ crews and drove them back on board again. Then, perceiving that the Athenians were inside the city, they formed in battle array and advanced to attack them. A fierce battle followed, but Alcibiades was victorious with the right wing, as well as Theramenes with the left, and they took prisoners no less than three hundred of the enemy who survived. </p></div>

<p> Not a man of the Byzantians was put to death or sent into exile after the battle, for it was on these conditions that the men who surrendered the city had acted, and this was the agreement with them; they exacted no special grace for themselves. Therefore it was that when Anaxilaus was prosecuted at Sparta for treachery, his words showed clearly that his deeds had not been disgraceful. He said that he was not a Lacedaemonian, but a Byzantian, and it was not Sparta that was in peril. Considering therefore the case of Byzantium, he saw that the city was walled up, that no help could make its way in,</p></div>

He had, therefore, not betrayed the city to its enemies, but set it free from war and its horrors, therein imitating the noblest Lacedaemonians, in whose eyes the one unqualifiedly honorable and righteous thing is their country’s good. The Lacedaemonians, on hearing this, were moved with sincere respect, and acquitted the men.</p></div> </div>

For he had put into harbor on the very day when the Plynteria of the goddess Athena were being celebrated.

<p> Ever since Deceleia had been fortified, and the enemy, by their presence there, commanded the approaches to Eleusis, the festal rite had been celebrated with no splendor at all, being conducted by sea.

<p> Accordingly, it seemed to Alcibiades that it would be a fine thing, enhancing his holiness in the eyes of the gods and his good repute in the minds of men, to restore its traditional fashion to the sacred festival by escorting the rite with his infantry along past the enemy by land. He would thus either thwart and humble Agis, if the king kept entirely quiet, or would fight a fight that was sacred and approved by the gods, in behalf of the greatest and holiest interests, in full sight of his native city, and with all his fellow citizens eye-witnesses of his valor. </p></div>
