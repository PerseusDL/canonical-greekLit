<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <p rend="indent">Clothes are supposed to make a man warm, not of course by warming him themselves in the sense of adding their warmth to him, because each garment by itself is cold, and for this reason very often persons who feel hot and feverish keep changing from one set of clothes to another; but the warmth which a man gives off from his own person the clothing, closely applied to the body, confines and enwraps, and does not allow it, when thus imprisoned in the body, to be dissipated again. Now the same condition existing in human affairs deceives most people, who think that, if they surround themselves with vast houses, and get together a mass of slaves and money, they shall live pleasantly.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 99 E, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra.</foreign> </note> But a pleasant and happy life comes not from external things, but, on the contrary, man draws on his own character as a source <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A dictum of Zeno’s; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 477 A, and Von Arnim, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Stoicorum veterum fragmenta</foreign>, i. p. 50.</note> from which to add the element of pleasure and joy to the things which surround him.

No, his vice, a settled tenant of his very vitals always, both at night and by day, <quote rend="blockquote">Burns, but without e’er a brand, and consigns to an eld all untimely.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hesiod, <title rend="italic">Works and Days,</title> 705.</note> </quote> For in travelling vice is a troublesome companion because of arrogance, at dinner an expensive companion owing to gluttony, and a distressing bedfellow, since by anxieties, cares and jealousies it drives out and destroys sleep. For what slumber there may be is sleep and repose for the body only, but for the soul terrors, dreams, and agitations, because of superstition. <pb xml:id="v.2.p.99"/> <quote rend="blockquote">When grief o’ertakes me as I close my eyes, I’m murdered by my dreams.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From some poet of the new comedy; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Kock, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Com. Att. Frag.</title> iii. p. 444, Adespota, No. 185.</note> </quote> says one man. In such a state do envy, fear, temper, and licentiousness put a man. For by day vice, looking outside of itself and conforming its attitude to others, is abashed and veils its emotions, and does not give itself up completely to its impulses, but oftentimes resists them and struggles against them; but in the hours of slumber, when it has escaped from opinion and law, and got away as far as possible from feeling fear or shame, it sets every desire stirring, and awakens its depravity and licentiousness. It <q>attempts incest,</q> as Plato <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, p. 571 D.</note> says, partakes of forbidden meats, abstains from nothing which it wishes to do, but revels in lawlessness so far as it can, with images and visions which end in no pleasure or accomplishment of desire, but have only the power to stir to fierce activity the emotional and morbid propensities.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 83 A, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra.</foreign> </note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> <p rend="indent">Where, then, is the pleasure in vice, if in no part of it is to be found freedom from care and grief, or contentment or tranquillity or calm? For a wellbalanced and healthy condition of the body gives room for engendering the pleasures of the flesh; but in the soul lasting joy and gladness cannot possibly be engendered, unless it provide itself first with cheerfulness, fearlessness, and courageousness as a basis to rest upon, or as a calm tranquillity that no billows disturb; otherwise, even though some hope or delectation lure us with a smile, anxiety suddenly breaks <pb xml:id="v.2.p.101"/> forth, like a hidden rock appearing in fair weather, and the soul is overwhelmed and confounded. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> <p rend="indent">Heap up gold, amass silver, build stately promenades, fill your house with slaves and the city with your debtors; unless you lay level the emotions of your soul, put a stop to your insatiate desires, and quit yourself of fears and anxieties, you are but decanting wine for a man in a fever, offering honey to a bilious man, and preparing tid-bits and dainties for sufferers from colic or dysentery, who cannot retain them or be strengthened by them, but are only brought nearer to death thereby. Does not your observation of sick persons teach you that they dislike and reject and decline the finest and costliest viands which their attendants offer and try to force upon them; and then later, when their whole condition has changed, and good breathing, wholesome blood, and normal temperature have returned to their bodies, they get up and have joy and satisfaction in eating plain bread with cheese and cress?<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 466 D.</note> It is such a condition that reason creates in the soul. You will be contented with your lot if you learn what the honourable and good is. You will be luxurious in poverty, and live like a king, and you will find no less satisfaction in the care-free life of a private citizen than in the life connected with high military or civic office. If you become a philosopher, you will live not unpleasantly, but you will learn to subsist pleasantly anywhere and with any resources. Wealth will give you gladness for the good you will do to many, poverty for your freedom from many cares, repute for the honours you will enjoy, and obscurity for the certainty that you shall not be envied. </p> </div> </div>
