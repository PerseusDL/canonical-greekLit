<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent"> The subject of this essay is not the emotion of anger itself, but the cure best applicable to the passion. In form it is a dialogue, but, apart from the beginning and the end, it is as undramatic as the later works of Plato. The principal speaker, Fundanus, treats the subject in a manner partly general and partly specific, and concludes with a pleasant history of his own cure. Hirzel (<title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der Dialog</title>, ii. p. 170) has described the work as a monument (<foreign xml:lang="deu">Ehrendenkmal</foreign>) to the memory of Fundanus, dedicated to Sulla. </p>
<p rend="indent"> Scholars concerned in the investigation of the sources used by Plutarch for this discourse have arrived at varying results: some<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Wilamowitz, <title rend="italic" >Hermes</title>, xxix. 152; Schlemm, <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxxviii. 587 ff.</note> have imagined that Stoic writers were used, others<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Allers, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Senecae Librorum de Ira Fontibus</title>, p. 9; Pohlenz, <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxxi. 321 ff.; accepted by Daebritz, <title rend="italic">RE</title>, i. 8. 1562. In <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xl. 292, note 1, Pohlenz attempts to refute Schlemm’s arguments.</note> that the Peripatetic Hieronymus of Rhodes was Plutarch’s principal authority. The numerous parallels to Seneca’s <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ira</title> have been used by both parties to substantiate their theories, but it is more likely that Plutarch, while borrowing numerous <foreign xml:lang="lat">loci communes</foreign> and examples <pb xml:id="v.6.p.91"/> from earlier writers,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Books on <q>Anger</q> were very plentiful in Cicero’s day (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Epp. ad Quint. Frat.</title>, i. 1. 37).</note> constructed for himself the main features of the dialogue. The self-portrayal of Fundanus and his cure, the frame-work of the whole discourse, is clearly Plutarch’s own device. The author’s debt to preceding literature is, as always, immense, yet the creation of such a work as this is by selection and arrangement; and for that Plutarch is alone responsible. </p>
<p rend="indent"> The essay was known to Aulus Gellius (i. 26), who relates a pleasant anecdote of Plutarch and a rascally slave who ventured to reprove the philosopher for his anger. Among English writers Jeremy Taylor has made admirable use of the essay by paraphrase and even translation, in his <title rend="italic">Holy Living</title>, iv. 8. </p>
<p rend="indent"> The ms. tradition is good.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >There is extant also a free Syriac translation (ed. Lagarde, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Analecta Syriaca</title>, Leipzig, 1858) which helps occasionally in the constitution of the text.</note> The work is apparently missing in the Lamprias catalogue, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ ὀργῆς</foreign> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Patzig, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Quaest. Plut.</title>, p. 42.</note> (No. 93) almost certainly refers to a different work from which Stobaeus has preserved a fragment (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 138). </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.6.p.93"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <p rend="indent"> (Speakers in the Dialogue: Sulla and Fundanus) </p>
<p rend="indent"> <said who="#Sulla"><label>SULLA.</label> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Sextius Sulla, a friend of Plutarch (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 636 a, and <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Prosopographia Imperii Romani</title>, iii. p. 239).</note> A good plan, as it seems to me, Fundanus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">C. Minicius Fundanus, a friend of Pliny (<title rend="italic" >Epp.</title>, v. 16); <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf<title rend="italic">. Pros. Imp. Rom.</title></foreign>, ii. p. 377.</note> is that which painters follow: they scrutinize their productions from time to time before they finish them. They do this because, by withdrawing their gaze and by inspecting their work often, they are able to form a fresh judgement, and one which is more likely to seize upon any slight discrepancy, such as the familiarity of uninterrupted contemplation will conceal. Since, therefore, it is impossible for a man to contemplate himself from time to time by getting apart from himself and interrupting his consciousness of himself by breaking its continuity (and this is what, more than anything else, makes every man a poorer judge of himself than of others), the next best course would be for him to inspect his friends from time to time and likewise to offer himself to them, not to see if he is grown old suddenly or if his body is better or worse, but for them to examine both his behaviour and his character to learn whether time has added some excellence or taken away some vice. As for me, since I have returned to Rome after a year’s absence and this is now the fifth month that I have been with you constantly, I do not <pb xml:id="v.6.p.95"/> find it altogether surprising that, of the virtues which were already yours by gift of Nature, there has been so great an increment and increase; but when I see that that violent and fiery tendency of yours toward anger has become so gentle and submissive to reason, it occurs to me to say with reference to your temper <quote rend="blockquote">O wonder, how much milder has it grown!<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, xxii. 373.</note> </quote> Yet this mildness has brought about no inactivity or feebleness in you, but, like the earth when it has been subdued by cultivation, it has received a smoothness and depth conducive to fruitful action in place of that impetuousness of yours and quickness of temper. For that reason it is evident that the spirited part of your soul is not withering away through any abatement of vigour caused by age, nor yet spontaneously, but that it is receiving the skilful treatment of some excellent precepts. And yet - for I shall tell you the plain truth - when our friend Eros<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >This friend of Plutarch is mentioned again in connexion with Fundanus in 464 e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> told me all this, I suspected that he was bearing witness, by reason of his goodwill, to qualities that were not actually present in you, yet should be so in men of breeding, although, as you know, he is by no means the sort of man to surrender his own opinion as a favour to anyone. But as things are, Eros stands acquitted of the charge of bearing false witness, and do you, since our journey<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Hirzel, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der Dialog</title>, ii. p. 168, note 4.</note> gives us leisure for conversation, tell me, as though you were recounting some medical treatment, what remedy you used that you have made your temper so obedient to the rein and tender-mouthed, so mild and subservient to reason. </said></p>
<p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus"><label>FUNDANUS.</label>  Well, what about you, my generous friend Sulla? Are you careful not to let your <pb xml:id="v.6.p.97"/> goodwill and friendship for me make you overlook some of my real qualities? For since on many occasions not even Eros himself can keep his temper in its place in that Homeric<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title>, xx. 23, cited in full 506 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> obedience, but when it becomes too exasperated through hatred of evil, it is reasonable to suppose that I appear more gentle to him, just as in changes of key certain high notes assume the position of low notes in contrast with other high notes.</said></p>
<p rend="indent"> <said who="#Sulla"><label>SULLA.</label>  Neither of these suppositions is true, Fundanus. Please do as I ask. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus"><label>FUNDANUS.</label>  One of those excellent precepts of Musonius<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 36 ed. Hense.</note> which I remember, Sulla, is: <q>He that wishes to come through life safe and sound must continue throughout his life to be under treatment.</q> For I do not think that reason should be used in one’s cure as we use hellebore, and be washed out of the body together with the disease, but it must remain in the soul and keep watch and ward over the judgements. For the power of reason is not like drugs, but like wholesome food, engendering an excellent state, together with great vigour, in those who become accustomed to it; but exhortations and admonitions, if applied to the passions when they are at their height and swollen, can scarcely accomplish anything at all, and that with difficulty. They are no better than those aromatic preparations which rouse epileptics when they lie prostrate, but do not rid them of the disease. Yet the other passions, even at their height, do in some sort yield and admit reason, when it comes from without to the rescue, <pb xml:id="v.6.p.99"/> into the soul; but temper does not, as Melanthius<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 760; quoted again in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 551 a. The poet is not the Athenian tragic poet, but Melanthius of Rhodes (<foreign xml:lang="lat">circa</foreign> 150 b.c.), according to Wilamowitz, <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxix. 150 ff.</note> says, <quote rend="blockquote">Shunt off the mind, and then do dreadful deeds,</quote> but on the contrary, it shuts out sense completely and locks it out, and just like those who burn themselves up in their own homes, it makes everything within full of confusion and smoke and noise, so that the soul can neither see nor hear anything that might help it. For this reason a ship deserted by her crew in the midst of a storm far out at sea<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 1103 c.</note> will more easily be able to take on a pilot from the outside, than will a man who is being tossed upon the billows of passion and anger admit the reasoning of another, unless he has his own powers of reason prepared to receive it. But just as those who expect a siege collect and store up all that is useful to them if they despair of relief from without, so it is most important that we should acquire far in advance the reinforcements which philosophy provides against temper and convey them into the soul in the knowledge that, when the occasion for using them comes, it will not be possible to introduce them with ease. For the soul hears nothing from the outside because of its tumult unless it has its own reason within, which, like a boatswain who directs the rowers, will promptly catch and understand every order given. Yet if the soul has heard words of advice which have been quietly and mildly spoken, it despises them; and toward any who insist in a rougher fashion, it grows exasperated. In fact, temper is overbearing and stubborn and altogether difficult for anyone other than itself to move, and, like a well-fortified tyranny, <pb xml:id="v.6.p.101"/> must have its destroyer born and bred in the same household. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> To be sure, when anger persists and its outbursts are frequent, there is created in the soul an evil state which is called irascibility,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 411 b-c.</note> and this usually results in sudden outbursts of rage, moroseness, and peevishness when the temper becomes ulcerated, easily offended, and liable to find fault for even trivial offences, like a weak, thin piece of iron which is always getting scratched. But if judgement at once opposes the fits of anger and represses them, it not only cures them for the present, but for the future also it renders the soul firm and difficult for passion to attack. In my own case, at any rate, when I had opposed anger two or three times, it came about that I experienced what the Thebans did, who, when they had for the first time<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">At the battle of Leuctra, 371 b.c.</note> repulsed the Spartans, who had the reputation of being invincible, were never thereafter defeated by them in any battle; for I acquired the proud consciousness that it is possible for reason to conquer. Not only did I see that anger ceases when cold water is sprinkled on it, as Aristotle<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This is apparently from a lost work, though not included in Rose’s collection of fragments. In <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Problemata</title>, x. 60 (898 a 4), however, Aristotle observes that fear is a process of cooling; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> also <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Partibus Animalium</title>, ii. 4 (651 a 8 ff.).</note> says, but that it is also extinguished when a poultice of fear is applied to it. And, by Heaven, if joy comes on the scene, in the case of many the temper has been quickly <q>warmed,</q> as Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, xxiii. 598, 600, <foreign xml:lang="lat">al.</foreign>; for Plutarch’s interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰαίνεσθαι</foreign> see <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 947 d: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλέαν τῷ σώματι μεθ’ ἡδονῆς, ὅπερ Ὅμηρος ἰαίνεσθαι κέκληκεω</foreign>; see also <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 735 f.</note> says, or dissipated. Consequently I came to the opinion that this passion is not altogether incurable, for those, at least, who wish to cure it. </said></p>
<p rend="indent"> <said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> For anger does not always have great and powerful beginnings; on the contrary, even a jest, a playful <pb xml:id="v.6.p.103"/> word, a burst of laughter or a nod on the part of somebody, and many things of the kind, rouse many persons to anger; just as Helen, by thus addressing her niece, <quote rend="blockquote" >Electra, virgin for so long a time,</quote> provoked her to reply, <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Too late you’re wise; but once you left your home </l> <l>Disgraced.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic">Orestes</title>, 72, 99.</note> </l> </quote> And so was Alexander provoked by Callisthenes,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 623 f - 624 a; Athenaeus, x. 434 d.</note> who said, when the great bowl was going its rounds, <q>I do not care to have a drink of Alexander and then have to call in Asclepius.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A jibe at Alexander’s assumed divinity, <q>Alexander</q> taking the place of Dionysus, the wine god, until the physician god, Asclepius, would have to be called in; on the authenticity of the story see Macurdy, <title rend="italic" >Jour. Hell. Stud.</title>, 1. (1930), 294-297.</note> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> And so, just as it is an easy matter to check a flame which is being kindled in hare’s fur<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 138 f.</note> or candlewicks or rubbish, but if it ever takes hold of solid bodies having depth, it quickly destroys and consumes <quote rend="blockquote">With youthful vigour lofty craftsmen’s work,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 107, Frag. 357.</note> </quote> as Aeschylus has it; so the man who at the beginning gives heed to his temper and observes it while it is still smoking and catching flame little by little from some gossip or rubbishy scurrility need have no great concern about it; on the contrary, he has often succeeded in extinguishing it merely by keeping silent and ignoring it. For he who gives no fuel to fire puts it out, and likewise he who does not in the beginning nurse his wrath and does not puff himself up with anger takes precautions against it and destroys it. I was therefore not satisfied with what <pb xml:id="v.6.p.105"/> Hieronymus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Of Rhodes, Peripatetic philosopher of the third century b.c.</note> says - although he contributes other useful remarks and advice - in the passage where he declares that we have no perception of anger when it comes into being, but only when it has already come into being and exists, the reason being the swiftness with which it acts. For the truth is that none of the emotions, at the time when they are gathering and beginning to move, has a birth and increase so easy to perceive.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">But <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Amore</title>, 4 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 134).</note> Indeed Homer also skilfully teaches us this lesson when he causes Achilles to be suddenly overwhelmed by grief on receiving the report,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Of Patroclus’s death, brought by Antilochus: <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, xviii. 22.</note> in the passage where the poet says: <quote rend="blockquote">He spoke, and a black cloud of grief closed round Achilles;</quote> but Homer portrays Achilles as being slow to lose his temper with Agamemnon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, i. 101 ff.</note> and as becoming inflamed only when many words had been spoken. Yet if either one of the men had held back their words at the beginning and prevented their utterance, the quarrel would not have had so great a growth or have reached such magnitude. That is the reason why Socrates,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Seneca, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ira</title>, iii. 13. 3.</note> as often as he perceived himself being moved to too great harshness against any of his friends, betaking himself to coast <quote rend="blockquote">Before the storm along some promontory,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Author unknown: Bergk, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Poet.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> For the first way, my friend, to dethrone temper <pb xml:id="v.6.p.107"/> as you would a tyrant, is not to oey or hearken when it bids us cry aloud and look fierce and beat our breasts, but to keep quiet and not intensify the passion, as we would a disease, by tossing about and making a clamour. It is quite true that lovers’ practices, such as serenading in concert or alone and crowning the beloved’s door with garlands, do in some way or other bring an alleviation that is not without charm or grace: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I came, but did not shout your name or race; </l> <l>I merely kissed the door. If this be sin, Then I have sinned.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Callimachus, <title rend="italic">Epigram</title> 43 (42), vv. 5, 6 (<title rend="italic">Anth. Pal.</title>, xii. 118). <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Propertius, ii. 30. 24: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Hoc si crimen erit, crimen amoris erit</foreign>.</note> </l> </quote> So too the surrender of mourners to weeping and wailing carries away much of their grief together with their tears. But temper is the more readily fanned into flame by what people in that state do and say.</said> </p>
<p rend="indent"> <said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> The best course, therefore, is for us to compose ourselves, or else to run away and conceal ourselves, and anchor ourselves in a calm harbour, as though we perceived a fit of epilepsy coming on,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Seneca, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ira</title>, iii. 10. 3.</note> so that we may not fall, or rather may not fall upon others; and we are especially likely to fall most often upon our friends. For we do not love or envy or fear everyone indiscriminately, but there is nothing that temper will not touch and assail: we grow angry with enemies and friends, with children and parents, yes, even with the gods, with wild beasts and soulless implements, as Thamyris did: <quote rend="blockquote">Breaking the lyre-arms, overlaid with gold, Breaking his melodious, taut-strung lyre<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag.

And Xerxes not only branded and lashed the sea,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, vii. 35.</note> but also sent a letter to Mount Athos<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Contrast <foreign xml:lang="lat">ibid.</foreign> vii. 24.</note>: <q type="unspecified" >Noble Athos, whose summit reaches heaven, do not put in the way of my deeds great stones difficult to work. Else I shall hew you down and cast you into the sea.</q> For temper can do many terrible things, and likewise many that are ridiculous; therefore it is both the most hated and the most despised of the passions. It will be useful to consider it in both of these aspects. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> As for me - whether rightly I do not know - I made this start in the treatment of my anger: I began to observe the passion in others, just as the Spartans used to observe in the Helots<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 239 a, and the note.</note> what a thing drunkenness is. And first, as Hippocrates<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Prognosticon</title>, 2 (vol. l. p. 79 ed.

For no envy or fear or rivalry enters into our relations with them, but frequent fits of anger bring about many conflicts and errors, and because of the absolute power we possess, there being no one to oppose or prevent us, these cause us to slide and fall, since we are, as it were, on slippery ground. For it is impossible that irresponsible power under the influence of passion should be free from error, unless he who wields this power shall encompass it with a bulwark of gentleness, and shall hold out against many pleas of wife and friends, all charging him with laxity and easy-going ways. By such charges I myself used to be very greatly exasperated against my slaves, in the conviction that they were being ruined by not being punished. At long last, however, though late it was, I came to perceive that, in the first place, it is better to make them worse by forbearance than by harshness and anger to pervert my own self for the correction of the others. In the second place, when I observed that many, just because they were not being punished, were often ashamed to be bad, and made pardon, rather than correction, the starting-point of reformation, and, I swear, performed their duties more zealously for the kind of master who gave orders silently with a nod than for the others who used blows and branding-irons, I began to be convinced that reason is more fit than anger to govern.

For both the passage of time gives a pause to passion and a delay which dissolves it, and also the judgement discovers a suitable manner of punishment and an adequate amount; furthermore, the man who suffers punishment has no pretext left for opposing the correction if punishment is inflicted, not in anger, but after the accused has been proved guilty; and finally, the most shameful thing is avoided-that the slave should seem to be making a juster plea than his master. </said></p>

And yet these are the very things which cause us to be excited and in a cruel and implacable mood at the moment they happen and are still fresh in our memory. For as the shapes of persons seen through a fog, so things seen through a mist of rage appear greater than they are.</said> </p>
<p rend="indent"> <said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> These are the reasons why we should immediately call to mind such instances and precepts; and when we are free from all suspicion of passion, if the offence still appears evil to the clear and settled judgement, we should attend to it then and not dismiss or abandon the punishment, as we leave food when we have lost our appetite. And nothing is so much the cause of our punishing in a rage as that, when our anger is over, we do not punish, but leave things alone. We are very much like lazy oarsmen, who during calm weather lie in port, and later, at the risk of their lives, avail themselves of a wind to go sailing. And so do we condemn reason for remissness and softness in punishment and hasten on to the deed rashly and to our peril when anger, like a gale, is upon us. For while a hungry man indulges in food as nature dictates, yet punishment is indulged in by one who is not hungry or thirsty for it, nor does he need anger as a relish to stimulate him to punish; on the contrary, when he finds himself very far removed from the desire to <pb xml:id="v.6.p.137"/> punish, he brings up reason to reinforce him and punishes under compulsion. Aristotle<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 608 ed. Rose.</note> relates that in Etruria in his day slaves were scourged to the music of pipes. But one should not, in that spirit, through a craving for the punishment as for a kind of enjoyment, gorge oneself with it, and rejoice while inflicting chastisement and after inflicting it repent<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 550 e, where the whole context may be compared with this chapter. See also Seneca, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ira</title>, i. 17-18.</note> - of these the first is bestial, the second womanish - but without either sorrow or pleasure one should mete out punishment in reason’s own good time, leaving anger no excuse. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> However this, perhaps, will not appear to be a cure for anger, but a temporary reprieve and prophylactic<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the phrase <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 420 e.</note> against those errors which some men commit in anger. And yet, though the swelling of the spleen is but a symptom of fever, reducing it assuages the fever, as Hieronymus says. But when I contemplated the origin of anger itself, I observed that different persons are liable to anger from different causes; yet in the case of practically all of them there is present a belief that they are being despised or neglected.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aristotle, <title rend="italic">Rhetoric</title>, ii. 3 (1380 a 8 ff.).</note> For this reason we should assist those who endeavour to avoid anger, by removing as far as possible the act that rouses wrath from any suspicion of contempt or arrogance and by imputing it to ignorance or necessity or emotion or mischance. So Sophocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Antigone</title>, 563-564; quoted with the same textual variants in the <title rend="italic">Life of Phocion</title>, i.

But the man in a rage should not wait for such humility, but should take to himself the reply of Diogenes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign><title rend="italic">. Life of Fabius Maximus</title>, x. (179 f); Diogenes Laertius, vi. 54.</note>: when someone said to him, <q type="unspecified" >They are laughing at you, Diogenes,</q> he answered, <q>But I am not laughed down.</q> Just so the angry man should not consider himself despised, but rather despise the man who gave the offence as acting from weakness or rashness, carelessness or illiberality, dotage or childishness. But such a notion must not on any account be entertained toward servants or friends; for our servants presume on our upright character, our friends on our affection, and both disregard us, not as being impotent or ineffectual, but because of our reasonableness or our goodwill. As it is, thinking ourselves despised, we not only treat harshly wife and slaves and friends, but also through rage often fall out with innkeepers and sailors and drunken muleteers; we even rage against dogs that bark at us and asses that jostle us,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 563 c.</note> like the man who wished to beat the assdriver, but when the driver cried out, <q>I am an Athenian,</q> indicated the ass and said, <q>You at any rate are not an Athenian,</q> and fell to beating it with many blows. <pb xml:id="v.6.p.141"/> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> Furthermore it is especially selfishness and peevishness, together with luxury and softness, which beget in us those continuous or oft-recurring fits of anger that are gathered together in the soul little by little, like a swarm of bees or wasps. And so there is nothing more conducive to gentleness than graciousness and simplicity toward servants and wife and friends if a man is able to get along with what comforts he has and is in no need of many superfluities: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But he who liked his meat not overdone </l> <l>Nor underdone, nor medium, nor boiled </l> <l>Too much; and liked no food enough to praise<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com.

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label>  For we should receive our friends affably and with laughter and cheerful friendliness, not with frowning brows, or striking fear and trembling into our servants. We must, further, accustom ourselves to make cheerful use of any kind of table utensils and not to prefer this service to that, as some men do <pb xml:id="v.6.p.145"/> who select one goblet or horn out of the many they have, and will drink from no other, as they relate of Marius. Some have this same feeling about oil-flasks and strigils, of which they have a liking for but one out of many; and so when one of these preferred objects is broken or lost, they take it hard and punish severely. Therefore anyone who is prone to anger should abstain from rare and curiously wrought things, like drinking-cups and seal-rings and precious stones; for their loss drives their owner out of his senses more than do objects which are easily procured and may be seen everywhere. This is the reason why, when Nero had had an octagonal tent built, a huge structure which was a sight to be seen because of its beauty and costliness, Seneca remarked, <q>You have proved yourself a poor man, for if you ever lose this you will not have the means to procure another like it,</q> And indeed it did so happen that the ship which conveyed it was sunk and the tent lost.

Thus neither marriage nor friendship is tolerable if anger is there, but without anger even <pb xml:id="v.6.p.147"/> drunkenness is easily borne.
