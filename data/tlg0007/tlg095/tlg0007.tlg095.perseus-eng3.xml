					<head>INTRODUCTION</head>
				<p rend="indent"> The subject of this essay is not the emotion of anger itself, but the cure best
					applicable to the passion. In form it is a dialogue, but, apart from the
					beginning and the end, it is as undramatic as the later works of Plato. The
					principal speaker, Fundanus, treats the subject in a manner partly general and
					partly specific, and concludes with a pleasant history of his own cure. Hirzel
						(<title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der Dialog</title>, ii. p. 170) has described the work as a
					monument (<foreign xml:lang="deu">Ehrendenkmal</foreign>) to the memory of Fundanus,
					dedicated to Sulla. </p>
				<p> Scholars concerned in the investigation of the sources used by Plutarch for this
					discourse have arrived at varying results: some<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">Wilamowitz, <title rend="italic"
							>Hermes</title>, xxix. 152; Schlemm, <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>,
						xxxviii. 587 ff.</note> have imagined that Stoic writers were used,
						others<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Allers, <title xml:lang="lat"
							rend="italic">De Senecae Librorum de Ira Fontibus</title>, p. 9; Pohlenz,
							<title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxxi. 321 ff.; accepted by Daebritz, <title
							rend="italic">RE</title>, i. 8. 1562. In <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>,
						xl. 292, note 1, Pohlenz attempts to refute Schlemm's arguments.</note> that
					the Peripatetic Hieronymus of Rhodes was Plutarch's principal authority. The
					numerous parallels to Seneca's <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ira</title> have been used by
					both parties to substantiate their theories, but it is more likely that
					Plutarch, while borrowing numerous <foreign xml:lang="lat">loci communes</foreign> and
					examples <pb xml:id="v.6.p.91"/> from earlier writers,<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">Books on <q type="unspecified"
							>Anger</q> were very plentiful in Cicero's day (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Epp.
							ad Quint. Frat.</title>, i. 1. 37).</note> constructed for himself the main
					features of the dialogue. The self-portrayal of Fundanus and his cure, the
					frame-work of the whole discourse, is clearly Plutarch's own device. The
					author's debt to preceding literature is, as always, immense, yet the creation
					of such a work as this is by selection and arrangement; and for that Plutarch is
					alone responsible. </p>
				<p> The essay was known to Aulus Gellius (i. 26), who relates a pleasant anecdote of
					Plutarch and a rascally slave who ventured to reprove the philosopher for his
					anger. Among English writers Jeremy Taylor has made admirable use of the essay
					by paraphrase and even translation, in his <title rend="italic">Holy Living</title>,
					iv. 8. </p>
				<p> The ms. tradition is good.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"
						>There is extant also a free Syriac translation (ed. Lagarde, <title xml:lang="lat"
							rend="italic">Analecta Syriaca</title>, Leipzig, 1858) which helps
						occasionally in the constitution of the text.</note> The work is apparently
					missing in the Lamprias catalogue, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ ὀργῆς</foreign>

						<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Patzig, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Quaest. Plut.</title>,

					which Stobaeus has preserved a fragment (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 138). </p>

					A good plan, as it seems to me, Fundanus,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified"
						anchored="true">C. Minicius Fundanus, a friend of Pliny (<title rend="italic"
							>Epp.</title>, v. 16); <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf<title rend="italic">. Pros. Imp. Rom.</title></foreign>, ii. p.
						377.</note> is that which painters follow: they scrutinize their
					productions from time to time before they finish them. They do this because, by
					withdrawing their gaze and by inspecting their work often, they are able to form
					a fresh judgement, and one which is more likely to seize upon any slight
					discrepancy, such as the familiarity of uninterrupted contemplation will
					conceal. Since, therefore, it is impossible for a man to contemplate himself
					from time to time by getting apart from himself and interrupting his
					consciousness of himself by breaking its continuity (and this is what, more than
					anything else, makes every man a poorer judge of himself than of others), the
					next best course would be for him to inspect his friends from time to time and
					likewise to offer himself to them, not to see if he is grown old suddenly or if
					his body is better or worse, but for them to examine both his behaviour and his
					character to learn whether time has added some excellence or taken away some
					vice. As for me, since I have returned to Rome after a year's absence and this
					is now the fifth month that I have been with you constantly, I do not <pb
						xml:id="v.6.p.95"/> find it altogether surprising that, of the virtues which
					were already yours by gift of Nature, there has been so great an increment and
					increase; but when I see that that violent and fiery tendency of yours toward
					anger has become so gentle and submissive to reason, it occurs to me to say with
					reference to your temper <quote rend="blockquote">O wonder, how much milder has
						it grown!<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title
								rend="italic">Il.</title>, xxii. 373.</note>
					</quote> Yet this mildness has brought about no inactivity or feebleness in you,
					but, like the earth when it has been subdued by cultivation, it has received a
					smoothness and depth conducive to fruitful action in place of that impetuousness
					of yours and quickness of temper. For that reason it is evident that the
					spirited part of your soul is not withering away through any abatement of vigour
					caused by age, nor yet spontaneously, but that it is receiving the skilful
					treatment of some excellent precepts. And yet - for I shall tell you the plain
					truth - when our friend Eros<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"
						>This friend of Plutarch is mentioned again in connexion with Fundanus in
						464 e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> told me all this, I suspected
					that he was bearing witness, by reason of his goodwill, to qualities that were
					not actually present in you, yet should be so in men of breeding, although, as
					you know, he is by no means the sort of man to surrender his own opinion as a
					favour to anyone. But as things are, Eros stands acquitted of the charge of
					bearing false witness, and do you, since our journey<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Hirzel, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der
							Dialog</title>, ii. p. 168, note 4.</note> gives us leisure for
					conversation, tell me, as though you were recounting some medical treatment,
					what remedy you used that you have made your temper so obedient to the rein and
					tender-mouthed, so mild and subservient to reason. </said></p>
				<p><said who="#Fundanus"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> Well, what about you, my generous friend Sulla? Are you careful not to
					let your <pb xml:id="v.6.p.97"/> goodwill and friendship for me make you overlook
					some of my real qualities? For since on many occasions not even Eros himself can
					keep his temper in its place in that Homeric<note resp="ed" place="unspecified"
						anchored="true">
						<title rend="italic">Od.</title>, xx. 23, cited in full 506 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat"
							>infra</foreign>.</note> obedience, but when it becomes too exasperated
					through hatred of evil, it is reasonable to suppose that I appear more gentle to
					him, just as in changes of key certain high notes assume the position of low
					notes in contrast with other high notes.</said></p>
				<p> <said who="#Sulla"><label>SULLA.</label> Neither of these suppositions is true, Fundanus. Please do as I ask. </said></p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
				<p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus"><label>FUNDANUS.</label> One of those excellent precepts of Musonius<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 36 ed. Hense.</note> which I
					remember, Sulla, is: <q type="unspecified">He that wishes to come through
						life safe and sound must continue throughout his life to be under
						treatment.</q> For I do not think that reason should be used in one's cure
					as we use hellebore, and be washed out of the body together with the disease,
					but it must remain in the soul and keep watch and ward over the judgements. For
					the power of reason is not like drugs, but like wholesome food, engendering an
					excellent state, together with great vigour, in those who become accustomed to
					it; but exhortations and admonitions, if applied to the passions when they are
					at their height and swollen, can scarcely accomplish anything at all, and that
					with difficulty. They are no better than those aromatic preparations which rouse
					epileptics when they lie prostrate, but do not rid them of the disease. Yet the
					other passions, even at their height, do in some sort yield and admit reason,
					when it comes from without to the rescue, <pb xml:id="v.6.p.99"/> into the soul; but
					temper does not, as Melanthius<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"
						>Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title>
						<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 760; quoted again in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic"
							>Moralia</title>, 551 a. The poet is not the Athenian tragic poet, but
						Melanthius of Rhodes (<foreign xml:lang="lat">circa</foreign> 150 b.c.), according to
						Wilamowitz, <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxix. 150 ff.</note> says,
						<quote rend="blockquote">Shunt off the mind, and then do dreadful
						deeds,</quote> but on the contrary, it shuts out sense completely and locks
					it out, and just like those who burn themselves up in their own homes, it makes
					everything within full of confusion and smoke and noise, so that the soul can
					neither see nor hear anything that might help it. For this reason a ship
					deserted by her crew in the midst of a storm far out at sea<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. <title rend="italic" >Moralia</title></foreign>, 1103 c.</note> will more easily be able
					to take on a pilot from the outside, than will a man who is being tossed upon
					the billows of passion and anger admit the reasoning of another, unless he has
					his own powers of reason prepared to receive it. But just as those who expect a
					siege collect and store up all that is useful to them if they despair of relief
					from without, so it is most important that we should acquire far in advance the
					reinforcements which philosophy provides against temper and convey them into the
					soul in the knowledge that, when the occasion for using them comes, it will not
					be possible to introduce them with ease. For the soul hears nothing from the
					outside because of its tumult unless it has its own reason within, which, like a
					boatswain who directs the rowers, will promptly catch and understand every order
					given. Yet if the soul has heard words of advice which have been quietly and
					mildly spoken, it despises them; and toward any who insist in a rougher fashion,
					it grows exasperated. In fact, temper is overbearing and stubborn and altogether
					difficult for anyone other than itself to move, and, like a well-fortified
					tyranny, <pb xml:id="v.6.p.101"/> must have its destroyer born and bred in the same
					household. </said></p>

			<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
				<p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label>To be sure, when anger persists and its outbursts are frequent, there is created
					in the soul an evil state which is called irascibility,<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 411
						b-c.</note> and this usually results in sudden outbursts of rage,
					moroseness, and peevishness when the temper becomes ulcerated, easily offended,
					and liable to find fault for even trivial offences, like a weak, thin piece of
					iron which is always getting scratched. But if judgement at once opposes the
					fits of anger and represses them, it not only cures them for the present, but
					for the future also it renders the soul firm and difficult for passion to
					attack. In my own case, at any rate, when I had opposed anger two or three
					times, it came about that I experienced what the Thebans did, who, when they had
					for the first time<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">At the
						battle of Leuctra, 371 b.c.</note> repulsed the Spartans, who had the
					reputation of being invincible, were never thereafter defeated by them in any
					battle; for I acquired the proud consciousness that it is possible for reason
					to conquer. Not only did I see that anger ceases when cold water is sprinkled on
					it, as Aristotle<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This is
						apparently from a lost work, though not included in Rose's collection of
						fragments. In <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Problemata</title>, x. 60 (898 a 4), however,
						Aristotle observes that fear is a process of cooling; <foreign xml:lang="lat"
							>cf.</foreign> also <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Partibus Animalium</title>, ii. 4 (651
						a 8 ff.).</note> says, but that it is also extinguished when a poultice of
					fear is applied to it. And, by Heaven, if joy comes on the scene, in the case of
					many the temper has been quickly <q type="unspecified">warmed,</q> as
						Homer<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<title rend="italic">Il.</title>, xxiii. 598, 600, <foreign xml:lang="lat">al.</foreign>;

					passion is not altogether incurable, for those, at least, who wish to cure it. </said></p>
				<p> <said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label>For anger does not always have great and powerful beginnings; on the contrary,
					even a jest, a playful <pb xml:id="v.6.p.103"/> word, a burst of laughter or a nod
					on the part of somebody, and many things of the kind, rouse many persons to
					anger; just as Helen, by thus addressing her niece, <quote rend="blockquote"

					little from some gossip or rubbishy scurrility need have no great concern about

					keeping silent and ignoring it. For he who gives no fuel to fire puts it out,
					and likewise he who does not in the beginning nurse his wrath and does not puff
					himself up with anger takes precautions against it and destroys it. I was
					therefore not satisfied with what <pb xml:id="v.6.p.105"/> Hieronymus<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">Of Rhodes, Peripatetic philosopher of the
						third century b.c.</note> says - although he contributes other useful
					remarks and advice - in the passage where he declares that we have no perception
					of anger when it comes into being, but only when it has already come into being
					and exists, the reason being the swiftness with which it acts. For the truth is
					that none of the emotions, at the time when they are gathering and beginning to
					move, has a birth and increase so easy to perceive.<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">But <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch,
							<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Amore</title>, 4 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p.

						report,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Of Patroclus's
						death, brought by Antilochus: <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, xviii. 22.</note>
					in the passage where the poet says: <quote rend="blockquote">He spoke, and a

					Achilles as being slow to lose his temper with Agamemnon<note resp="ed"
						place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<title rend="italic">Il.</title>, i. 101 ff.</note> and as becoming inflamed only
					when many words had been spoken. Yet if either one of the men had held back
					their words at the beginning and prevented their utterance, the quarrel would
					not have had so great a growth or have reached such magnitude. That is the
					reason why Socrates,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Seneca, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ira</title>, iii. 13.

				<p rend="indent"><said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label>For the first way, my friend, to dethrone temper <pb xml:id="v.6.p.107"/> as you
					would a tyrant, is not to oey or hearken when it bids us cry aloud and look
					fierce and beat our breasts, but to keep quiet and not intensify the passion, as
					we would a disease, by tossing about and making a clamour. It is quite true that
					lovers' practices, such as serenading in concert or alone and crowning the
					beloved's door with garlands, do in some way or other bring an alleviation that
					is not without charm or grace: <quote rend="blockquote">

					servants than temper. For no envy or fear or rivalry enters into our relations
					with them, but frequent fits of anger bring about many conflicts and errors, and
					because of the absolute power we possess, there being no one to oppose or
					prevent us, these cause us to slide and fall, since we are, as it were, on
					slippery ground. For it is impossible that irresponsible power under the
					influence of passion should be free from error, unless he who wields this power
					shall encompass it with a bulwark of gentleness, and shall hold out against many
					pleas of wife and friends, all charging him with laxity and easy-going ways. By
					such charges I myself used to be very greatly exasperated against my slaves, in
					the conviction that they were being ruined by not being punished. At long last,
					however, though late it was, I came to perceive that, in the first place, it is

					of reformation, and, I swear, performed their duties more zealously for the kind
					of master who gave orders silently with a nod than for the others who used blows
					and branding-irons, I began to be convinced that reason is more fit than anger
					to govern. For it is not as the Poet<note resp="ed" place="unspecified"

					gives a pause to passion and a delay which dissolves it, and also the judgement
					discovers a suitable manner of punishment and an adequate amount; furthermore,
					the man who suffers punishment has no pretext left for opposing the correction

				<p> <said who="#Fundanus" rend="merge"><label>FUNDANUS.</label>These are the reasons why we should immediately call to mind such instances and

					then and not dismiss or abandon the punishment, as we leave food when we have
					lost our appetite. And nothing is so much the cause of our punishing in a rage
					as that, when our anger is over, we do not punish, but leave things alone. We
					are very much like lazy oarsmen, who during calm weather lie in port, and later,
					at the risk of their lives, avail themselves of a wind to go sailing. And so do
					we condemn reason for remissness and softness in punishment and hasten on to the
					deed rashly and to our peril when anger, like a gale, is upon us. For while a
					hungry man indulges in food as nature dictates, yet punishment is indulged in by
					one who is not hungry or thirsty for it, nor does he need anger as a relish to
					stimulate him to punish; on the contrary, when he finds himself very far
					removed from the desire to <pb xml:id="v.6.p.137"/> punish, he brings up reason to
					reinforce him and punishes under compulsion. Aristotle<note resp="ed"
