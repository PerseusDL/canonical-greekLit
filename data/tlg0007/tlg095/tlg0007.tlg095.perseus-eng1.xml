            <head>ON THE CONTROL OF ANGER
					(DE COHIBENDA IRA)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					The subject of this essay is not the emotion of anger
					itself, but the cure best applicable to the passion.
					In form it is a dialogue, but, apart from the beginning
					and the end, it is as undramatic as the later works of
					Plato. The principal speaker, Fundanus, treats the
					subject in a manner partly general and partly specific,
					and concludes with a pleasant history of his own cure.
					Hirzel (<hi rend="italics">Der Dialog</hi>, ii. p. 170) has described the work
					as a monument (<hi rend="italics">Ehrendenkmal</hi>) to the memory of
					Fundanus, dedicated to Sulla.
				</p>
            <p>
					Scholars concerned in the investigation of the
					sources used by Plutarch for this discourse have
					arrived at varying results : some<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Wilamowitz, <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xxix. 152; Schlemm, <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xxxviii. 587 ff.</note> have imagined
					that Stoic writers were used, others<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Allers, <hi rend="italics">De Senecae Librorum de Ira Fontibus</hi>, p. 9; Pohlenz, <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xxxi. 321 ff.; accepted by Daebritz, <hi rend="italics">RE</hi>, i. 8. 1562. In <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xl. 292, note 1, Pohlenz attempts to refute Schlemm's arguments.</note> that the Peripatetic Hieronymus of Rhodes was Plutarch's principal authority. The numerous parallels to Seneca's
					<hi rend="italics">De Ira</hi> have been used by both parties to substantiate
					their theories, but it is more likely that Plutarch,
					while borrowing numerous <hi rend="italics">loci communes</hi> and examples
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.91"/>
					
					from earlier writers,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Books on <q>Anger</q> were very plentiful in Cicero's day (<hi rend="italics">Epp. ad Quint. Frat.</hi>, i. 1. 37).</note> constructed for himself the main
					features of the dialogue. The self-portrayal of
					Fundanus and his cure, the frame-work of the whole
					discourse, is clearly Plutarch's own device. The
					author's debt to preceding literature is, as always,
					immense, yet the creation of such a work as this is
					by selection and arrangement; and for that Plutarch
					is alone responsible.
				</p>
            <p>
					The essay was known to Aulus Gellius (i. 26), who
					relates a pleasant anecdote of Plutarch and a rascally
					slave who ventured to reprove the philosopher for his
					anger. Among English writers Jeremy Taylor has
					made admirable use of the essay by paraphrase and
					even translation, in his <hi rend="italics">Holy Living</hi>, iv. 8.
				</p>
            <p>
					The ms. tradition is good.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">There is extant also a free Syriac translation (ed. Lagarde, <hi rend="italics">Analecta Syriaca</hi>, Leipzig, 1858) which helps occasionally in the constitution of the text.</note> The work is apparently
					missing in the Lamprias catalogue, since <foreign xml:lang="greek">*peri\ o)rgh=s</foreign>

					(No. 93) almost certainly refers to a different work
					from which Stobaeus has preserved a fragment
					(Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 138).

					(Speakers in the Dialogue: Sulla and Fundanus)
				</p>
            <p>
					Sulla.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Sextius Sulla, a friend of Plutarch (<hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 636 a, and <hi rend="italics">Prosopographia Imperii Romani</hi>, iii. p. 239).</note> A good plan, as it seems to me, Fundanus,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">C. Minicius Fundanus, a friend of Pliny (<hi rend="italics">Epp.</hi>, v. 16); <hi rend="italics">cf. Pros. Imp. Rom.</hi>, ii. p. 377.</note> is that which painters follow : they scrutinize
					their productions from time to time before they
					finish them. They do this because, by withdrawing
					their gaze and by inspecting their work often, they
					are able to form a fresh judgement, and one which is
					more likely to seize upon any slight discrepancy,
					such as the familiarity of uninterrupted contemplation will conceal. Since, therefore, it is impossible
					for a man to contemplate himself from time to time
					by getting apart from himself and interrupting his
					consciousness of himself by breaking its continuity
					(and this is what, more than anything else, makes
					every man a poorer judge of himself than of others),
					the next best course would be for him to inspect
					his friends from time to time and likewise to offer
					himself to them, not to see if he is grown old suddenly
					or if his body is better or worse, but for them to
					examine both his behaviour and his character to learn
					whether time has added some excellence or taken
					away some vice. As for me, since I have returned to
					Rome after a year's absence and this is now the fifth
					month that I have been with you constantly, I do not
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.95"/>
					
					find it altogether surprising that, of the virtues which
					were already yours by gift of Nature, there has been
					so great an increment and increase ; but when I see
					that that violent and fiery tendency of yours toward
					anger has become so gentle and submissive to reason,
					it occurs to me to say with reference to your temper
					<quote rend="blockquote">O wonder, how much milder has it grown!<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Homer, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi>, xxii. 373.</note>
               </quote> 
					Yet this mildness has brought about no inactivity or
					feebleness in you, but, like the earth when it has been
					subdued by cultivation, it has received a smoothness
					and depth conducive to fruitful action in place of that
					impetuousness of yours and quickness of temper.
					For that reason it is evident that the spirited part of
					your soul is not withering away through any abatement of vigour caused by age, nor yet spontaneously,
					but that it is receiving the skilful treatment of some
					excellent precepts. And yet - for I shall tell you the
					plain truth - when our friend Eros<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This friend of Plutarch is mentioned again in connexion with Fundanus in 464 e, <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> told me all this,
					I suspected that he was bearing witness, by reason
					of his goodwill, to qualities that were not actually
					present in you, yet should be so in men of breeding, although, as you know, he is by no means
					the sort of man to surrender his own opinion as a
					favour to anyone. But as things are, Eros stands
					acquitted of the charge of bearing false witness, and
					do you, since our journey<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See Hirzel, <hi rend="italics">Der Dialog</hi>, ii. p. 168, note 4.</note> gives us leisure for conversation, tell me, as though you were recounting
					some medical treatment, what remedy you used that
					you have made your temper so obedient to the rein
					and tender-mouthed, so mild and subservient to
					reason.
				</p>
            <p>
					Fundanus. Well, what about you, my generous
					friend Sulla? Are you careful not to let your
					
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.97"/>
					
					goodwill and friendship for me make you overlook
					some of my real qualities? For since on many
					occasions not even Eros himself can keep his temper
					in its place in that Homeric<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi>, xx. 23, cited in full 506 b, <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> obedience, but when it
					becomes too exasperated through hatred of evil, it
					is reasonable to suppose that I appear more gentle
					to him, just as in changes of key certain high notes
					assume the position of low notes in contrast with other
					high notes.</p>
            <p>
					Sulla. Neither of these suppositions is true,
					Fundanus. Please do as I ask.
				</p>
         </div>
         <div type="textpart" n="2" subtype="section">
            <p>Fundanus. One of those excellent precepts
					of Musonius<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Frag. 36 ed. Hense.</note> which I remember, Sulla, is : <q>He
						that wishes to come through life safe and sound
						must continue throughout his life to be under treatment.</q> For I do not think that reason should
					be used in one's cure as we use hellebore, and be
					washed out of the body together with the disease,
					but it must remain in the soul and keep watch
					and ward over the judgements. For the power
					of reason is not like drugs, but like wholesome
					food, engendering an excellent state, together with
					great vigour, in those who become accustomed to
					it; but exhortations and admonitions, if applied
					to the passions when they are at their height and
					swollen, can scarcely accomplish anything at all,
					and that with difficulty. They are no better than
					those aromatic preparations which rouse epileptics
					when they lie prostrate, but do not rid them
					of the disease. Yet the other passions, even at
					their height, do in some sort yield and admit
					reason, when it comes from without to the rescue,
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.99"/>
					
					into the soul; but temper does not, as Melanthius<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Graec. Frag.</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, p. 760; quoted again in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 551 a. The poet is not the Athenian tragic poet, but Melanthius of Rhodes (<hi rend="italics">circa</hi> 150 b.c.), according to Wilamowitz, <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xxix. 150 ff.</note>
					says,
					<quote rend="blockquote">Shunt off the mind, and then do dreadful deeds,</quote>
					but on the contrary, it shuts out sense completely and
					locks it out, and just like those who burn themselves up in their own homes, it makes everything
					within full of confusion and smoke and noise, so that
					the soul can neither see nor hear anything that might
					help it. For this reason a ship deserted by her crew
					in the midst of a storm far out at sea<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 1103 c.</note> will more
					easily be able to take on a pilot from the outside, than
					will a man who is being tossed upon the billows of
					passion and anger admit the reasoning of another,
					unless he has his own powers of reason prepared to
					receive it. But just as those who expect a siege
					collect and store up all that is useful to them if they
					despair of relief from without, so it is most important
					that we should acquire far in advance the reinforcements which philosophy provides against temper and
					convey them into the soul in the knowledge that,
					when the occasion for using them comes, it will not
					be possible to introduce them with ease. For the
					soul hears nothing from the outside because of its
					tumult unless it has its own reason within, which, like
					a boatswain who directs the rowers, will promptly
					catch and understand every order given. Yet if
					the soul has heard words of advice which have been
					quietly and mildly spoken, it despises them; and
					toward any who insist in a rougher fashion, it grows
					exasperated. In fact, temper is overbearing and
					stubborn and altogether difficult for anyone other
					than itself to move, and, like a well-fortified tyranny,
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.101"/>
					
					must have its destroyer born and bred in the same
					household.
				</p>
         </div>
         <div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="section">
            <p>To be sure, when anger persists and its outbursts
					are frequent, there is created in the soul an evil state
					which is called irascibility,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend="italics">Republic</hi>, 411 b-c.</note> and this usually results in
					sudden outbursts of rage, moroseness, and peevishness when the temper becomes ulcerated, easily
					offended, and liable to find fault for even trivial
					offences, like a weak, thin piece of iron which is always
					getting scratched. But if judgement at once opposes
					the fits of anger and represses them, it not only cures
					them for the present, but for the future also it renders
					the soul firm and difficult for passion to attack. In
					my own case, at any rate, when I had opposed anger
					two or three times, it came about that I experienced
					what the Thebans did, who, when they had for the
					first time<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">At the battle of Leuctra, 371 b.c.</note> repulsed the Spartans, who had the reputation of being invincible, were never thereafter defeated by them in any battle ; for I acquired the
					proud consciousness that it is possible for reason to
					conquer. Not only did I see that anger ceases when
					cold water is sprinkled on it, as Aristotle<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This is apparently from a lost work, though not included in Rose's collection of fragments. In <hi rend="italics">Problemata</hi>, x. 60 (898 a 4), however, Aristotle observes that fear is a process of cooling; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italics">De Partibus Animalium</hi>, ii. 4 (651 a 8 ff.).</note> says, but
					that it is also extinguished when a poultice of fear is
					applied to it. And, by Heaven, if joy comes on the
					scene, in the case of many the temper has been
					quickly <q>warmed,</q> as Homer<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi>, xxiii. 598, 600, <hi rend="italics">al.</hi>; for Plutarch's interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)ai/nesqai</foreign> see <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 947 d: <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)le/an tw=| sw/mati meq' h(donh=s, o(/per *(/omhros i)ai/nesqai ke/klhken</foreign>; see also <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 735 f.</note> says, or dissipated.
					Consequently I came to the opinion that this passion
					is not altogether incurable, for those, at least, who
					wish to cure it.

					For anger does not always have great and powerful

					word, a burst of laughter or a nod on the part of
					somebody, and many things of the kind, rouse many
					persons to anger ; just as Helen, by thus addressing
					her niece,

					provoked her to reply,
					<quote rend="blockquote">

					Hieronymus<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Of Rhodes, Peripatetic philosopher of the third century b.c.</note> says - although he contributes other

					declares that we have no perception of anger when it
					comes into being, but only when it has already come
					into being and exists, the reason being the swiftness
					with which it acts. For the truth is that none of the
					emotions, at the time when they are gathering and
					beginning to move, has a birth and increase so easy
					to perceive.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">But <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">De Amore</hi>, 4 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 134).</note> Indeed Homer also skilfully teaches

					Samian, when he was to plead, stopped up his ears
					with wax, that he might not spoil his case through
					temper at the insults of his enemies. And as for
					ourselves, does it not happen often that the punishment of a delinquent slave eludes our power? For
					slaves are made afraid by threatening words and run
					away.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Seneca, <hi rend="italics">De Ira</hi>, iii. 5. 4.</note> The words, therefore, which nurses use with

					For if a father sees his son trying to cut something

            <p>But however true it is that all the passions have

					that we can better learn to control by practising on
					servants than temper. For no envy or fear or rivalry
					enters into our relations with them, but frequent
					fits of anger bring about many conflicts and errors,
					and because of the absolute power we possess, there
					being no one to oppose or prevent us, these cause us
					to slide and fall, since we are, as it were, on slippery
					ground. For it is impossible that irresponsible power
					under the influence of passion should be free from
					error, unless he who wields this power shall encompass it with a bulwark of gentleness, and shall hold
					out against many pleas of wife and friends, all
					charging him with laxity and easy-going ways. By
					such charges I myself used to be very greatly exasperated against my slaves, in the conviction that
					they were being ruined by not being punished. At
					long last, however, though late it was, I came to
					perceive that, in the first place, it is better to make
					them worse by forbearance than by harshness and
					anger to pervert my own self for the correction of
					the others. In the second place, when I observed
					that many, just because they were not being punished, were often ashamed to be bad, and made
					pardon, rather than correction, the starting-point
					of reformation, and, I swear, performed their duties
					more zealously for the kind of master who gave
					orders silently with a nod than for the others who
					used blows and branding-irons, I began to be convinced that reason is more fit than anger to govern.
					For it is not as the Poet<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Homer), <hi rend="italics">Cypria</hi>, Frag. 20 ed. Kinkel; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Life of Cleomenes</hi>, ix. (xxx.) (808 e); Plato, <hi rend="italics">Euthyphro</hi>, 12 a-b.</note> has said,

					<pb n="v.6.p.133"/>
					
					engendered the kind of fear that corrects behaviour,
					whereas continual and unmerciful beating produces,
					not repentance for wrongdoing, but rather the farsighted cunning to do wrong without detection. In
					the third place, I always keep in mind and reflect in
					privacy that he who taught us the use of the bow did
					not forbid us to shoot, but only to miss the mark,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 451 e, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note> and
					that the infliction of punishment will not be hindered
					by our teaching how to inflict it at the right time,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">When it is really deserved.</note> with
					moderation, and in a useful and suitable manner ;
					and, remembering these things, I try to get rid of my
					anger, if possible, by not depriving those who are to
					be punished of the right to speak in their defence, but
					by listening to their plea. For both the passage of
					time gives a pause to passion and a delay which dissolves it, and also the judgement discovers a suitable
					manner of punishment and an adequate amount ;
					furthermore, the man who suffers punishment has no
					pretext left for opposing the correction if punishment
					is inflicted, not in anger, but after the accused has
					been proved guilty ; and finally, the most shameful
					thing is avoided-that the slave should seem to be
					making a juster plea than his master.
				</p>
            <p>
					And so, just as Phocion<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Life of Phocion</hi>, xxii. (751 e); <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 188 d.</note> after Alexander's death,
					trying to keep the Athenians from revolting prematurely or believing the report too quickly, said to
					them, <q>If, men of Athens, he is dead to-day, he will
						be dead to-morrow also, and the day after</q> ; in like
					manner, I think, the man who, urged on by anger, is
					in a hurry for vengeance, should suggest to himself,
					<q>If this person is guilty of wronging you to-day, he
						will still be guilty to-morrow also, and the day after ;
						
						<pb n="v.6.p.135"/>
						
						no harm will be done if he shall be punished somewhat
						late, but if he is punished in haste he will always be
						thought to have suffered without offending ; and this
						has happened many times in the past.</q> For which of
					us is so harsh that he scourges and chastises a slave
					because five or ten days ago he overroasted the meat
					or upset the table or carne too slowly at our bidding?
					And yet these are the very things which cause us to
					be excited and in a cruel and implacable mood at
					the moment they happen and are still fresh in our
					memory. For as the shapes of persons seen through
					a fog, so things seen through a mist of rage appear
					greater than they are.
				</p>
            <p>
					These are the reasons why we should immediately
					call to mind such instances and precepts ; and when
					we are free from all suspicion of passion, if the
					offence still appears evil to the clear and settled
					judgement, we should attend to it then and not
					dismiss or abandon the punishment, as we leave food
					when we have lost our appetite. And nothing
					is so much the cause of our punishing in a rage as
					that, when our anger is over, we do not punish, but
					leave things alone. We are very much like lazy
					oarsmen, who during calm weather lie in port, and
					later, at the risk of their lives, avail themselves of
					a wind to go sailing. And so do we condemn reason
					for remissness and softness in punishment and
					hasten on to the deed rashly and to our peril when
					anger, like a gale, is upon us. For while a hungry
					man indulges in food as nature dictates, yet
					punishment is indulged in by one who is not hungry
					or thirsty for it, nor does he need anger as a relish
					to stimulate him to punish ; on the contrary, when he
					finds himself very far removed from the desire to
					
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.137"/>
					
					punish, he brings up reason to reinforce him and
					punishes under compulsion. Aristotle<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Frag. 608 ed. Rose.</note> relates that
					in Etruria in his day slaves were scourged to the
					music of pipes. But one should not, in that spirit,
					through a craving for the punishment as for a kind of
					enjoyment, gorge oneself with it, and rejoice while
					inflicting chastisement and after inflicting it repent<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 550 e, where the whole context may be compared with this chapter. See also Seneca, <hi rend="italics">De Ira</hi>, i. 17-18.</note>
					- of these the first is bestial, the second womanish -
					but without either sorrow or pleasure one should mete
					out punishment in reason's own good time, leaving
					anger no excuse.

					severely. Therefore anyone who is prone to anger
					should abstain from rare and curiously wrought things,
					like drinking-cups and seal-rings and precious stones ;
					for their loss drives their owner out of his senses more

					that judgement: this placid and gentle and humane
					spirit is not so agreeable and pleasant and free from
					sorrow to any of those brought in contact with it as
					it is to those who themselves possess it.
