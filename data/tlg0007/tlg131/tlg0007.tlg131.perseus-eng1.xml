            <head>ON THE EATING OF FLESH (DE ESU CARNIUM) I <lb/> INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					These two badly mutilated discourses, urging the
					necessity for vegetarianism, are merely extracts
					from a series (see 996 a) which Plutarch delivered in
					his youth, perhaps to a Boeotian audience (995 e).<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This was Hirzel's opinion (<hi rend="italics">Der Dialog</hi>, ii, p. 126, n. 2), which Ziegler (<hi rend="italics">RE, s.v.</hi> 
                  <q>Plutarchos,</q> col. 734) combats.</note>
					In spite of the exaggerated and calculated rhetoric<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">F. Krauss, <hi rend="italics">Die rhetorischen Schriften Plutarchs</hi>, pp. 77 ff.</note>
					these fragments probably depict faithfully a foible
					of Plutarch's early manhood, the Pythagorean or
					Orphic<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Laws</hi>, 782 c. Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Mor.</hi> 159 c, makes Solon say, <q>To refrain entirely from eating meat, as they record of Orpheus long ago, is rather a quibble than a way of avoiding wrong diet.</q>
               </note> abstention from animal food. There is
					little trace of this in his later life as known to us,
					though a corrupt passage in the <hi rend="italics">Symposiacs</hi> (635 e)
					seems to say that because of a dream our author
					abstained from eggs for a long time. In the <hi rend="italics">De
					Sanitate Tuenda</hi> also (132 a) Plutarch excuses flesh-eating on the ground that habit <q>has become a sort
						of unnatural second nature.</q>
				        </p>
            <p>
					The work appears, on the whole, rather immature
					beside the <hi rend="italics">Gryllus</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">De Sollertia Animalium</hi>,
					but the text is so poor that this may not be the
					author's fault. In fact the excerptor responsible for
					our jumbled text, introducing both stupid interpolations (see especially 998 a) and even an extract from
					an entirely different work (994 b-d), may well have
					
					<pb n="v.12.p.538"/>
					
					altered Plutarch's wording in many other places
					where we have not the means to detect him.
				</p>
            <p>
					Porphyry<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">It is, of course, possible that Porphyry used some portion of the missing parts of our work; but this cannot be proved and may even be thought unlikely in view of the fact that he makes no use of any extant portion.</note> (<hi rend="italics">De Abstinentia</hi>, iii. 24) says that Plutarch attacked the Stoics and Peripatetics in many
					books; in this one the anti-Stoic polemic has only
					just begun (999 a) when the work breaks off. For a
					more complete assault the reader must turn back to
					the two preceding dialogues.
				</p>
            <p>
					It is interesting to learn that Shelley found these
					fragments inspiring. In the eighth book of <hi rend="italics">Queen
					Mab</hi> (verses 211 ff.) we read :
					<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>No longer now
					</l>
                  <l>He slays the lamb that looks him in the face,
					</l>
                  <l>And horribly devours his mangled flesh,
					</l>
                  <l>Which, still avenging Nature's broken law,
					</l>
                  <l>Kindled all putrid humours in his frame,
					</l>
                  <l>All evil passions, and all vain belief, ...
					</l>
                  <l>The germs of misery, death, disease, and crime.</l>
               </quote>
					To this passage the poet appended, <hi rend="italics">more suo</hi>, a long
					note which ended with four quotations from our essay
					in Greek, untranslated (a compliment to the public
					of his day, one may suppose). This note he subsequently republished as <hi rend="italics">A Vindication of Natural Diet</hi>
					(1813), omitting the Greek ; and in the same year he
					wrote to Thomas Hogg that he had <q>translated the
						two Essays of Plutarch, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*peri\ sarkofagi/as</foreign>.</q> But this
					has been lost; it has not, at least, been found among
					the unpublished Shelley material in the Bodleian.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">These facts I owe to the kindness of Professors J. A. Notopoulos of Trinity College and J. E. Jordan of the University of California; see also K. N. Cameron, <hi rend="italics">The Young Shelley</hi>, pp. 224 f.</note>

					This is one of the eighteen works of the received
					Corpus of Plutarch that do not appear in the Lamprias
					Catalogue. Such a fact is not, however, to be adduced against its genuineness, since the <hi rend="italics">Symposiacs</hi>
					themselves are not to be found there.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">It is important to observe that H. Fuchs, <hi rend="italics">Der geistige Widerstand gegen Rom</hi>, p. 49, n. 60, athetizes this work. A further discussion by this great critic would be warmly welcomed, especially since Wilamowitz recognized here also <q>den unverkennbaren Stempel der plutarchischen Art.</q>

					dead, if you have qualms about enjoying the flesh
					while life is still present, why do you continue,
					contrary to nature, to eat what possesses life ? Even
					when it is lifeless and dead, however, no one eats the
					flesh just as it is ; men boil it and roast it, altering
					it by fire and drugs, recasting and diverting and
					smothering with countless condiments the taste of
					gore so that the palate may be deceived and accept

					as though we were really embalming a corpse for

					had flayed a ram while it was still alive ; yet, as
					I think, he who tortures a living creature is no worse
					than he who slaughters it outright. But it seems
					that we are more observant of acts contrary to convention than of those that are contrary to nature. In
					that place, then, I made my remarks in a popular
					vein. I still hesitate, however, to attempt a discussion of the principle underlying my opinion, great as
					it is, and mysterious and incredible, as Plato<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Phaedrus</hi>, 245 c.</note> says,

					By these lines he means, though he does not say so

					bodies as a punishment for murder, the eating of
					animal flesh, and cannibalism. This doctrine, however, seems to be even older, for the stories told about
					the sufferings and dismemberment of Dionysus<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See I. M.
