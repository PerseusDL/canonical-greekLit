<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head><p rend="indent"> The Letter of Condolence to Apollonius, into which quotations from earlier authors have been emptied from the sack rather than scattered by hand, has in comparatively recent years fallen under suspicion as being perhaps not the work of Plutarch. The suspicion rests mainly on two grounds, the unusual length of the quotations, and certain incongruities of style. The latter may here be briefly dismissed with the remark that for every departure from accepted Plutarchean style a striking instance of conformity to his style may be cited, so that no very positive results are to be obtained in this way. The case is much the same with the quotations. Many of them are unusually long, although not longer than we find in other authors. Some of them, for example Euripides, Suppliants 1110 and 1112 (Plut. 110c), show an accuracy of ms. tradition so far superior that the reading given by Plutarch is commonly adopted by editors of Euripides in preference to the traditional reading of the mss. of Euripides. On the other hand, the quotation from Plato, Gorgias 523 a (Plut. 120 e), shows many minor variations from our text of Plato; some of these are interesting in themselves, but none of them really disturbs the meaning of the passage. </p><p rend="indent">We learn from the letter almost nothing about <pb xml:id="v.2.p.106"/> Apollonius and his departed son, and hardly more about Plutarch. It lacks the intimate touch of a similar letter which was written by Plutarch to his wife (Moralia, 608 a). Indeed we cannot be wholly sure that the boy was called Apollonius after his father, for one stroke of the pen to change the accusative to a vocative (121 e) would cause his name to disappear entirely. </p><p rend="indent">The title of the letter is not found in Lamprias’ list of Plutarch’s works, nevertheless we have reference to it at a comparatively early date. </p><p rend="indent">Some striking similarities between the letter and Cicero’s Tusculan Disputations are doubtless to be explained by derivation from a common source, and this source was doubtless in large part the works of the Academic philosopher Crantor. </p><p rend="indent">In the absence of actual knowledge it is convenient to assume an hypothesis (as in the realm of science one speaks of <q>atoms</q> or <q> ions</q> or of the electric <q type="unspecified" >current</q>). If we assume that this is the original rough draft of the letter which was to be sent to Apollonius, nearly everything can be made to square with the hypothesis. In selecting some of the quotations Plutarch had put down enough of the context, so that later the lines he might finally choose to insert could be smoothly interwoven with the text, and the text itself was no doubt to be subjected to further polish. </p><p rend="indent">However, we may be profoundly grateful for the collection of extracts included in the letter, and, if the hypothesis be right, we may also be grateful for this glimpse of Plutarch’s methods of composition. </p><p rend="indent">We must bear in mind that this particular form of literary composition had developed a style of its <pb xml:id="v.2.p.107"/> own, the earliest example perhaps being the Axiochus (of Plato ?), and we have records of many more now lost. Among the Romans also this form of composition was popular, and several examples may be found in the works of Seneca. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.2.p.109"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Even before this time, Apollonius, I felt for you in your sorrow and trouble, when I heard of the untimely passing from life of your son, who was very dear to us all—a youth who was altogether decorous and modest, and unusually observant of the demands of religion and justice both toward the gods and toward his parents and friends. In those days, close upon the time of his death, to visit you and urge you to bear your present lot as a mortal man should would have been unsuitable, when you were prostrated in both body and soul by the unexpected calamity; and, besides, I could not help sharing in your feeling. For even the best of physicians do not at once apply the remedy of medicines against acute attacks of suppurating humours, but allow the painfulness of the inflammation, without the application of external medicaments, to attain some assuagement of itself.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Cicero, <title rend="italic" >Tusculan Disputations</title>, 29 (63), and Pliny, <title rend="italic">Letters</title>, v. 16.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">Now since time, which is wont to assuage all things, has intervened since the calamity, and your present condition seems to demand the aid of your friends, I have conceived it to be proper to communicate to you some words that can give comfort, for <pb xml:id="v.2.p.111"/> the mitigation of grief and the termination of mournful and vain lamentations. For <quote rend="blockquote">Words are physicians for an ailing mind, When at the fitting time one soothes the heart.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Aeschylus, <title rend="italic">Prometheus Bound</title>, 379.</note> </quote> Since, according to the wise Euripides,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Trag.

They say: <quote rend="blockquote">To many there doth come because of grief Insanity and ills incurable, And some for grief have ended their own life.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From Philemon; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Kock, <title xml:lang="lat">Com. Att. Frag.</title> ii. p. 512, Philemon, No. 106, where additional lines are given.</note> </quote> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">The pain and pang felt at the death of a son has in itself good cause to awaken grief, which is only natural, and over it we have no control. For I, for my part, cannot concur with those who extol that harsh and callous indifference, which is both impossible and unprofitable.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Cicero, <title rend="italic" >Tusculan Disputations</title>, iii. 6 (12).</note> For this will rob us of the kindly feeling which comes from mutual affection and which above all else we must conserve. But to be carried beyond all bounds and to help in exaggerating our griefs I say is contrary to nature, and results from our depraved ideas. Therefore this also must be dismissed as injurious and depraved and most unbecoming to right-minded men, but a moderate indulgence <pb xml:id="v.2.p.113"/> in grief is not to be disapproved. <q>Pray that we be not ill,</q> says Crantor <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Mullach, <title xml:lang="lat" >Frag. Philos. Graec.</title> iii. p. 146; Cicero, <title rend="italic">Tusculan Disputations</title>, iii. 6 (12).</note> of the Academy, <q>but if we be ill, pray that sensation be left us, whether one of our members be cut off or torn out.</q> For this insensibility to pain <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Such Stoicism was required by the stricter Stoic school, but the philosophers of the Academy would have none of it.</note> is attained by man only at a great price; for in the former case, we may suppose, it is the body which has been brutalized into such insensibility, but in the latter case the soul. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Reason therefore requires that men of understanding should be neither indifferent in such calamities nor extravagantly affected; for the one course is unfeeling and brutal, the other lax and effeminate. Sensible is he who keeps within appropriate bounds and is able to bear judiciously both the agreeable and the grievous in his lot, and who has made up his mind beforehand to conform uncomplainingly and obediently to the dispensation of things; just as in a democracy there is an allotment of offices, and he who draws the lot holds office, while he who fails to do so must bear his fortune without taking offence. For those who cannot do this would be unable sensibly and soberly to abide good fortune either. </p><p rend="indent">Among the felicitous utterances the following piece of advice is to the point: <quote rend="blockquote">Let no success be so unusual That it excite in you too great a pride, Nor abject be in turn, if ill betide; But ever be the same; preserve unchanged Your nature, like to gold when tried by fire.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From an unknown play of Euripides; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title>, Euripides, No. 963.</note> </quote> It is the mark of educated and disciplined men to <pb xml:id="v.2.p.115"/> keep the same habit of mind toward seeming prosperity, and nobly to maintain a becoming attitude toward adversity. For it is the task of rational prudence, either to be on guard against evil as it approaches, or, if it have already happened, to rectify it or to minimize it or to provide oneself with a virile and noble patience to endure it. For wisdom deals also with the good, in a fourfold way— either acquiring a store of goods, or conserving them, or adding to them, or using them judiciously. These are the laws of wisdom and of the other virtues, and they must be followed for better fortune or for worse. For <quote rend="blockquote">No man exists who’s blest in everything,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From the <title>Stheneboea</title> of Euripides, <foreign xml:lang="lat">ibid.</foreign> No. 661.</note> </quote> and truly <quote rend="blockquote">What thou must do cannot be made <q>must not.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Author unknown; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat">Trag.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">For as there are in plants at one time seasons of fruitage and at another time seasons of unfruitfulness, and in animals at one time fecundity and at another time barrenness, and on the sea both fair weather and storm, so also in life many diverse circumstances occur which bring about a reversal of human fortunes. As one contemplates these reversals he might say not inappropriately: <quote rend="blockquote">Not for good and no ill came thy life from thy sire, Agamemnon, but joy Thou shalt find interwoven with grief; For a mortal thou art. Though against thy desire Yet the plans of the gods will so have it.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Euripides, <title rend="italic">Iphigenia at Aulis</title>, 29; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 33 E.</note> </quote> and the words of Menander <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Kock, <title xml:lang="lat">Com. Att. Frag.</title> iii. p. 155, No. 531, and Allinson, <title rend="italic">Menander</title> (in L.C.L.), p. 478.</note>: <pb xml:id="v.2.p.117"/> <quote rend="blockquote">If you alone, young master, at your birth Had gained the right to do whate’er you would Throughout your life, and ever be in luck, And if some god agreed to this with you, Then you have right to feel aggrieved. He has Deceived and strangely treated you. But if Upon the selfsame terms as we, you drew The primal breath of universal life (To speak you somewhat in the tragic style), You must endure this better, and use sense. To sum up all I say, you are a man, Than which no thing that lives can swifter be Exalted high and straight brought low again. And rightly so; for though of puny frame, He yet doth handle many vast affairs, And, falling, ruins great prosperity. But you, young master, have not forfeited Surpassing good, and these your present ills But moderate are; so bear without excess What Fortune may hereafter bring to you.</quote> But, in spite of this condition of affairs, some persons, through their foolishness, are so silly and conceited, that, when only a little exalted, either because of abundance of money, or importance of office, or petty political preferments, or because of position and repute, they threaten and insult those in lower station, not bearing in mind the uncertainty and inconstancy of fortune, nor yet the fact that the lofty is easily brought low and the humble in turn is exalted, transposed by the swift-moving changes of fortune. Therefore to try to find any constancy in what is inconstant is a trait of people who do not rightly reason about the circumstances of life. For <pb xml:id="v.2.p.119"/> <quote rend="blockquote">The wheel goes round, and of the rim now one And now another part is at the top.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Author unknown; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Bergk, <title xml:lang="lat">Poet.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">Reason is the best remedy for the cure of grief, reason and the preparedness through reason for all the changes of life. For one ought to realize, not merely that he himself is mortal by nature, but also that he is allotted to a life that is mortal and to conditions which readily reverse themselves.

Nobody? Which is which ? A dream of a shadow is man. Very vividly and skilfully did he use this extravagance of expression in making clear the life of mankind. For what is feebler than a shadow ? And a dream of it!—that is something which defies any clear description. In similar strain Crantor, <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Mullach, <title xml:lang="lat" >Frag. Philos. Graec.</title> iii. p. 147.</note> endeavouring to comfort Hippocles upon the death of his children, says: <q>All our ancient philosophy states this and urges it upon us; and though there be therein other things which we do not accept, yet at any rate the statement that life is oftentimes toilsome and hard is only too true. For even if it is not so by nature, yet through our own selves it has reached this state of corruption. From a distant time, yes from the beginning, this uncertain fortune has attended us and to no good end, and even at our birth there is conjoined with us a portion of evil in everything. For the very seed of our life, since it is mortal, participates in this causation, and from this there steal upon us defectiveness of soul, diseases of body, loss of friends by death, and the common portion of mortals.</q> For what reason have we turned our thoughts in this direction? It is that we may know that misfortune is nothing novel for man, but that we all have <pb xml:id="v.2.p.123"/> had the same experience of it. For Theophrastus <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 73 (ed. Wimmer).</note> says: <q>Fortune is heedless, and she has a wonderful power to take away the fruits of our labours and to overturn our seeming tranquillity, and for doing this she has no fixed season.</q> These matters, and others like them, it is easy for each man to reason out for himself, and to learn them from wise men of old besides; of whom the first is the divine Homer, who said <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> xviii. 130.</note>: <quote rend="blockquote">Nothing more wretched than man doth the earth support on its bosom, Never, he says to himself, shall he suffer from evil hereafter, Never, so long as the gods give him strength and his knees are still nimble; Then when the blessed gods bring upon him grievous affliction, Still he endures his misfortune, reluctant but steadfast in spirit.</quote> And: <quote rend="blockquote">Such is the mood of the men who here on the earth are abiding, E’en as the day which the father of men and of gods brings upon them.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> xviii. 136.</note> </quote> And in another place: <quote rend="blockquote">Great-hearted son of Tydeus, why do you ask of my fathers ? As is the race of the leaves, such too is that of all mortals.

Him upon whom he bestows what is baneful he makes wholly wretched; Ravenous hunger drives him o’er the earth’s goodly bosom, Hither and thither he goes, unhonoured of gods or of mortals.</quote> Hesiod, who, although he proclaimed himself the disciple of the Muses, is nevertheless second to Homer in reputation as well as in time, also confines the evils in a great urn and represents Pandora as opening it and scattering the host of them over the whole land and sea. His words <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 94; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also <title xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 115 A and 127 D.</note> are as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">Then with her hands did the woman, uplifting the urn’s massive cover, Let them go as they would; and on men she brought woeful afflictions. <pb xml:id="v.2.p.129"/> Hope alone where it was, with its place of abode yet undamaged, Under the rim of the urn still tarried; nor into the open Winged its way forth; for before it escaped she had put on the cover. More are the woes unnumbered among men now freely ranging. Full is the land now of evils, and full of them too is the ocean; Illnesses come upon men in the daytime, and others at nighttime; Hither and thither they go, of themselves bringing evils to mortals; Silent they go, since the wisdom of Zeus has deprived them of voices.</quote> </p> </div>

But as it is, events that come to pass, My master, do not mind nor heed these things, But, whether you shed tears or not, pursue The even tenor of their way. What then Do we accomplish by our weeping ? Naught. But as the trees have fruit, grief has these tears. And Dictys, who is trying to console Danaë in her excessive grief, says: <quote rend="blockquote">Think you that Hades minds your moans at all, And will send back your child if you will groan ?

For after the death of his wife, Lyde, whom he loved very dearly, he composed, as a consolation for his grief, the elegy called Lyde, in which he enumerated the misfortunes of the heroes, and thus made his own grief less by means of others’ ills. So it is clear that he who tries to console a person in grief, and demonstrates that the calamity is one which is common to many, and less than the calamities which have befallen others, changes the opinion of the one in grief and gives him a similar conviction— that his calamity is really less than he supposed it to be. </p> </div>

The same agency which at the first showed us the light of the sun brings also the darkness of Hades. May not the air surrounding us serve to symbolize this, causing as it does day and night alternately, which bring us life and death, and sleep and waking ? Wherefore it is said that life is a debt to destiny, the idea being that the loan which our forefathers contracted is to be repaid by us.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">Socrates <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title>Apology</title>, p. 40 C.</note> said that death resembles either a very deep sleep or a long and distant journey, or, thirdly, a sort of destruction and extinction of both the body and the soul, but that by no one of these possibilities is it an evil. Each of these conceptions he pursued further, and the first one first. For if <pb xml:id="v.2.p.139"/> death is a sleep, and there is nothing evil in the state of those who sleep, it is evident that there is likewise nothing evil in the state of those who are dead. Nay, what need is there even to state that the deepest sleep is indeed the sweetest ? For the fact is of itself patent to all men, and Homer <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> xiii. 80.</note> bears witness by saying regarding it: <quote rend="blockquote">Slumber the deepest and sweetest, and nearest to death in its semblance.</quote> In another place <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Il.</title> xiv. 231.</note> also he says: <quote rend="blockquote">Here she chanced to encounter the brother of Death, which is Slumber,</quote> and <quote rend="blockquote">Slumber and Death, the twin brothers,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Il.</title> xvi. 672, 682.</note> </quote> thereby indicating their similarity in appearance, for twins show most similarity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">If death indeed resembles a journey, even so <pb xml:id="v.2.p.141"/> it is not an evil. On the contrary, it may even be a good. For to pass one’s time unenslaved by the flesh and its emotions, by which the mind is distracted and tainted with human folly, would be a blessed piece of good fortune. <q>For the body,</q> says Plato, <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Phaedo</title>, p. 66 B.</note> <q>in countless ways leaves us no leisure because of its necessary care and feeding. Moreover, if any diseases invade it, they hinder our pursuit of reality, and it fills us with lusts and desires and fears and all manner of fancies and folly, so that, as the saying goes, because of it we really have no opportunity to think seriously of anything. It is a fact that wars and strifes and battles are brought about by nothing else except the body and its desires; for all wars are waged for the acquisition of property, and property we are forced to acquire because of the body, since we are slaves in its service; and the result is that, because of these things, we have no leisure for study. And the worst of all is, that even if we do gain some leisure from the demands of the body, and turn to the consideration of some subject, yet at every point in our investigation the body forces itself in, and causes tumult and confusion, and disconcerts us, so that on account of it we are unable to discern the truth. Nay, the fact has been thoroughly demonstrated to us that, if we are ever going to have any pure knowledge, we must divest ourselves of the body, and with the soul itself observe the realities. And, as it appears, we shall possess what we desire and what we profess to long for—and that is wisdom—only, as our reasoning shows, after we are dead, but not <pb xml:id="v.2.p.143"/> while we are alive. For if it is impossible in company with the body to have any pure knowledge, then one of two things is true: either it is not possible to attain knowledge anywhere, or else only after death. For then the soul will be quite by itself, separate from the body, but before that time never. And so, while we live, we shall, as it appears, be nearest to knowledge if, as far as possible, we have no association or communion with the body, except such as absolute necessity requires, and if we do not taint ourselves with its nature, but keep ourselves pure of it until such time as God himself shall release us. And thus, being rid of the irrationality of the body, we shall, in all likelihood, be in the company of others in like state, and we shall behold with our own eyes the pure and absolute, which is the truth; since for the impure to touch the pure may well be against the divine ordinance.</q> </p><p rend="indent">So, even if it be likely that death transports us into another place, it is not an evil; for it may possibly prove to be a good, as Plato has shown. Wherefore very wonderful were the words which Socrates <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic" >Apology</title>, p. 29 A.</note> uttered before his judges, to this effect: <q>To be afraid of death, Sirs, is nothing else than to seem to be wise when one is not; for it is to seem to know what one does not know. For in regard to death nobody knows even whether it happens to be for mankind the greatest of all good things, yet they fear it as if they knew well that it is the greatest of evils.</q> From this view it seems that the poet does not dissent who says: <pb xml:id="v.2.p.145"/> <quote rend="blockquote">Let none fear death, which is release from toils,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Author unknown; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat">Trag.

As a result of this inquiry Pindar inferred that he should expect death, and after a short time his end came. </p><p rend="indent">They say that the following incident happened to the Italian Euthynoüs.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The story comes from Crantor’s <title xml:lang="lat">Consolatio</title>, according to Cicero.</note> He was the son of Elysius, of Terina, a man foremost among the people there in virtue, wealth, and repute, and Euthynoüs came to his end suddenly from some unknown cause. Now it occurred to Elysius, as it might have occurred to anybody large property and estate. Being in perplexity as to how he might put his suspicions to the test, he visited a place where the spirits of the dead are conjured up, and having offered the preliminary sacrifice prescribed by custom, he lay down to sleep in the place, and had this vision. It seemed that his own father came to him, and that on seeing his father he related to him what had happened touching his son, and begged and besought his help to discover the man who was responsible for his son’s death. And his father said, <q type="unspecified" >It is for this that I am come. Take from this person here what he brings for you, and from this you will learn about everything over which you are now grieving.</q> The person whom he indicated was a young man who followed him, resembling his son Euthynoüs and close to him in years and stature. <pb xml:id="v.2.p.149"/> So Elysius asked who he was; and he said, <q>I am the ghost of your son,</q> and with these words he handed him a paper.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p rend="indent">If, however, death is really a complete destruction and dissolution of both body and soul (for this was the third of Socrates’ conjectures), even so it is not an evil. For, according to him, there ensues a sort of insensibility and a liberation from all pain and anxiety. For just as no good can attach to us in such a state, so also can no evil; for just as the good, from its nature, can exist only in the case of that which is and has substantiality, so it is also with the evil. But in the case of that which is not, but has been removed from the sphere of being, neither of them can have any real existence. Now those who have died return to the same state in which they were before birth; therefore, as nothing was either good or evil for us before birth, even so will it be with us after death. And just as all events before our lifetime were nothing to us, even so will all events subsequent to our lifetime be nothing to us.

But if there is no difference in these cases, it is evident that there is no difference in the case of death, either, as compared with the condition before birth.

Mourning did not happen to be present, but arrived after the distribution had been made. But when she said it was only right that some honour be given to her also, Zeus, being perplexed, since all the honours had been used up, finally gave her that honour which is paid in the case of those who have died—tears and griefs. Just as the other deities, therefore, are fond of those by whom they are honoured, so also is Mourning. <q>Therefore, Madame, if you treat her with disrespect, she will not come near you; but if she is strictly honoured by you with the honours which were conceded to her, namely griefs and lamentations, she will love you and affectionately will be ever with you, provided only she be constantly honoured by you.</q> Admirably, it appears, he succeeded, by this story, in convincing the woman and in alleviating her mourning and lamentations. <pb xml:id="v.2.p.163"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p rend="indent">In general one might say to the man who mourns, <q>Shall you at some time cease to take this to heart, or shall you feel that you must grieve always every day of your life ? For if you purpose to remain always in this extreme state of affliction, you will bring complete wretchedness and the most bitter misery upon yourself by the ignobleness and cowardice of your soul. But if you intend some time to change your attitude, why do you not change it at once and extricate yourself from this misfortune ? Give attention now to those arguments by the use of which, as time goes on, your release shall be accomplished, and relieve yourself now of your sad condition. For in the case of bodily afflictions the quickest way of relief is the better.

For grief stands in the way of sane counsel about an event and prevents one from arranging his affairs with relation to what has befallen, as a player does at a throw of the dice, in whatever way reason may convince him would be best. We ought not, therefore, when we have fallen to act like children and hold on to the injured place and scream, but we should accustom our soul speedily to concern itself with curing the injury and raising up the fallen, and we should put away lamentation by remedial art.</q> </p><p rend="indent">They say that the lawgiver of the Lyclans <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Valerius Maximus, ii. 6. 13.</note> ordered his citizens, whenever they mourned, to clothe themselves first in women’s garments and then to mourn, wishing to make it clear that mourning is womanish and unbecoming to decorous men who lay claim to the education of the free-born. Yes, mourning is verily feminine, and weak, and ignoble, since <pb xml:id="v.2.p.167"/> women are more given to it than men, and barbarians more than Greeks, and inferior men more than better men; and of the barbarians themselves, not the most noble, Celts and Galatians, and all who by nature are filled with a more manly spirit, but rather, if such there are, the Egyptians and Syrians and Lydians and all those who are like them. For it is recorded that some of these go down into pits and remain there for several days, not desiring even to behold the light of the sun since the deceased also is bereft of it. At any rate the tragic poet Ion,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 743, Ion, No. 54.</note> who was not without knowledge of the foolishness of these peoples, has represented a woman as saying: <quote rend="blockquote">The nurse of lusty children I have come, To supplicate you, from the mourning pits.</quote> And some of the barbarians even cut off parts of their bodies, their noses and ears, and mutilate other portions of their bodies also, thinking to gratify the dead by abandoning that moderation of feeling which Nature enjoins in such cases. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p rend="indent">But I dare say that, in answer to this, some may assert their belief that there need not be mourning for every death, but only for untimely deaths, because of the failure of the dead to gain what are commonly held to be the advantages of life, such as marriage, education, manhood, citizenship, or public office (for these are the considerations, they say, which most cause grief to those who suffer misfortune through untimely deaths, since they are robbed of their hope out of due time); but they do not realize that the untimely death shows no disparity if it be considered with reference to the <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, Trag. Graec. Frag. p. 743, Ion, No. 54.</note> <pb xml:id="v.2.p.169"/> common lot of man. For just as when it has been decided to migrate to a new fatherland, and the journey is compulsory for all, and none by entreaty can escape it, some go on ahead and others follow after, but all come to the same place; in the same manner, of all who are journeying toward Destiny those who come more tardily have no advantage over those who arrive earlier. If it be true that untimely death is an evil, the most untimely would be that of infants and children, and still more that of the newly born. But such deaths we bear easily and cheerfully, but the deaths of those who have already lived some time with distress and mourning because of our fanciful notion, born of vain hopes, since we have come to feel quite assured of the continued tarrying with us of persons who have lived so long. But if the years of man’s life were but twenty, we should feel that he who passed away at fifteen had not died untimely, but that he had already attained an adequate measure of age, while the man who had completed the prescribed period of twenty years, or who had come close to the count of twenty years, we should assuredly deem happy as having lived through a most blessed and perfect life. But if the length of life were two hundred years, we should certainly feel that he who came to his end at one hundred was cut off untimely, and we should betake ours elves to wailing and lamentation. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p rend="indent">It is evident, therefore, that even the death which we call untimely readily admits of consolation, both for these reasons and for those previously given.

Me, last of all, at the very front doors shall the dogs tear to pieces, Ravening, eager for blood, when a foeman wielding his weapon, Keen-edged of bronze, by a stroke or a throw, takes the life from my body. Yet when the dogs bring defilement on hair and on beard that is hoary, And on the body as well of an old man slain by the foeman, This is the saddest of sights ever seen by us unhappy mortals. Thus did the old man speak, and his hoary locks plucked by the handful, Tearing his hair from his head, but he moved not the spirit of Hector.</quote> Since you have, then, so very many examples <pb xml:id="v.2.p.173"/> regarding the matter, bear in mind the fact that death relieves not a few persons from great and grievous ills which, if they had lived on, they would surely have experienced. But, out of regard for the due proportions of my argument, I omit these, contenting myself with what has been said touching the wrongfulness of being carried away beyond natural and moderate bounds to futile mourning and ignoble lamentation. </p> </div>

But affection and love for the departed does not consist in distressing ourselves, but in benefiting the beloved one; and a benefit for those who have been taken away is the honour paid to them through keeping their memory green. For no good man, after he is dead, is deserving of lamentations, but of hymns and songs of joy; not of mourning, but of an honourable memory; not of sorrowing tears, but of offerings of sacrifice,—if the departed one is now a partaker in some life more divine, relieved of servitude to the body, and of these everlasting cares and misfortunes which those who have received a mortal life as their portion are constrained to undergo until such time as they shall complete their allotted earthly existence, which Nature has not given to us for eternity; but she has distributed to us severally the apportioned amount in accordance with the laws of fate. </p> </div>

It is accordingly the mark of a madman thus to assume that he shall keep his mourning permanently. If, however, men should reason that mourning will come to an end after some particular event, they might go on and reason that it will come to an end when time, forsooth, has produced some effect; for not even God can undo what has been done.

It is better to quote the very words of the philosopher. He says, in the work which is entitled Eudemus, or Of the Soul, the following: <q><q>Wherefore, O best and blessedest of all, in addition to believing that those who have ended this life are blessed and happy, we also think that to say anything false or slanderous against them is impious, from our feeling that it is directed against those who have already become our betters and superiors.

And the other, again taking up the discourse, said: <q>That not to be born is the best of all, and that to be dead is better than to live. And the proof that this is so has been given to many men by the deity. So, for example, they say that Silenus, after the hunt in which Midas of yore had captured him, when Midas questioned and inquired of him what is the best thing for mankind and what is the most preferable of all things, was at first unwilling to tell, but maintained a stubborn silence. But when at last, by employing every device, Midas induced him to say something to him, Silenus, forced to speak, said: <q>Ephemeral offspring of a travailing genius and of harsh fortune, why do you force me to speak what it were better for you men not to know ? For a life spent in ignorance of one’s own woes is most free from grief. But for men it is utterly impossible that they should obtain the best thing of all, or even have any share in its nature (for the best thing for all men and women is not to be born); however, the next best thing to this, and the first of those to which man can attain, but nevertheless only the second best, is, after being born, to die as quickly as possible.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Theognis, 425; Bacchylidies, v. 160; Sophocles, <title rend="italic">Oed.

And whereas we acquire the good things only with difficulty and at the expense of many anxieties, the evils we acquire very easily. For they say that the latter are compact and conjoined, and are brought together by many influences, while the good things are disjoined, and hardly manage to unite towards the very end of life.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p rend="indent">The divine Plato has said a good deal in his treatise On the Soul about its immortality, and not a little also in the Republic and Meno and Gorgias, and here and there in his other dialogues. What is said in the dialogue On the Soul I will copy, with comments, and send you separately, as you desired. But for the present occasion these words, which were spoken <pb xml:id="v.2.p.207"/> to Callicles the Athenian, the friend and disciple of Gorgias the orator, are timely and profitable. They say that Socrates, according to Plato’s account,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Gorgias</title>, p. 523 A.</note> says: <q>Listen to a very beautiful story, which you, I imagine, will regard as a myth, but which I regard as a story; for what I am going to say I shall relate as true. As Homer <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, xv. 187.</note> tells the tale, Zeus, Poseidon, and Pluto divided the kingdom when they received it from their father. Now this was the custom regarding men even in the time of Cronus, and it has persisted among the gods to this day—that the man who has passed through life justly and in holiness shall, at his death, depart to the Islands of the Blest and dwell in all happiness beyond the reach of evil, while he who has lived an unjust and godless life shall go to the prison-house of justice and punishment, which they call Tartarus. The judges of these men, in the time of Cronus and in the early days of Zeus’s dominion, were living, and judged the living, giving judgement on the day when the men were about to die. As time went on, for some reason the cases were not decided well. Accordingly Pluto and the supervisors in the Islands of the Blest went to Zeus and said to him that there kept coming to them at both places inadmissible persons. <q>Very well,</q> said Zeus, <q>then I shall put a stop to this proceeding. The judgements are now rendered poorly; for,</q> said he, <q>those who are judged are judged with a covering on them, since they are judged while alive, and so,</q> he continued, <q>a good <pb xml:id="v.2.p.209"/> many perhaps who have base souls are clad with beautiful bodies and ancestry and riches, and, when the judgement takes place, many come to testify for them that they have lived righteously. So not only are the judges disconcerted by these things, but at the same time they themselves sit in judgement with a covering on them, having before their own souls, like a veil, their eyes and ears and their whole body. All these things come between, both their own covering and that of those who are being judged. In the first place, then, all their foreknowledge of death must be ended; for now they have foreknowledge of it. So Prometheus has been told to put an end to this. Secondly, they must be judged divested of all these things; for they must be judged after they have died. The judge also must be naked, and dead, that he may view with his very soul the very soul of every man instantly after he has died, and isolated from all his kin, having left behind on earth all earthly adornments, so that his judgement may be just. I, therefore, realizing this situation sooner than you, have made my own sons judges, two from Asia—Minos and Rhadamanthys‚Äîand one from Europe‚ÄîAeacus. These, then, as soon as they have died, shall sit in judgement in the meadow at the parting of the ways whence the two roads lead, the one to the Islands of the Blest and the other to Tartarus. The people of Asia shall Rhadamanthys judge, while Aeacus shall judge the people of Europe; and to Minos I shall give the prerogative of pronouncing final judgement in case the other <pb xml:id="v.2.p.211"/> two be in any doubt, in order that the decision in regard to the route which men must take shall be as just as possible.</q> This, Callicles, is what I have heard, and believe to be true; and from these words I draw the following inference‚—that death is, as it seems to me, nothing else than the severing of two things, soul and body, from each other.</q> </p> </div>

In it is included also for your son, Apollonius, a youth so very dear to the gods, a fitting tribute, which is much coveted by the sanctified—a tribute due to his honourable memory and to his fair fame, which will endure for time eternal. You will do well, therefore, to be persuaded by reason, and, as a favour to your dear departed son, to turn from your unprofitable distress and desolation, which affect both body and soul, and to go back to your accustomed and natural course of life. Forasmuch as your son, while he was living among us, was sorry to see either you or his mother downcast, even so, now that he is with the gods and is feasting with them, he would not be well satisfied with your present course of life. Resume, therefore, the spirit of a brave-hearted and high-minded man who loves his offspring, and set free from all this wretchedness both yourself, the mother of the youth, and your relatives and friends, as you may do by pursuing a more tranquil form of life, which will be most gratifying both to your son and to all of us who are concerned for you, as we rightly should be. </p> </div> </div> </body> </text>
