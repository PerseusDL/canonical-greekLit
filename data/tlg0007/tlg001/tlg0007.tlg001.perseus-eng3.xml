               of the kings in Peloponnesus quite as much on account of the number of his children
               as the amount of his wealth. He gave many daughters in marriage to men of highest
               rank, and scattered many sons among the cities as their rulers. One of these, named
               Pittheus, the grandfather of Theseus, founded the little city of Troezen, and had the
               highest repute as a man versed in the lore of his times and of the greatest wisdom.

               with no woman until he came to Athens. But Aegeus thought the words of the command
               somewhat obscure, and therefore turned aside to Troezen and communicated to Pittheus
               the words of the god, which ran as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote" type="oracle">

               Aegeus did so, and then learning that it was the daughter of Pittheus with whom he
               had consorted, and suspecting that she was with child by him, he left a sword and a
               pair of sandals hidden under a great rock, which had a hollow in it just large enough

               exception was Jason, the commander of the Argo, who sailed about scouring the sea of
               pirates. Now when Daedalus fled from Crete in a merchant-vessel to Athens, Minos,
               contrary to the decrees, pursued him with his ships of war, and was driven from his
               course by a tempest to Sicily, where he ended his life.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Hdt. 7.170">Hdt. 7.170</bibl>;

               their hair, and by smoothing their skin and beautifying their complexions with
               unguents; he also taught them to imitate maidens as closely as possible in their
               speech, their dress, and their gait, and to leave no difference that could be

               because of their part in the story; or rather, because they came back home at the

               in the procession and share in the sacrifice, in imitation of the mothers of the
               young men and maidens on whom the lot fell, for these kept coming with bread and meat
               for their children. And tales are told at this festival, because these mothers, for
               the sake of comforting and encouraging their children, spun out tales for them. At
               any rate, these details are to be found in the history of Demon. Furthermore, a
               sacred precinct was also set apart for Theseus, and he ordered the members of the
               families which had furnished the tribute to the Minotaur to make contributions
               towards a sacrifice to himself. This sacrifice was superintended by the Phytalidae,

           After the death of Aegeus, Theseus conceived a wonderful design, and settled all the

               up to that time had been scattered about and were not easily called together for the

               common town-hall and council-chamber for all on the ground where the upper town of

               celebrate Isthmian games in honor of Poseidon. For the games already instituted there
               in honor of Melicertes were celebrated in the night, and had the form of a religious
               rite rather than of a spectacle and public assembly. But some say that the Isthmian
               games were instituted in memory of Sciron, and that Theseus thus made expiation for
               his murder, because of the relationship between them; for Sciron was a son of
               Canethus and Henioche, who was the daughter of Pittheus. </p>

               that may be, Theseus made a formal agreement with the Corinthians that they should
               furnish Athenian visitors to the Isthmian games with a place of honor as large as
               could be covered by the sail of the state galley which brought them thither, when it
               was stretched to its full extent. So Hellanicus and Andron of Halicarnassus tell us.

               campaign with Heracles against the Amazons, and received Antiope as a reward of his
               valor; but the majority of writers, including Pherecydes, Hellanicus, and Herodorus,
               say that Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles, and
               took the Amazon captive; and this is the more probable story. For it is not recorded

               This last, he says, fell in love with Antiope unbeknown to the rest, and revealed his
               secret to one of his intimate friends. That friend made overtures to Antiope, who
               positively repulsed the attempt upon her, but treated the matter with discretion and

               disturbed, and in his distress called to mind a certain oracle which he had once
               received at Delphi. For it had there been enjoined upon him by the Pythian priestess
               that when, in a strange land, he should be sorest vexed and full of sorrow, he should
               found a city there, and leave some of his followers to govern it. </p>

               their camp within the city, nor fought hand to hand battles in the neighborhood of
               the Pnyx and the Museum, had they not mastered the surrounding country and approached

               the left wing of the Amazons extended to what is now called the Amazoneum, and that
               with their right they touched the Pnyx at Chrysa; that with this left wing the
               Athenians fought, engaging the Amazons from the Museum, and that the graves of those

               Ardettus and the Lyceum, drove their right wing back as far as to their camp, and
               slew many of them. And after three months, he says, a treaty of peace was made
               through the agency of Hippolyta; for Hippolyta is the name which Cleidemus gives to
               the Amazon whom Theseus married, not Antiope. </p>

               what is now called the Amazoneum. But that the war ended in a solemn treaty is

               to correct this heaviest accusation against him, say that he did not carry off Helen
               himself, but that when Idas and Lynceus had carried her off he received her in charge

               no farther than Tegea, and so the two friends, when they had passed through
               Peloponnesus and were out of danger, made a compact with one another that the one on
