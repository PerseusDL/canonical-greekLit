The treatise is one of three similar compilations of wThich two have been preserved and one, the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaestiones Barbaricae</title> (No. 139 in Lamprias’s list), has been lost. Plutarch possessed a great desire to know the reason why: besides the many discussions of a similar sort contained in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Symposiacs</title> (<title rend="italic">Table Talk</title>), there is extant a discussion of <title rend="italic">Physical Causes</title>, and the titles of other writings of the same sort have been preserved for us in Lamprias’s list of Plutarch’s writings.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">(149)<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰτίαι τῶν περιφερομένων Στωικῶν</foreign>; (160)<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰτίαι καὶ τοπόι</foreign>; (161)<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰτίαι ἀλλαγῶν</foreign>; (167)<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰτίαι γυναικῶν</foreign>.</note> </p><p rend="indent">The Greek title, which means <q>causes</q>, is twice mentioned by Plutarch himself in the <title rend="italic">Lives</title>,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Life of Romulus</title>, chap. xv. (26 e); <title rend="italic">Life of Camillus</title> chap. xix. (138 e).</note> and we might call it <q>The Reasons Why.</q> In nearly every case at least two and often more reasons are given: of these presumably not more than one can be right. Thus the other explanations will embody the results of Plutarch’s researches on the matter or his own quaint speculations. Consequently the book, which is an important source for Roman <pb xml:id="v.4.p.3"/> customs, especially for religious customs, has been of the greatest service to students of early Roman religion, a field in which so little is certain and which provides (even as it provided for Plutarch) such glorious opportunities for speculation that it has been somewhat overtilled in recent years. Anyone interested in such matters may observe the trend of this scholarship if he will examine F. B. Jevons’ reprint of Holland’s translation of the <title rend="italic">Roman Questions</title> (London, 1892): or better, H. J. Rose, <title rend="italic">The Roman Questions of Plutarch, a New Translation with Introductory Essays and a Running Commentary</title> (Oxford, 1924). Professor Rose might, indeed, have improved his translation by consulting some good Greek lexicon: but the essays and the commentary are very valuable, for they contain, among other matters of interest, a discussion of Plutarch’s sources and of early Roman religion: the commentary is fortified with abundant references to ancient writers and to modern scholars. It is a scholarly work and the most important contribution to the study of the <title rend="italic">Roman Questions</title> since Wyttenbach. </p><p rend="indent">This treatise could hardly have been written by a person ignorant of Latin. Plutarch in his <title rend="italic">Life of Demosthenes</title>, chap, ii., modestly disavows any profound knowledge of Latin: yet he had read a considerable amount in the language and had spent some time in Rome. Hence he was quite able to use Latin works in compiling the <title rend="italic">Roman Questions</title>. Some Roman writers he mentions by name, especially Varro, and Verrius Flaccus, an antiquarian of the Augustan age. Livy is specifically cited but twice in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, once in the present work and once in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Fortuna Romanorum</title>; yet he is referred <pb xml:id="v.4.p.4"/> to no less than twelve times in the <title rend="italic">Lives</title>, most of these citations being in the <title rend="italic">Marcellus</title> and the <title rend="italic">Camillus</title>. Perhaps Plutarch’s more exact acquaintance with Livy, if he ever acquired this, dates from a time later than the period during which he was engaged in the compilation of the <title rend="italic">Roman Questions</title>. </p><p rend="indent">Other Roman authorities are mentioned occasionally, such as Cato the Elder, Nigidius Figulus, Antistius Labeo, Ateius Capito, and Fenestella: but no doubt they and others are used in accounts introduced by such expressions as <q>they say,</q> <q>some say,</q> <q>the story is told,</q> and the like. Some of these references have, in fact, been traced by scholars to their originals. It has been remarked of Cicero that any statement found in that author’s works appears, or has appeared, elsewhere. The same affirmation might be made of Plutarch with some confidence. Unless he specifically testifies to oral tradition or hearsay, we may be certain that his facts, like Cicero’s, are drawn from his extensive reading. </p><p rend="indent">Critics lay stress on a few mistakes which Plutarch made in interpreting Latin (these will be found noted in Rose and in Hartman), but against them must be set the unnumbered instances in which he is right. He did not, however, have to depend wholly on Latin writers, for he undoubtedly had at hand the <title rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</title> of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1st cent. b.c.) and the works of Juba,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Müller, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> iii. 465-484.</note> the scholarly king of Mauretania, who as a youth had been brought to Rome in 46 b.c. to grace the triumph of Julius Caesar. Juba became greatly interested in Roman <pb xml:id="v.4.p.5"/> customs, and wrote a book in which he paralleled them with the customs of other peoples. </p><p rend="indent">Many of the matters discussed in the <title rend="italic">Roman Questions</title> are to be found treated elsewhere in Plutarch’s work, particularly in the Roman <title rend="italic">Lives</title>. The Lives of <title rend="italic">Romulus</title> and of <title rend="italic">Numa</title> are especially rich in parallel passages: for very many of the Roman customs were thought to go back to the earliest period of Roman history. </p><p rend="indent">The book was probably published after the death of Domitian in a.d, 96, though this is a not quite certain inference from the text (276 e). The work is No. 138 in Lamprias’s catalogue of Plutarch’s works. The . ms. tradition (on which see J. B. Titchener, <title rend="italic">University of Illinois Studies</title>, ix., 1924) is good. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.7"/>

For the even number admits division and its equality of division suggests strife and opposition: the odd number, however, cannot be divided into equal parts at all, but whenever it is divided it always leaves behind a remainder of the same nature as itself. Now, of the odd numbers, five is above all the nuptial number; for three is the first odd number, and two is the first even number, and five is composed of the union of these two, as it were of male and female.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 288 d-e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, 374 a, 429 a, and 388 a with the note on the last passage; Lydus, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Mensibus</title>, ii. 4.</note> </p><p rend="indent">Or is it rather that, since light is the symbol of birth, and women in general are enabled by nature to bear, at the most, five children at one birth,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 429 f.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Why is it that, although there are many shrines of Diana in Rome, the only one into which men may not enter is the shrine in the so-called Vicus Patricius? <pb xml:id="v.4.p.11"/> </p><p rend="indent">Is it because of the current legend? For a man attempted to violate a woman who was here worshipping the goddess, and was torn to pieces by the dogs: and men do not enter because of the superstitious fear that arose from this occurrence. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Why do they, as might be expected, nail up stags’ horns in all the other shrines of Diana, but in the shrine on the Aventine nail up horns of cattle? </p><p rend="indent">Is it because they remember the ancient occurrence?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Livy, i. 45; Valerius Maximus, vii. 3. 1.</note> For the tale is told that among the Sabines in the herds of Antro Curiatius was born a heifer excelling all the others in appearance and size. When a certain soothsayer told him that the city of the man who should sacrifice that heifer to Diana on the Aventine was destined to become the mightiest city and to rule all Italy, the man carne to Rome with intent to sacrifice his heifer. But a servant of his secretly told the prophecy to the king Servius, who told Cornelius the priest, and Cornelius gave instructions to Antro to bathe in the Tiber before the sacrifice: for this, said he, was the custom of those whose sacrifice was to be acceptable. Accordingly Antro went away and bathed, but Servius sacrificed the heifer to Diana before Antro could return, and nailed the horns to the shrine. This tale both Juba<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Müller,<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> iii. p. 470.</note> and Varro have recorded, except that Varro has not noted the name of Antro: and he says that the Sabine was cozened, not by Cornelius the priest, but by the keeper of the temple. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">Why is it that those who are falsely reported to <pb xml:id="v.4.p.13"/> have died in a foreign country, even if they return, men do not admit by the door, but mount upon the roof-tiles and let them down inside? </p><p rend="indent">Varro gives an explanation of the cause that is quite fabulous. For he says that in the Sicilian war there was a great naval battle, and in the case of many men a false report spread that they were dead. But, when they had returned home, in a short time they all carne to their end except one who, when he tried to enter, found the doors shutting against him of their own accord, nor did they yield when he strove to open them. The man fell asleep there before his threshold and in his sleep saw a vision, which instructed him to climb upon the roof and let himself down into the house. When he had done so, he prospered and lived to an advanced age: and from this occurrence the custom became established for succeeding generations. </p><p rend="indent">But consider if this be not in some wise similar to Greek customs; for the Greeks did not consider pure, nor admit to familiar intercourse, nor suffer to approach the temples any person for whom a funeral had been held and a tomb constructed on the assumption that they were dead. The tale is told that Aristinus, a victim of this superstition, sent to Delphi and besought the god to release him from the difficulties in which he was involved because of the custom: and the prophetic priestess gave response: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>All that a woman in childbed does at the birth of her baby, </l> <l>When this again thou hast done, to the blessed gods sacrifice offer.</l> </quote> Aristinus, accordingly, chose the part of wisdom and <pb xml:id="v.4.p.15"/> delivered himself like a new-born babe into the hands of women to be washed, and to be wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and to be suckled: and all other men in such plight do likewise and they are called <q>Men of Later Fate.</q> But some will have it that this was done in the case of such persons even before Aristinus, and that the custom is ancient. Hence it is nothing surprising if the Romans also did not think it right to admit by the door, through which they go out to sacrifice and come in from sacrificing, those who are thought to have been buried once and for all and to belong to the company of the departed, but bade them descend from the open air above into that portion of the house which is exposed to the sky. And with good reason, for, naturally, they perform all their rites of purification under the open sky. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">Why do the women kiss their kinsmen on the lips? </p><p rend="indent">Is it, as most authorities believe, that the drinking of wine was forbidden to women,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Comparison of Lycurgus and Numa</title>, chap. iii.

V. Rose).</note> the philosopher has recorded? For that far-famed deed, the scene of which is laid in many different places,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 243 e and the note <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad loc.</foreign> (Vol. III. p. 480).</note> was dared, it appears, by the Trojan women, even on the very shores of Italy. For when they had reached the coast, and the men had disembarked, the women set fire to the ships, since, at all hazards, they desired to be quit of their wanderings and their sea-faring. <pb xml:id="v.4.p.17"/> But they were afraid of their husbands, and greeted with a kiss and a warm embrace such of their kinsmen and members of their household as they encountered: and when the men had ceased from their wrath and had become reconciled, the women continued thereafter as well to employ this mark of affection towards them. </p><p rend="indent">Or was this rather bestowed upon the women as a privilege that should bring them both honour and power if they should be seen to have many good men among their kinsmen and in their household? </p><p rend="indent">Or is it that, since it is not the custom for men to marry blood relations,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hatzidakis objects to the form<foreign xml:lang="grc">συγγενίδας</foreign>; but the very fact that Polux, iii. 30, characterizes it as<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσχάτως βάρβαρον</foreign> proves (as do inscriptions also) that it was in use.</note> affection proceeded only so far as a kiss, and this alone remained as a token of kinship and a participation therein? For formerly men did not marry women related to them by ties of blood, just as even now they do not marry their aunts or their sisters<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Tacitus, <title rend="italic">Annals</title>, xii. 5-7.</note>; but after a long time they made the concession of allowing wedlock with cousins for the following reason: a man possessed of no property, but otherwise of excellent character and more satisfactory to the people than other public men, had as wife his cousin, an heiress, and was thought to be growing rich from her estate. He was accused on this ground, but the people would not even try the case and dismissed the charge, enacting a decree that ali might marry cousins or more distant relatives: but marriage with nearer kin was prohibited. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">Why is it forbidden for a man to receive a gift from his wife or a wife to receive a gift from her husband?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 143 a.</note> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.19"/> </p><p rend="indent">Is it that, Solon having promulgated a law<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Solon</title>, chap. xxi.

For anyone who accepts what is given learns to regard what is not given to him as belonging to another, with the result that by giving a little to each other they deprive each other of all else that they own. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">Why among the Romans is it forbidden to receive a gift from a son-in-law or from a father-in-law? </p><p rend="indent">Is the father-in-law prevented from receiving a gift from his son-in-law, in order that the gift may not appear ultimately to reach the wife through her father? And is the son-in-law similarly prevented, since it is obviously just that he who may not give shall also not receive? <pb xml:id="v.4.p.21"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">Why is it that, when men who have wives at home are returning either from the country or from abroad, they send ahead to tell their wives that they are coming? </p><p rend="indent">Is it because this is the mark of a man who is confident that his wife is not up to any mischief, whereas coming suddenly and unexpectedly is, as it were, an arrival by stratagem and unfair vigilance: and are they eager to send good tidings about themselves to their wives as if they felt certain that their wives would be longing for them and expecting them? </p><p rend="indent">Or is it rather that the men themselves long to hear news of their wives, if they shall find them safe at home and longing for their husbands? </p><p rend="indent">Or is it because during their husbands’ absence the wives have more household duties and occupations, and also dissensions and outbursts against those of the household? Therefore the notice is given in advance that the wife may rid herself of these matters and make for her husband his welcome home undisturbed and pleasant. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">Why is it that when they worship the gods, they cover their heads, but when they meet any of their fellow-men worthy of honour, if they happen to have the toga over the head, they uncover?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Pliny, <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>, xxviii. 17 (60).</note> </p><p rend="indent">This second fact seems to intensify the difficulty of the first. If, then, the tale told of Aeneas<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <title rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</title>, xii. 16.</note> is true, that, when Diomedes passed by, he covered his head and completed the sacrifice, it is reasonable and consistent with the covering of one’s head in the presence of an enemy that men who meet good <pb xml:id="v.4.p.23"/> men and their friends should uncover. In fact, the behaviour in regard to the gods is not properly related to this custom, but accidentally resembles it; and its observance has persisted since the days of Aeneas. </p><p rend="indent">But if there is anything else to be said, consider whether it be not true that there is only one matter that needs investigation: why men cover their heads when they worship the gods: and the other follows from this.

So, in his boredom, he challenged the god to throw dice with him on fixed terms, as it were: if he should win, he was to obtain some service from the god: but if he should lose, he was to furnish a supper for the god at his own expense and provide a comely girl to spend the night with him. Thereupon he brought out the dice, and threw once for himself and once for the god, and lost. Abiding, therefore, by the terms of his challenge he prepared a somewhat sumptuous repast for the god and fetched Larentia, who openly practised the profession of courtesan. He feasted her, put her to bed in the temple, and, when he departed, locked the doors. The tale is told that the god visited her in the night, not in mortal wise, and bade her on the morrow go into the forum, and pay particular attention to the first man she met, and make him her friend. Larentia arose, therefore, and, going forth, met one of the wealthy men that were unwed and past their prime, whose name was Tarrutius.

Even as some advocates will not have it that a demurrer is a suit, but hold that its effect is the opposite of that of a suit; for a suit brings a case into court and obtains a judgement, while a demurrer takes it out of court and quashes it; in the same way they believe that the tribuneship is a check on officialdom and a position to offer opposition to magistracy rather than a magistracy. For its authority and power consist in blocking the power of a magistrate and in the abrogation of excessive authority. </p><p rend="indent">Or one might expound these matters and others like them, if one were to indulge in the faculty of invention: but since the tribunate derives its origin from the people, the popular element in it is strong: and of much importance is the fact that the tribune does not pride himself above the rest of the people, but conforms in appearance, dress, and manner of life to ordinary citizens. Pomp and circumstance become the consul and the praetor: but the tribune, as Gaius Curio used to say, must allow himself to be trodden upon: he must not be proud of mien, nor difficult of access nor harsh to the multitude, but indefatigable on behalf of others and easy for the multitude to deal with.

Yet they themselves, not many years before, had buried alive two men and two women, two of them Greeks, two Gauls, in the place called the Forum Boarium. It certainly <pb xml:id="v.4.p.127"/> seems strange that they themselves should do this, and yet rebuke barbarians on the ground that they were acting with impiety. </p><p rend="indent">Did they think it impious to sacrifice men to the gods, but necessary to sacrifice them to the spirits?

The soothsayers declared that it was a terrible disgrace for the Vestal Virgins, that it would be bruited far and wide, and that some wanton outrage would be found touching the knights also. Thereupon a barbarian slave of a certain knight gave information against three Vestal Virgins, Aemilia, Licinia, and Marcia, that they had all been corrupted at about the same time, and that they had long entertained lovers, one of whom was Vetutius Barrus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Cicero, <title rend="italic">Brutus</title>, 46 (169); Horace, <title rend="italic">Satires</title>, i. 6. 30, if the emendation is right.</note> the informer’s master. The Vestals, accordingly, were convicted and punished: but, since the deed was plainly atrocious, it was resolved that the priests should consult the Sibylline books.

A weighty testimony to this is the fact that a Roman official does not make treaties or agreements after midday. </p><p rend="indent">Or is it impossible to reckon the beginning and end of the day by sunset and sunrise? For if we follow the method by which most people formulate their definitions, by their perceptions, reckoning the first peep of the sun above the horizon as the beginning of day, and the cutting off of its last rays as the beginning of night, we shall have no equinox: but that night which we think is most nearly equal to the day will plainly be less than that day by the diameter of <pb xml:id="v.4.p.131"/> the sun.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Long before Plutarch’s day the Greeks had calculated the angle subtended by the sun with an accuracy that stood the test of centuries, and was not modified until comparatively recent times. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Archimedes, <title rend="italic">Arenarius</title>, i. 10 (J.

Since, therefore, the beginning of day and night is difficult to determine at the time of the risings and settings of the sun because of the irrationalities which I have mentioned, there is left the zenith or the nadir of the suii to reckon as the beginning. The second is better; for from noon on the sun’s course is away from us to its setting, but from midnight on its course is towards us to its rising. </p> </div>
