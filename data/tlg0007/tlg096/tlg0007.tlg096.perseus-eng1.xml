            <head>ON TRANQUILLITY OF MIND
					(DE TRANQUILLITATE ANIMI)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					It is only natural that this essay should have aroused
					curiosity and speculation about its sources, for Plutarch
					in the very first paragraph conveys the information
					that he has rummaged among his note-books (<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pomnh/mata</foreign>
               <note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Pohlens and Siefert have at times insisted that in spite of the plural there is only <hi rend="italics">one</hi> main source. This lacks all probablity.</note>) in great haste for the material necessary to
					help his friend Paccius to composure in the midst of
					a busy life. R. Hirzel (<hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xiv. 354 if., especially
					373 if.) attempted to show that much was drawn
					from Democritus's <foreign xml:lang="greek">*peri\ eu)qumi/hs</foreign>, some by way of the
					Stoic Panaetius, who, he thought, naturally opposed
					the Abderite's conclusions. R. Heinze (<hi rend="italics">Rheinisches
						Museum</hi>, xlv. 497 ff.) emphasized the relation between
					<hi rend="italics">De Tranquillitate</hi> and <hi rend="italics">De Virtute et Vitio</hi>: both go back
					to a Stoic<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">But Heinze (p. 507) admitted the possibility of some Epicurean excerpts also being used.</note> prototype and <hi rend="italics">De Tranquillitate</hi> to a model
					which has some close relation to the Cynic Bions
					methods of presentation, that is, probably, to Ariston
					of Chios.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">At the same time, O. Hense (<hi rend="italics">Rheinisches Museum</hi>, xlv. 550 ff.) was attempting to trace <hi rend="italics">De Curiositate</hi> to Ariston. Readers of the <hi rend="italics">Jahresberichte</hi> should note that F. Bock (<hi rend="italics">Jbb.</hi>, clii. 1911, p. 334) has not read these articles and is, as often, a thoroughly untrustworthy guide.</note> M. Pohlenz<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See also <hi rend="italics">Zeitschrift f√ºr wissenschaftliche Theologie</hi>, xlviii. 95 and note.</note> (<hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xi. 275 if.), on the

					other hand, found that the source of the essay was
					Epicurean,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">But now Pohlenz (in the Teubner ed., 1929) has become partially converted to Siefert's views, while rightly continuing to maintain some Epicurean influence. The fact that Plutarch in the last part of his work follows the <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)xaristi/a</foreign> to the gifts of Fortune urged by Epicurus (Fragg. 435 and 491 ed. Usener) seems to me decisive, in spite of Siefert's evasions.</note> while admitting that Plutarch added a
					certain amount of original material to fit the personality and circumstances of the friend he was addressing. Finally, G. Siefert<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">For the structure of the essay see Siefert's earlier work (<hi rend="italics">Commentationes Ienenses</hi>, vi. 1896, pp. 57-74), supplemented and corrected by Pohlenz, <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi>
               </note> (<hi rend="italics">Plutarchs Schrift</hi> 
               <foreign xml:lang="greek">*peri\ eu)qumi/as</foreign>,
					Progr. Pforta, Naumburg, 1908) reverts to
					Democritus and Panaetius, with particular emphasis
					on the material illustrative of Panaetius's lost work
					to be found in Cicero's <hi rend="italics">De Officiis</hi> and in Seneca:
					Panaetius, who was following, not the Stoa, but
					Democritus, is the principal source of Plutarch,
					practically his only source.
				</p>
            <p>
					Siefert's discussion, in particular, is impressive
					as well as learned ; but I would remark that all
					these authorities may well be right-and wrong.
					Some of them admit that portions, at least, of the
					essay were written, or adapted, especially to suit the
					particular occasion for which the essay was composed.
					Plutarch himself is not averse to naming authorities
					here and elsewhere ; that he followed exclusively one,
					or even two, is made very unlikely by his own
					opening statement and by the very mixed nature of
					his philosophical terminology.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This conclusion bears some resemblance to that reached by H. N. Fowler (<hi rend="italics">Harvard Stud. Cl. Phil.</hi>, i. 149 ff.), whose work is called by Siefert <q>noch unergiebiger</q> than the <q>Biomanie</q> of the Hense-Heinze school; but Fowler was inclined to stress too mcuh the relation to Democritus and the parallels which Hirzel had urged between Seneca and Plutarch. That Seneca's <hi rend="italics">De Tranquillitate Animi</hi> goes back to an immediate original common to Plutarch's work also is extremely unlikely. Only one anecdote, one quotation, and a dozen or so commonplaces are not nearly enough to show any close relationship. And how dissimilar the two works are in treatment, design, terminology, and form (<hi rend="italics">pace</hi> Hirzel, <hi rend="italics">Der Dialog</hi>, ii. p. 28, n. 1)!</note>

            <pb n="v.6.p.165"/>
            <p>
					Theological writers of all ages have made good use
					of this store-house of moral precepts. Many of the
					imitations in the works of St. Basil and of St. John
					Chrysostom will be found listed in the Teubner
					edition and discussed by Pohlenz (<hi rend="italics">Zeit.f. wiss. Theologie</hi>,
					xlviii. 72-95). Jeremy Taylor, also, in <hi rend="italics">Holy Living</hi>,
					ii. 6, has again made some pleasant borrowings and
					paraphrases.
				</p>
            <p>
					Sir Thomas Wyat's interesting translation of 1528,
					made from the Latin of Budaeus, has been reprinted,
					with an excellent introduction from the pen of C. R.
					Baskervill, by the authorities of the Huntington
					Library (Harvard University Press, 1931).
				</p>
            <p>
					The ms. tradition is not good. Many passages are
					probably hopelessly corrupt and the reconstructions
					offered in the Teubner text and here are, at the best,
					make-shifts. The work is No. 95 in the catalogue of
					Lamprias.

            <p>It was only very recently that I received your

					use, believing that you on your part requested this
					discourse, not for the sake of hearing a work which
					would aim at elegance of style, but for the practical
					use in living it might afford ; and I congratulate you
					because, though you have commanders as your friends
					and a reputation second to none of the forensic

					And how else can this be achieved except through
					reason, which has been carefully trained quickly to
					hold back the passionate and irrational part of the
					soul when it breaks bounds, as it often does, and
					not to allow it to flow away and be swept downstream

					just as Xenophon<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cyropaedia</hi>, i. 6. 3.</note> advised that in prosperity we should
					be particularly mindful of the gods and should honour
					them, so that, when some need comes upon us, we
					may invoke them with the confidence that they are
					already well-disposed and friendly ; so also with such
					reasonings as give help in controlling the passions :
					wise men should give heed to them before the passions
					arise in order that, being prepared far in advance,
					their help may be more efficacious. For as savage
					dogs become excited at every strange cry and are
					soothed by the familiar voice only, so also the passions
					of the soul, when they are raging wild, are not easily

					And yet it is true that a state of bodily stupor is a bad

					to lead an inactive life ; tranquillity and discontent
					should be determined, not by the multitude or the

					For the universe is a most holy temple and most

					watches the Pythian games or as he drinks at the
					festival of Cronus ; but by spending the greater part
					of life in lamentation and heaviness of heart and
					carking cares men shame the festivals with which the
					god supplies us and in which he initiates us. And
					though men delight in sweetly sounding instruments
					and singing birds, and take pleasure in seeing animals
					romping and frisking, and, on the contrary, are displeased when they howl and bellow and look fierce ;
					yet though they see that their own life is unsmiling
					and dejected and ever oppressed and afflicted by the
					most unpleasant experiences and troubles and unending cares, they not only do not provide themselves with some alleviation or ease-from what
					source could they do so? - but even when others urge
					them, they do not accept a word of admonition by
					following which they would acquiesce in the present
					without fault-finding, remember the past with thankfulness, and meet the future without fear or suspicion,
					with their hopes cheerful and bright.
