<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <pb xml:id="v.6.p.163"/> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent"> It is only natural that this essay should have aroused curiosity and speculation about its sources, for Plutarch in the very first paragraph conveys the information that he has rummaged among his note-books (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπομνήματα</foreign> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pohlens and Siefert have at times insisted that in spite of the plural there is only <emph>one</emph> main source. This lacks all probablity.</note>) in great haste for the material necessary to help his friend Paccius to composure in the midst of a busy life. R. Hirzel (<title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xiv. 354 if., especially 373 if.) attempted to show that much was drawn from Democritus’s <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ εὐθυμίης</foreign>, some by way of the Stoic Panaetius, who, he thought, naturally opposed the Abderite’s conclusions. R. Heinze (<title rend="italic">Rheinisches Museum</title>, xlv. 497 ff.) emphasized the relation between <title rend="italics" xml:lang="lat">De Tranquillitate</title> and <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Virtute et Vitio</title>: both go back to a Stoic<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">But Heinze (p. 507) admitted the possibility of some Epicurean excerpts also being used.</note> prototype and <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Tranquillitate</title> to a model which has some close relation to the Cynic Bions methods of presentation, that is, probably, to Ariston of Chios.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">At the same time, O. Hense (<title rend="italic">Rheinisches Museum</title>, xlv. 550 ff.) was attempting to trace <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Curiositate</title> to Ariston. Readers of the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Jahresberichte</title> should note that F. Bock (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Jbb.</title>, clii. 1911, p. 334) has not read these articles and is, as often, a thoroughly untrustworthy guide.</note> M. Pohlenz<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie</title>, xlviii. 95 and note.</note> (<title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xi. 275 if.), on the <pb xml:id="v.6.p.164"/> other hand, found that the source of the essay was Epicurean,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">But now Pohlenz (in the Teubner ed., 1929) has become partially converted to Siefert’s views, while rightly continuing to maintain some Epicurean influence. The fact that Plutarch in the last part of his work follows the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐχαριστία</foreign> to the gifts of Fortune urged by Epicurus (Fragg. 435 and 491 ed. Usener) seems to me decisive, in spite of Siefert’s evasions.</note> while admitting that Plutarch added a certain amount of original material to fit the personality and circumstances of the friend he was addressing. Finally, G. Siefert<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the structure of the essay see Siefert’s earlier work (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Commentationes Ienenses</title>, vi. 1896, pp. 57-74), supplemented and corrected by Pohlenz, <foreign xml:lang="lat">l.c.</foreign> </note> (<title rend="italic">Plutarchs Schrift</title> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ εὐθυμίας</foreign>, Progr. Pforta, Naumburg, 1908) reverts to Democritus and Panaetius, with particular emphasis on the material illustrative of Panaetius’s lost work to be found in Cicero’s <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Officiis</title> and in Seneca: Panaetius, who was following, not the Stoa, but Democritus, is the principal source of Plutarch, practically his only source. </p> <p rend="indent"> Siefert’s discussion, in particular, is impressive as well as learned; but I would remark that all these authorities may well be right-and wrong. Some of them admit that portions, at least, of the essay were written, or adapted, especially to suit the particular occasion for which the essay was composed. Plutarch himself is not averse to naming authorities here and elsewhere; that he followed exclusively one, or even two, is made very unlikely by his own opening statement and by the very mixed nature of his philosophical terminology.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This conclusion bears some resemblance to that reached by H. N. Fowler (<title rend="italic">Harvard Stud. Cl. Phil.</title>, i. 149 ff.), whose work is called by Siefert <q xml:lang="deu">noch unergiebiger</q> than the <q>Biomanie</q> of the Hense-Heinze school; but Fowler was inclined to stress too mcuh the relation to Democritus and the parallels which Hirzel had urged between Seneca and Plutarch. That Seneca’s <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Tranquillitate Animi</title> goes back to an immediate original common to Plutarch’s work also is extremely unlikely. Only one anecdote, one quotation, and a dozen or so commonplaces are not nearly enough to show any close relationship. And how dissimilar the two works are in treatment, design, terminology, and form (<foreign xml:lang="lat">pace</foreign> Hirzel, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Der Dialog</title>, ii. p. 28, n. 1)!</note> </p> <pb xml:id="v.6.p.165"/> <p rend="indent"> Theological writers of all ages have made good use of this store-house of moral precepts. Many of the imitations in the works of St. Basil and of St. John Chrysostom will be found listed in the Teubner edition and discussed by Pohlenz (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Zeit.f. wiss. Theologie</title>, xlviii. 72-95). Jeremy Taylor, also, in <title rend="italic">Holy Living</title>, ii. 6, has again made some pleasant borrowings and paraphrases. </p> <p rend="indent"> Sir Thomas Wyat’s interesting translation of 1528, made from the Latin of Budaeus, has been reprinted, with an excellent introduction from the pen of C. R. Baskervill, by the authorities of the Huntington Library (Harvard University Press, 1931). </p> <p rend="indent"> The ms. tradition is not good. Many passages are probably hopelessly corrupt and the reconstructions offered in the Teubner text and here are, at the best, make-shifts. The work is No. 95 in the catalogue of Lamprias. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.6.p.167"/>

And at the same time it chanced that our friend Eros<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See 453 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> was obliged to sail at once for Rome, since he had received from the excellent Fundanus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The principal speaker of <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Cohibenda Ira</title>, 452 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> a letter, which, in his usual style, urged haste. But since I neither had the time I might have desired to meet your wishes nor could I bring myself to let the friend who carne from me be seen arriving at your home with hands quite empty, I gathered together from my note-books those observations on tranquillity of mind which I happened to have made for my own use, believing that you on your part requested this discourse, not for the sake of hearing a work which would aim at elegance of style, but for the practical use in living it might afford; and I congratulate you because, though you have commanders as your friends and a reputation second to none of the forensic <pb xml:id="v.6.p.169"/> speakers of our day, your experience has not been that of Merops in the play, and because it cannot be said of you, as of him, that <quote rend="blockquote">The plaudits of the mob have driven you<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Trag.

For what power is there in money or fame or influence at court to help us to gain ease of soul or an untroubled life, if it is not true that the use of them is pleasant to us when we have them and that we never miss them when we have them not?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Frag. <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Contra Divitias</title>, 2 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 123); Lucretius, iii. 957: <quote xml:lang="lat">semper avet quod abest</quote>.</note> And how else can this be achieved except through reason, which has been carefully trained quickly to hold back the passionate and irrational part of the soul when it breaks bounds, as it often does, and not to allow it to flow away and be swept downstream because it does not have what it wants? Therefore, just as Xenophon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Cyropaedia</title>, i. 6. 3.</note> advised that in prosperity we should be particularly mindful of the gods and should honour them, so that, when some need comes upon us, we may invoke them with the confidence that they are already well-disposed and friendly; so also with such reasonings as give help in controlling the passions: wise men should give heed to them before the passions arise in order that, being prepared far in advance, their help may be more efficacious. For as savage dogs become excited at every strange cry and are soothed by the familiar voice only, so also the passions of the soul, when they are raging wild, are not easily <pb xml:id="v.6.p.171"/> allayed, unless customary and familiar arguments are at hand to curb the excited passions. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"> <p rend="indent">Now he<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Democritus; Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. d.

For if that were true, women ought to be more tranquil than men, since for the most part they keep at home; but as it is, the North Wind <quote rend="blockquote">Blows not through the soft-skinned maid,</quote> as Hesiod<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 519, where the poet adds <q>who stays indoors with her dear mother.</q> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 516 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> says, yet more pain and excitement and despondency than one could enumerate, caused by jealousy and superstitition and ambition and vain <pb xml:id="v.6.p.173"/> imaginings, seep into the women’s quarters. And though Laërtes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title>, i. 191.</note> lived twenty years by himself in the country <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>With one old woman, who his food and drink </l> <l>Would place beside him,</l> </quote> and abandoned his birthplace,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, the town of Ithaca; he continued to live on the island.</note> his home, and his kingship, yet he had grief as an ever-constant companion of his inactivity and dejection. And for some persons, even inactivity itself often leads to discontent, as in this instance: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The swift Achilles, Peleus’ noble son, </l> <l>Continued in his wrath beside the ships; </l> <l>Nor would he ever go to council that </l> <l>Ennobles men, nor ever go to war, </l> <l>But wasted away his heart, remaining there, </l> <l>And always longed for tumult and for war.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, i. 488 ff.</note> </l> </quote> And he himself is greatly disturbed and distressed at this and says: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But here I sit beside my ships,</l> <l>A useless burden to the earth.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ibid.</foreign> xviii. 104.</note></l> </quote> For this reason not even Epicurus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Usener, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Epicurea</title>, p. 328, Frag. 555.

But he is absurd in urging public life, not on those who are able to undertake it, but on those who are unable <pb xml:id="v.6.p.175"/> to lead an inactive life; tranquillity and discontent should be determined, not by the multitude or the fewness of one’s occupations, but by their excellence or baseness; for the omission of good acts is no less vexatious and disturbing than the commission of evil acts, as has been said.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Probably by Democritus (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Frag. 256), not Plutarch.</note> </p> </div>

And though men delight in sweetly sounding instruments and singing birds, and take pleasure in seeing animals romping and frisking, and, on the contrary, are displeased when they howl and bellow and look fierce; yet though they see that their own life is unsmiling and dejected and ever oppressed and afflicted by the most unpleasant experiences and troubles and unending cares, they not only do not provide themselves with some alleviation or ease-from what source could they do so? - but even when others urge them, they do not accept a word of admonition by following which they would acquiesce in the present without fault-finding, remember the past with thankfulness, and meet the future without fear or suspicion, with their hopes cheerful and bright. </p> </div> </div>
