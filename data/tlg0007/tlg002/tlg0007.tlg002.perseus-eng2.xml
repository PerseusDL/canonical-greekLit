         <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>From whom, and for what reason the great name of Rome, so famous among mankind, was given to that city, writers are not agreed. Some say that the Pelasgians, after wandering over most of the habitable earth and subduing most of mankind, settled down on that site, and that from their <emph>strength</emph> in war they called their city Rome. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Others say that at the taking of Troy some of its people escaped, found sailing vessels, were driven by storms upon the coast of Tuscany, and came to anchor in the river Tiber; that here, while their women were perplexed and distressed at thought of the sea, one of them, who was held to be of superior birth and the greatest understanding, and whose name was Roma, proposed that they should burn the ships<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
               <bibl n="Verg. A. 5.604">Cf. <title>Aeneid</title>, v. 604-699.</bibl>
            </note>; 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>that when this was done, the men were angry at first, but afterwards, when they had settled of necessity on the Palatine, seeing themselves in a little while more prosperous than they had hoped, since they found the country good and the neighbours made them welcome, they paid high honours to Roma, and actually named the city after her, since she had been the occasion of their founding it. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And from that time on, they say, it has been customary for the women to salute their kinsmen and husbands with a kiss; for those women, after they had burned the ships, made use of such tender salutations as they supplicated their husbands and sought to appease their wrath.</p>
</div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
				        
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Others again say that the Roma who gave her name to the city was a daughter of Italus and Leucaria, or, in another account, of Telephus the son of Heracles; and that she was married to Aeneas, or, in another version, to Ascanius the son of Aeneas. Some tell us that it was Romanus, a son of Odysseus and Circe, who colonized the city; others that it was Romus, who was sent from Troy by Diomedes the son of Emathion; and others still that it was Romis, tyrant of the Latins, after he had driven out the Tuscans, who passed from Thessaly into Lydia, and from Lydia into Italy. Moreover, even those writers who declare, in accordance with the most authentic tradition, that it was Romulus who gave his name to the city, do not agree about his lineage. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For some say that he was a son of Aeneas and Dexithea the daughter of Phorbas, and was brought to Italy in his infancy, along with his brother Romus; that the rest of the vessels were destroyed in the swollen river, but the one in which the boys were was gently directed to a grassy bank, where they were unexpectedly saved, and the place was called Roma from them. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Others say it was Roma, a daughter of the Trojan woman I have mentioned, who was wedded to Latinus the son of Telemachus and bore him Romulus; others that Aemilia, the daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, bore him to Mars; and others still rehearse what is altogether fabulous concerning his origin. For instance, they say that Tarchetius, king of the Albans, who was most lawless and cruel, was visited with a strange phantom in his house, namely, a phallus rising out of the hearth and remaining there many days. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Now there was an oracle of Tethys in Tuscany, from which there was brought to Tarchetius a response that a virgin must have intercourse with this phantom, and she should bear a son most illustrious for his valour, and of surpassing good fortune and strength. Tarchetius, accordingly, told the prophecy to one of his daughters, and bade her consort with the phantom; but she disdained to do so, and sent a handmaid in to it. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>When Tarchetius learned of this, he was wroth, and seized both the maidens, purposing to put them to death.  But the goddess Hestia appeared to him in his sleep and forbade him the murder. He therefore imposed upon the maidens the weaving of a certain web in their imprisonment, assuring them that when they had finished the weaving of it, they should then be given in marriage. By day, then, these maidens wove, but by night other maidens, at the command of Tarchetius, unravelled their web. And when the handmaid became the mother of twin children by the phantom, Tarchetius gave them to a certain Teratius with orders to destroy them. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>This man, however, carried them to the river-side and laid them down there. Then a she-wolf visited the babes and gave them suck, while all sorts of birds brought morsels of food and put them into their mouths, until a cow-herd spied them, conquered his amazement, ventured to come to them, and took the children home with him. Thus they were saved, and when they were grown up, they set upon Tarchetius and overcame him. At any rate, this is what a certain Promathion says, who compiled a history of Italy.</p></div>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
				        
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>But the story which has the widest credence and the greatest number of vouchers was first published among the Greeks, in its principal details, by Diodes of Peparethus, and Fabius Pictor follows him in most points. Here again there are variations in the story, but its general outline is as follows. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>The descendants of Aeneas reigned as kings in Alba, and the succession devolved at length upon two brothers, Numitor and Amulius.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
               <bibl n="Liv. 1.3">Cf. Livy, i. 3.</bibl>
            </note> Amulius divided the whole inheritance into two parts, setting the treasures and the gold which had been brought from Troy over against the kingdom, and Numitor chose the kingdom. Amulius, then, in possession of the treasure, and made more powerful by it than Numitor, easily took the kingdom away from his brother, and fearing lest that brother’s daughter should have children, made her a priestess of Vesta, bound to live unwedded and a virgin all her days. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Her name is variously given as Ilia, or Rhea, or Silvia. Not long after this, she was discovered to be with child, contrary to the established law for the Vestals.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
               <bibl n="Liv. 1.4.1">Cf. Livy, i. 4, 1-5.</bibl>
            </note>  She did not, however, suffer the capital punishment which was her due, because the king’s daughter, Antho, interceded successfully in her behalf, but she was kept in solitary confinement, that she might not be delivered without the knowledge of Amulius. Delivered she was of two boys, and their size and beauty were more than human. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Wherefore Amulius was all the more afraid, and ordered a servant to take the boys and cast them away. This servant’s name was Faustulus, according to some, but others give this name to the man who took the boys up. Obeying the king’s orders, the servant put the babes into a trough and went down towards the river, purposing to cast them in; but when he saw that the stream was much swollen and violent, he was afraid to go close up to it, and setting his burden down near the bank, went his way. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Then the overflow of the swollen river took and bore up the trough, floating it gently along, and carried it down to a fairly smooth spot which is now called Kermalus, but formerly Germanus, perhaps because brothers are called 
				<foreign xml:lang="lat">germani.</foreign></p></div>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
				        
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Now there was a wild fig-tree hard by, which they called Ruminalis, either from Romulus, as is generally thought, or because cud-chewing, or <emph>ruminating</emph>, animals spent the noon-tide there for the sake of the shade, or best of all, from the suckling of the babes there; for the ancient Romans called the <gloss>teat</gloss> 
	<foreign xml:lang="lat">ruma,</foreign> and a certain goddess, who is thought to preside over the rearing of young children, is still called Rumilia, in sacrificing to whom no wine is used, and libations of milk are poured over her victims. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Here, then, the babes lay, and the she-wolf of story here gave them suck,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
               <bibl n="Liv. 1.4.6">Cf. Livy, i. 4, 6-7.</bibl>
            </note> and a woodpecker came to help in feeding them and to watch over them. Now these creatures are considered sacred to Mars, and the woodpecker is held in especial veneration and honour by the Latins, and this was the chief reason why the mother was believed when she declared that Mars was the father of her babes. And yet it is said that she was deceived into doing this, and was really deflowered by Amulius himself, who came to her in armour and ravished her.  
			
         
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But some say that the name of the children’s nurse, by its ambiguity, deflected the story into the realm of the fabulous. For the Latins not only called she-wolves 
	<foreign xml:lang="lat">lupae,</foreign> but also women of loose character, and such a woman was the wife of Faustulus, the foster-father of the infants, Acca Larentia by name. Yet the Romans sacrifice also to her, and in the month of April the priest of Mars pours libations in her honour, and the festival is called Larentalia.</p></div>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
				       
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>They pay honours also to another Larentia, for the following reason. The keeper of the temple of Hercules, being at a loss for something to do, as it seems, proposed to the god a game of dice, with the understanding that if he won it himself, he should get some valuable present from the god; but if he lost, he would furnish the god with a bounteous repast and a lovely woman to keep him company for the night. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>On these terms the dice were thrown, first for the god, then for himself, when it appeared that he had lost. Wishing to keep faith, and thinking it right to abide by the contract, he prepared a banquet for the god, and engaging Larentia, who was then in the bloom of her beauty, but not yet famous,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In <bibl n="Plut. Mor. 273a">
                  <title>Morals</title>, p. 273 a</bibl>, she is called a public courtezan.</note> he feasted her in the temple, where he had spread a couch, and after the supper locked her in, assured of course that the god would take possession of her. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And verily it is said that the god did visit the woman, and bade her go early in the morning to the forum, salute the first man who met her, and make him her friend. She was met, accordingly, by one of the citizens who was well on in years and possessed of considerable property, but childless, and unmarried all his life, by name Tarrutius. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>This man took Larentia to his bed and loved her well, and at his death left her heir to many and fair possessions, most of which she bequeathed to the people. And it is said that when she was now famous and regarded as the beloved of a god, she disappeared at the spot where the former Larentia also lies buried. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>This spot is now called Velabrum, because when the river overflowed, as it often did, they used to cross it at about this point in <emph>ferry-boats</emph>, to go to the forum, and their word for <gloss>ferry</gloss> is 
	<foreign xml:lang="lat">velatura.</foreign> But some say that it is socalled because from that point on, the street leading to the Hippodrome<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, the Circus Maximus.</note> from the forum is covered over with <emph>sails</emph> by the givers of a public spectacle, and the Roman word for <gloss>sail</gloss> is 
	<foreign xml:lang="lat">velum.</foreign> It is for these reasons that honours are paid to this second Larentia amongst the Romans. </p></div>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
				       
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As for the babes, they were taken up and reared by Faustulus, a swineherd of Amulius, and no man knew of it; or, as some say with a closer approach to probability, Numitor did know of it, and secretly aided the foster-parents in their task. And it is said that the boys were taken to Gabii to learn letters and the other branches of knowledge which are meet for those of noble birth. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Moreover, we are told that they were named, from 
	<foreign xml:lang="lat">ruma,</foreign> the Latin word for <gloss>teat</gloss>,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
               <bibl n="Plut. Rom. 4.1">Cf. chapter iv. 1.</bibl>
            </note> Romulus and Romus (or Remus), because they were seen sucking the wild beast. Well, the noble size and beauty of their bodies, even when they were infants, betokened their natural disposition; and when they grew up, they were both of them courageous and manly, with spirits which courted apparent danger, and a daring which nothing could terrify. But Romulus seemed to exercise his judgement more, and to have political sagacity, while in his intercourse with their neighbours in matters pertaining to herding and hunting, he gave them the impression that he was born to command rather than to obey. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>With their equals or inferiors they were therefore on friendly terms, but they looked down upon the overseers, bailiffs, and chief herdsmen of the king, believing them to be no better men than themselves, and disregarded both their threats and their anger. They also applied themselves to generous occupations and pursuits, not esteeming sloth and idleness generous, but rather bodily exercise, hunting, running, driving off robbers, capturing thieves, and rescuing the oppressed from violence. For these things, indeed, they were famous far and near.</p></div>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
				       
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>When a quarrel arose between the herdsmen of Numitor and Amulius,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
               <bibl n="Liv. 1.5.3">Cf. Livy, i. 5, 3 ff.</bibl>
            </note> and some of the latter’s cattle were driven off, the brothers would not suffer it, but fell upon the robbers, put them to flight, and intercepted most of the booty. To the displeasure of Numitor they gave little heed, but collected and took into their company many needy men and many slaves, exhibiting thus the beginnings of seditious boldness and temper. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But once when Romulus was busily engaged in some sacrifice, being fond of sacrifices and of divination, the herdsmen of Numitor fell in with Remus as he was walking with few companions, and a battle ensued. After blows and wounds given and received on both sides, the herdsmen of Numitor prevailed and took Remus prisoner, who was then carried before Numitor and denounced. Numitor himself did not punish his prisoner, because he was in fear of his brother Amulius, who was severe, but went to Amulius and asked for justice, since he was his brother, and had been insulted by the royal servants. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>The people of Alba, too, were incensed, and thought that Numitor had been undeservedly outraged. Amulius was therefore induced to hand Remus over to Numitor himself, to treat him as he saw fit.
			
         When Numitor came home, after getting Remus into his hands, he was amazed at the young man’s complete superiority in stature and strength of body, and perceiving by his countenance that the boldness and vigour of his soul were unsubdued and unharmed by his present circumstances, 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>and hearing that his acts and deeds corresponded with his looks, but chiefly, as it would seem, because a divinity was aiding and assisting in the inauguration of great events, he grasped the truth by a happy conjecture, and asked him who he was and what were the circumstances of his birth, while his gentle voice and kindly look inspired the youth with confidence and hope. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Then Remus boldly said: 
				<q type="spoken">Indeed, I will hide nothing from thee; for thou seemest to be more like a king than Amulius; thou hearest and weighest before punishing, but he surrenders men without a trial. Formerly we believed ourselves (my twin brother and I) children of Faustulus and Larentia, servants of the king; but since being accused and slandered before thee and brought in peril of our lives, we hear great things concerning ourselves; whether they are true or not, our present danger is likely to decide.</q> 
					</p></div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
		<q type="spoken" rend="merge">Our birth is said to have been secret, and our nursing and nurture as infants stranger still. We were cast out to birds of prey and wild beasts, only to be nourished by them,—by the dugs of a she-wolf and the morsels of a woodpecker, as we lay in a little trough by the side of the great river. The trough still exists and is kept safe, and its bronze girdles are engraved with letters now almost effaced, which may perhaps hereafter prove unavailing tokens of recognition for our parents, </q> 
					</p></div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">when we are dead and gone.</q>
			      
         Then Numitor, hearing these words, and conjecturing the time which had elapsed from the young man’s looks, welcomed the hope that flattered him, and thought how he might talk with his daughter concerning these matters in a secret interview; for she was still kept in the closest custody.</p></div>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
				       
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>But Faustulus, on hearing that Remus had been seized and delivered up to Numitor, called upon Romulus to go to his aid, and then told him clearly the particulars of their birth; before this also he had hinted at the matter darkly, and revealed enough to give them ambitious thoughts when they dwelt upon it. He himself took the trough and went to see Numitor, full of anxious fear lest he might not be in season. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Naturally enough, the guards at the king’s gate were suspicious of him, and when he was scrutinized by them and made confused replies to their questions, he was found to be concealing the trough in his cloak. Now by chance there was among the guards one of those who had taken the boys to cast them into the river, and were concerned in their exposure. This man, now seeing the trough, and recognizing it by its make and inscription, conceived a suspicion of the truth, and without any delay told the matter to the king, and brought the man before him to be examined. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>In these dire and pressing straits, Faustulus did not entirely hold his own, nor yet was his secret wholly forced from him. He admitted that the boys were alive and well, but said they lived at a distance from Alba as herdsmen; he himself was carrying the trough to Ilia, who had often yearned to see and handle it, in confirmation of her hope for her children.
			
         
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>As, then, men naturally fare who are confounded, and act with fear or in a passion, so it fell out that Amulius fared. For he sent in all haste an excellent man and a friend of Numitor’s, with orders to learn from Numitor whether any report had come to him of the children’s being alive. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>When, accordingly, the man was come, and beheld Remus almost in the affectionate embraces of Numitor, he confirmed them in their confident hope, and entreated them to proceed at once to action, promptly joining their party himself and furthering their cause. And the opportunity admitted of no delay, even had they wished it; for Romulus was now close at hand, and many of the citizens who hated and feared Amulius were running forth to join him. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>He was also leading a large force with him, divided into companies of a hundred men, each company headed by a man who bore aloft a handful of hay and shrubs tied round a pole (the Latin word for <gloss>handful</gloss> is 
				<foreign xml:lang="lat">manipulus,</foreign> and hence in their armies they still call the men in such companies 
				<foreign xml:lang="lat">manipulares.</foreign>). And when Remus incited the citizens within the city to revolt, and at the same time Romulus attacked from without, the tyrant, without taking a single step or making any plan for his own safety, from sheer perplexity and confusion, was seized and put to death.

				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>To this man Varro gave the problem of fixing the day and hour of the birth of Romulus, making his deductions from the conjunctions of events reported in the man’s life, just as the solutions of geometrical problems are derived; for the same science, he said, must be capable not only of foretelling a man’s life when the time of his birth is known, but also, from the given facts of his life, of hunting out the time of his birth. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>This task, then Tarutius performed, and when he had taken a survey of the man’s experiences and achievements, and had brought together the time of his life, the manner of his death, and all such details, he very courageously and bravely declared that Romulus was conceived in his mother’s womb in the first year of the second Olympiad,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">772 B.C.</note> in the month Choeac of the Egyptian calendar, on the twenty-third day, and in the third hour, when the sun was totally eclipsed; and that he was born in the month Thoth, on the twenty-first day, at sunrise;

These and similar speculations will perhaps attract readers by their novelty and extravagance, rather than offend them by their fabulous character.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
				       
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>When the city was built, in the first place, Romulus divided all the multitude that were of age to bear arms into military companies, each company consisting of three thousand footmen and three hundred horsemen. Such a company was called a 
				<q type="emph">legion,</q> because the warlike were <gloss>selected</gloss> out of all. In the second place, he treated the remainder as a people, and this multitude was called 
				<foreign xml:lang="lat">populus</foreign>; a hundred of them, who were the most eminent, he appointed to be councillors, calling the individuals themselves

				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Now the word

               <bibl n="Liv. 1.8.7">Cf. Livy, i. 8, 7.</bibl>

				<q type="emph">patronage,</q> which was their word for the protection of inferiors, and is so to this day; and they suppose that a certain Patron, one of those who came to Italy with Evander, was a protector and defender of the poor and needy, and left his own name in the word which designates such activity. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But the most reasonable opinion for any one to hold is that Romulus thought it the duty of the foremost and most influential citizens to watch over the more lowly with <emph>fatherly</emph> care and concern, while he taught the multitude not to fear their superiors nor be vexed at their honours, but to exercise goodwill towards them, considering them and addressing them as <emph>fathers</emph>, whence their name of Patricii. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For down to the present time foreign peoples call the members of their senate 
				<q type="emph">chief men,</q> but the Romans themselves call them 
				<q type="emph">conscript fathers,</q> using that name which has the greatest dignity and honour, and awakens the least envy. At first, then, they called them simply 
				<q type="emph">fathers,</q> but later, when more had been added to their number, they addressed them as 
				<q type="emph">conscript fathers.</q> 
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>By this more imposing title Romulus distinguished the senate from the commonalty, and in other ways, too, he separated the nobles from the multitude, calling the one 
				<q type="emph">patrons,</q> that is to say, <gloss>protectors</gloss>, and the other 
				<q type="emph">clients,</q> that is to say, <gloss>dependants</gloss>. At the same time he inspired both classes with an astonishing goodwill towards each other, and one which became the basis of important rights and privileges. For the patrons advised their clients in matters of custom, and represented them in courts of justice, in short, were their counsellors and friends in all things; 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>while the clients were devoted to their patrons, not only holding them in honour, but actually, in cases of poverty, helping them to dower their daughters and pay their debts. And there was neither any law nor any magistrate that could compel a patron to bear witness against a client, or a client against a patron. But in later times, while all other rights and privileges remained in force, the taking of money by those of high degree from the more lowly was held to be disgraceful and ungenerous.

            </note>  And some say that Romulus himself, being naturally fond of war, and being persuaded by sundry oracles, too, that it was the destiny of Rome to be nourished and increased by wars till she became the greatest of cities, thereby merely began unprovoked hostilities against the Sabines; for he did not take many maidens, but thirty only, since what he wanted was war rather than marriages.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But this is not likely. On the contrary, seeing his city filling up at once with aliens, few of whom had wives, while the greater part of them, being a mixed rabble of needy and obscure persons, were looked down upon and expected to have no strong cohesion; and hoping to make the outrage an occasion for some sort of blending and fellowship with the Sabines after their women had been kindly entreated, he set his hand to the task, and in the following manner.
			
         
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>First a report was spread abroad by him that he had discovered an altar of a certain god hidden underground. They called this god Consus, and he was either a god of <emph>counsel</emph> (for

				<q type="foreign">consuls,</q> that is to say, <gloss>counsellors</gloss>), or an equestrian Neptune. For the altar is in the Circus Maximus, and is invisible at all other times, but at the chariot-races it is uncovered. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Some, however, simply say that since counsel is secret and unseen, it is not unreasonable that an altar to the god of counsel should be hidden underground.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The altar was kept buried in the earth to signify thesecret processes of nature in the production of crops and vegetation. For Consus was an ancient Italian god of agriculture.</note>  Now when this altar was discovered, Romulus appointed by proclamation a splendid sacrifice upon it, with games, and a spectacle open to all people. And many were the people who came together, while he himself sat in front, among his chief men, clad in purple. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>The signal that the time had come for the onslaught was to be his rising and folding his cloak and then throwing it round him again. Armed with swords, then, many of his followers kept their eyes intently upon him, and when the signal was given, drew their swords, rushed in with shouts, and ravished away the daughters of the Sabines, but permitted and encouraged the men themselves to escape. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Some say that only thirty maidens were seized, and that from these the Curiae<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The thirty divisions into which the three ancient Roman tribes were divided for political and ceremonial purposes. <bibl n="Liv. 1.13.6">Cf.

            </note> were named; but Valerius Antias puts the number at five hundred and twenty-seven, and Juba at six hundred and eighty-three, all maidens. And this was the strongest defence which Romulus could make, namely, that they took only one married woman, Hersilia, and her by mistake, since they did not commit the rape out of wantonness, nor even with a desire to do mischief, but with the fixed purpose of uniting and blending the two peoples in the strongest bonds. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>As for this Hersilia, some say that she was married to Hostilius, a most eminent Roman, and others, to Romulus himself, and that she also bore him children: one daughter, Prima, so called from the order of birth, and one son only, whom Romulus named Aollius, from the great <gloss>concourse</gloss>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
				       
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Among those who ravished away the maidens at that time, it chanced, they say, that certain men of meaner sort were dragging along a damsel who far surpassed the rest in beauty and stature; and when some men of superior rank met them and tried to rob them of their prize, they cried out that they were conducting the girl to Talasius, a young man, but one of excellent repute. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>The other party, then, on hearing this, shouted and clapped their hands in approval, and some of them actually turned back and accompanied them, out of good will and favour to Talasius, shouting his name as they went along. Hence, indeed, down to the present time, Talasius is the nuptial cry of the Romans, as Hymenaeus is of the Greeks; for they say that Talasius was fortunate in his wife.
			
         But Sextius Sulla, the Carthaginian, a man who lacks neither learning nor charm, told me that Talasius was the word which Romulus gave as a watchword for the rape. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>All those, therefore, who took the maidens away, shouted 
				<q type="spoken">Talasius !</q> and on this account the custom now prevails at marriages. But most writers are of the opinion—and Juba is one of them—that the cry is an exhortation and incitement to industry and 
				<q type="foreign">talasia,</q> as the Greeks call <gloss>spinning</gloss>, Italian words having not yet at that time entirely submerged the Greek. Now if this is right, and the Romans did at that time use the word 
				<q type="foreign">talasia</q> for <gloss>spinning</gloss>, as we do, then a more credible reason for the custom might be conjectured as follows. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>When the Sabines, after their war against the Romans, were reconciled with them, it was agreed that their women should perform no other tasks for their husbands than those which were connected with spinning. It was customary, therefore, at subsequent marriages, for those who gave the bride away, or escorted her to her new home, or simply looked on, to cry 
				<q type="spoken">Talasius!</q> merrily, in testimony that the woman was led home for no other task than that of spinning. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And it continues to be a custom down to the present time that the bride shall not of herself cross the threshold into her new home, but be lifted up and carried in, because the Sabine women were carried in by force, and did not go in of their own accord. And some say also that the custom of parting the bride’s hair with the head of a spear is a reminder that the first marriage was attended with war and fighting; on which topic I have spoken more fully in my

         Leaving such matters aside, the rape was committed on the eighteenth day of the month once called Sextilis, but now, August, on which day the festival of the Consualia<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A harvest festival named from Consus. <bibl n="Plut.

Romulus, then, after making a vow that if he should conquer and overthrow his adversary, he would carry home the man’s armour and dedicate it in person to Jupiter, not only conquered and overthrew him, but also routed his army in the battle which followed, and took his city as well. To the captured citizens, however, he did no harm beyond ordering them to tear down their dwellings and accompany him to Rome, where, he promised them, they should be citizens on equal terms with the rest.
			
         
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Now this, more than anything else, was what gave increase to Rome: she always united and incorporated with herself those whom she conquered. But Romulus, after considering how he might perform his vow in a manner most acceptable to Jupiter and accompany the performance with a spectacle most pleasing to the citizens, cut down a monstrous oak that grew in the camp, hewed it into the shape of a trophy, and fitted and fastened to it the armour of Acron, each piece in its due order.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Then he himself, girding his raiment about him and wreathing his flowing locks with laurel, set the trophy on his right shoulder, where it was held erect, and began a triumphal march, leading off in a paean of victory which his army sang as it followed under arms, and being received by the citizens with joyful amazement. This procession was the origin and model of all subsequent triumphs, and the trophy was styled a dedication to Jupiter Feretrius, so named from the Roman word

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After the capture of the Caeninensians, while the rest of the Sabines were still busy with their preparations, the people of Fidenae, Crustumerium, and Antemnae banded together against the Romans,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
               <bibl n="Liv. 1.11">Cf. Livy, i. 11.</bibl>
            </note> and in a battle which ensued, they were likewise defeated, and surrendered to Romulus their cities to be seized, their territory to be divided, and themselves to be transported to Rome. Romulus distributed among the citizens all the territory thus acquired, excepting that which belonged to the parents of the ravished maidens; this he suffered its owners to keep for themselves.
			
         
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>At this the rest of the Sabines were enraged, and after appointing Tatius their general, marched upon Rome. The city was difficult of access, having as its fortress the present Capitol, on which a guard had been stationed, with Tarpeius as its captain,— not Tarpeia, a maiden, as some say, thereby making Romulus a simpleton. But Tarpeia, a daughter of the commander, betrayed the citadel to the Sabines, having set her heart on the golden armlets which she saw them wearing, and she asked as payment for her treachery that which they wore on their left arms. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Tatius agreed to this, whereupon she opened one of the gates by night and let the Sabines in. Antigonus was not alone, then, in saying that he loved men who offered to betray, but hated those who had betrayed; nor yet Caesar, in saying of the Thracian Rhoemetalces, that he loved treachery but hated a traitor; but this is a very general feeling towards the base on the part of those who need their services, just as they need certain wild creatures for their venom and gall; for while they feel the need of them, they put up with them, but abhor their vileness when they have obtained from them what they want. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>This, too, was the feeling which Tatius then had towards Tarpeia, when he ordered his Sabines, mindful of their agreement, not to begrudge the girl anything they wore on their left arms. And he was first to take from his arm not only his armlet, but at the same time his shield, and cast them upon her. All his men followed his example, and the girl was smitten by the gold and buried under the shields, and died from the number and weight of them. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And Tarpeius also was convicted of treason when prosecuted by Romulus, as, according to Juba, Sulpicius Galba relates. Of those who write differently about Tarpeia, they are worthy of no belief at all who say that she was a daughter of Tatius, the leader of the Sabines, and was living with Romulus under compulsion, and acted and suffered as she did, at her father’s behest; of these, Antigonus is one. And Simylus the poet is altogether absurd in supposing that Tarpeia betrayed the Capitol, not to the Sabines, but to the Gauls, because she had fallen in love with their king. These are his words:—
				<quote rend="blockquote">
					          <l>And Tarpeia, who dwelt hard by the Capitolian steep,</l>
					          <l>Became the destroyer of the walls of Rome;</l>
					          <l>She longed to be the wedded wife of the Gallic chieftain,</l>
					          <l>And betrayed the homes of her fathers.</l>
				        </quote> And a little after, speaking of her death:—
				<quote rend="blockquote">
					          <l>Her the Boni and the myriad tribes of Gauls</l>
					          <l>Did not, exulting, cast amid the currents of the Po;</l>
					          <l>But hurled the shields from their belligerent arms</l>

            </note> Romulus angrily challenged them to battle, and Tatius was bold enough to accept, since he saw that the Sabines, if worsted, had a strong place of retreat. For the intervening space, in which they were to join battle, being surrounded by many hills, seemed to impose upon both parties a sharp and grievous contest, owing to the difficulties of the field, where flight and pursuit must be narrowly confined and short.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>It happened, too, since the river had overflowed not many days before, that a deep and blind slime had been left in the valley where the forum is now.

Accordingly, the place to this day is called from him

Afterwards many conflicts raged within a short time, as might be expected, but one is most memorable, namely the last, in which Romulus was hit on the head with a stone and almost fell to the ground, abandoning his resistance to the Sabines. The Romans thereupon gave way and began to fly to the Palatine, now that they were repulsed from the plain. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But presently Romulus, recovering from his blow, wished to stem the tide of fugitives and renew the battle, and called upon them with a loud voice to stand and fight.

				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>No sooner was his prayer ended than many stopped out of reverence for their king, and courage returned to the fugitives.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>So then both armies were moved to compassion, and drew apart to give the women place between the lines of battle; sorrow ran through all the ranks, and abundant pity was stirred by the sight of the women, and still more by their words, which began with argument and reproach, and ended with supplication and entreaty.

Such is the love which we have here enjoyed, such the compassion shown to us by you.

            </note> and when they would not stand and deliver, slew them. It was a bold and dreadful crime, and Romulus thought its perpetrators ought to be punished at once, but Tatius tried to put off and turn aside the course of justice. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>This was the sole occasion of open variance between them; in all other matters they acted in the utmost concert and administered affairs with unanimity. The friends of the slain ambassadors, shut out as they were from all lawful redress, through the efforts of Tatius, fell upon him as he was sacrificing with Romulus at Lavinium, and killed him, but escorted Romulus on his way with loud praises of his justice. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Romulus brought the body of Tatius home and gave it honourable burial, and it lies near the so-called Armilustrium, on the Aventine hill; but he took no steps whatsoever to bring his murderers to justice. And some historians write that the city of Laurentum, in terror, delivered up the murderers of Tatius, but that Romulus let them go, saying that murder had been requited with murder.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>This led some to say and suspect that he was glad to be rid of his colleague, but it caused no disturbance in the government, nor did it lead the Sabines into faction, nay, some through the good-will they had for him, others through their fear of his power, and others because they regarded him as a benevolent god, all continued to hold him in reverence to the end.
			
         
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Romulus was held in reverence also by many foreign peoples, and the earlier Latins sent ambassadors and established friendship and alliance with him. Fidenae, a neighbouring city to Rome, he took,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">

				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>but others say that the men of Fidenae first made an incursion, driving off booty and devastating the territory and outskirts of the city, and that Romulus set an ambush for them, killed many of them, and took their city. He did not, however, destroy or raze it to the ground, but made it a colony of Rome, and sent thither twenty-five hundred colonists, on the Ides of April.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
				        
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After this, a plague fell upon the land, bringing sudden death without previous sickness upon the people, and afflicting the crops with unfruitfulness and the cattle with barrenness. There was a rain of blood also in the city, so that many superstitious fears were added to their unavoidable sufferings. And when similar calamities visited the people of Laurentum, all agreed at once that it was the miscarriage of justice for the death of Tatius and the slain ambassadors which brought the wrath of heaven down upon both cities. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>The murderers, therefore, were delivered up on both sides and punished, and the mischief visibly abated. Romulus also purified the cities with lustral rites, which they say are celebrated to this day at the Ferentine gate.
			
         But before the pestilence had ceased, the people of Cameria attacked the Romans and overran their territory, thinking them incapable of defending themselves by reason of their distress. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Romulus therefore at once marched against them, overcame them in battle, and killed six thousand of them. He also took their city, transplanted half of the survivors to Rome, and sent to Cameria as colonists from Rome twice the number he had left there, and this on the first of August. So many citizens had he to spare after dwelling in Rome less than sixteen years. Among other spoils he brought also a bronze four-horse chariot from Cameria, and dedicated it in the temple of Vulcan. For it he had a statue made of himself, with a figure of Victory crowning him.</p></div>

And of the Tuscans, the people of Veii, who possessed much territory and dwelt in a great city, were the first to begin war<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">

				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Now this was not only unjust, it was actually ridiculous, that they, who had not come to the aid of the people of Fidenae when they were in the perils of war, but suffered them to perish, then demanded their houses and land from those who had come into possession of them. Accordingly, Romulus gave them contemptuous answers, upon which they divided themselves into two armies, attacked Fidenae with one, and confronted Romulus with the other. Before Fidenae, then, they overpowered two thousand Romans and slew them; but they were defeated by Romulus with a loss of eight thousand men. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Once more a battle was fought near Fidenae, and here all agree that the victory was chiefly due to Romulus himself, who displayed every possible combination of skill and bravery, and seemed endowed with strength and swiftness far beyond the lot of man. But there is a statement made by some writers which is altogether fabulous, nay rather, wholly incredible, namely, that of the fourteen thousand Tuscans who fell in this battle, more than half were slain by Romulus with his own hand; for even the Messenians seem to have been boastfully extravagant in saying that Aristomenes thrice offered sacrifice for a hundred Lacedaemonian enemies slain.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>After the rout of the enemy, Romulus suffered the survivors to escape, and moved upon their city itself. But they could not hold out after so great a reverse, and suing for peace, made a treaty of friendship for a hundred years, giving up a large portion of their territory, called Septempagium, or the <gloss>Seven Districts</gloss>, abandoning their salt-works along the river, and delivering up fifty of their chief men as hostages. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Romulus also celebrated a triumph for this victory on the Ides of October, having in his train, besides many other captives, the leader of the Veientes, an elderly man, who seems to have conducted the campaign unwisely, and without the experience to be expected of his years. Wherefore to this very day, in offering a sacrifice for victory, they lead an old man through the forum to the Capitol, wearing a boy’s toga with a bulla attached to it, while the herald cries:

In this way he taught the influential men at Rome also to seek after a form of government which was independent and without a king, where all in turn were subjects and rulers. For by this time not even the so-called patricians had any share in the administration of affairs, but a name and garb of honour was all that was left them, and they assembled in their council-chamber more from custom than for giving advice.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Wherefore suspicion and calumny fell upon that body when he disappeared unaccountably a short time after. He disappeared on the Nones of July, as they now call the month, then Quintilis, leaving no certain account nor even any generally accepted tradition of his death, aside from the date of it, which I have just given.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>The multitude, accordingly, believing this and rejoicing in it, went away to worship him with good hopes of his favour; but there were some, it is said, who tested the matter in a bitter and hostile spirit, and confounded the patricians with the accusation of imposing a silly tale upon the people, and of being themselves the murderers of the king.</p></div>

				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>He himself, then, affrighted at the sight, had said:  
				<q type="spoken">O King, what possessed thee, or what purpose hadst thou, that thou hast left us patricians a prey to unjust and wicked accusations, and the whole city sorrowing without end at the loss of its father?</q> Whereupon Romulus had replied: 
				<q type="spoken">It was the pleasure of the gods, 0 Proculus, from whom I came, that I should be with mankind only a short time, and that after founding a city destined to be the greatest on earth for empire and glory, I should dwell again in heaven. So farewell, and tell the Romans that if they practise self-restraint, and add to it valour, they will reach the utmost heights of human power. And I will be your propitious deity, Quirinus.</q> 
				        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>These things seemed to the Romans worthy of belief, from the character of the man who related them, and from the oath which he had taken; moreover, some influence from heaven also, akin to inspiration, laid hold upon their emotions, for no man contradicted Proculus, but all put aside suspicion and calumny and prayed to Quirinus, and honoured him as a god.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Now this is like the fables which the Greeks tell about Aristeas of Proconnesus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">

            </note>  For they say that Aristeas died in a fuller’s shop, and that when his friends came to fetch away his body, it had vanished out of sight; and presently certain travellers returning from abroad said they had met Aristeas journeying towards Croton. Cleomedes also, who was of gigantic strength and stature, of uncontrolled temper, and like a mad man, is said to have done many deeds of violence, and finally, in a school for boys, he smote with his fist the pillar which supported the roof, broke it in two, and brought down the house. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>The boys were killed, and Cleomedes, being pursued, took refuge in a great chest, closed the lid down, and held it so fast that many men with their united strength could not pull it up; but when they broke the chest to pieces, the man was not to be found, alive or dead. In their dismay, then, they sent messengers to consult the oracle at Delphi, and the Pythian priestess gave them this answer:—

In short, many such fables are told by writers who improbably ascribe divinity to the mortal features in human nature, as well as to the divine.
			
         At any rate, to reject entirely the divinity of human virtue, were impious and base; but to mix heaven with earth is foolish. Let us therefore take the safe course and grant, with Pindar,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Fragment 131, Bergk, <title>Poet. Lyr. Gr.</title> i.4 p. 427.</note> that

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>To the surname of Quirinus bestowed on Romulus, some give the meaning of <gloss>Mars</gloss>, others that of <gloss>Citizen</gloss> because the citizens were called Quirites; but others say that the ancients called the <gloss>spear-head</gloss> (or the whole <emph>spear)</emph>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>However that may be, a temple in his honour is built on the hill called Quirinalis after him, and the day on which he vanished is called People’s Flight, and Capratine Nones, because they go out of the city and sacrifice at the Goat’s Marsh; and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Some, however, say that this imitation is not one of flight, but of haste and eagerness, and explain it as referring to the following occasion. After the Gauls had captured Rome and been driven out by Camillus, and when the city was still too weak to recover itself readily, an expedition was made against it by many of the Latins, under the command of Livius Postumius. This general stationed his army not far from Rome, and sent a herald with the message that the Latins wished to renew their ancient relationship and affinity with the Romans, by fresh intermarriages between the two peoples. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>If, therefore, the Romans would send them a goodly number of virgins and their widows, they should have peace and friendship, such as they had formerly made with the Sabines on the like terms. On hearing this message, the Romans hesitated between going to war, which they feared, and the surrender of their women, which they thought no more desirable than to have them captured. But while they were in this perplexity, a serving-maid called Philotis (or, as some say, Tutola) advised them to do neither, but by the use of a stratagem to escape alike the war and the giving of hostages. 
				</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Now the stratagem was this, that they should send to the enemy Philotis herself, and with her other comely serving-maids arrayed like free-born women; then in the night Philotis was to display a signal-fire, at which the Romans were to come in arms and deal with their enemies while asleep. This was done, with the approval of the Latins, and Philotis displayed the signal-fire from a certain wild fig-tree, screening it behind with coverlets and draperies, so that its light was unseen by the enemy, but visible to the Romans.
