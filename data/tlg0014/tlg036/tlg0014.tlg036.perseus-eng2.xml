                <head>A Friend, Pleading for Phormio, A Special Plea</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Phormio’s inexperience in speaking,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This is not merely the conventional plea of inexperience (compare <bibl n="Dem. 34.1">Dem. 34.1</bibl>); Phormio was by now an old man, and further, since he was a manumitted slave, he can have had no training which would equip him for the task, and furthermore, he was, of course, of barbarian birth. His friends, therefore, came to his aid, and one of them speaks in his behalf.</note> and his utter helplessness, you all see for yourselves, men of Athens. It is necessary for us, his friends, to state and set forth for you the facts, which we know full well from having heard him often relate them; in order that, when you have duly learned from us and have come to know the rights of the case, you may give a verdict that is both just and in harmony with your oaths.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>We have put in a special plea in bar of action, not that we may evade the issue and waste time, but that, if the defendant<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The terms <q type="emph">plaintiff</q> and <q type="emph">defendant,</q> as used in the translation of this oration, apply to the suit brought against Phormio.</note> shows that he has committed no wrong whatsoever, he may win in your court an acquittal which will be final. For all that in the minds of other people brings about a firm and lasting settlement without engaging in a trial before you— </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>all this Phormio here has done; he has done many kindnesses to this man Apollodorus; he has duly paid and delivered up to the plaintiff everything belonging to him of which he had been left in control, and has since received a discharge from all further claims; nevertheless, as you see, because Phormio can no longer submit to his demands, Apollodorus has instituted this vexatious and baseless suit for twenty talents. From the beginning, therefore, I shall try to set forth for you as briefly as possible all the transactions Phormio has had with Pasio and Apollodorus. From these, I am sure, the malicious conduct of the plaintiff will become clear to you, and at the same time, having heard this recital, you will determine that the action is not maintainable.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">First the clerk shall read to you the articles of agreement, in accordance with which Pasio leased to the defendant the bank and the shield-factory. Take, please, the articles of agreement, the challenge,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It is not stated precisely what this challenge was; but it may well have been a demand made to Apollodorus to produce the articles in question.</note> and these depositions.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Articles of Agreement. The Challenge. The Depositions</label></p> <p rend="indent">These, men of Athens, are the articles of agreement in accordance with which Pasio leased the bank and the shield-factory to the defendant, after the latter had now become his own master.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">He had been given his freedom by Pasio.</note> But you must hear and understand how it was that Pasio came to owe the eleven talents to the bank.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>He owed that amount, not because of poverty, but because of his thrift.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The word naturally denotes industry, but the clause might possibly be rendered <q type="translation">because he did not wish capital to lie idle</q>; so Dareste. In <bibl n="Dem. 45.33">Dem. 45.33</bibl>, Apollodorus implies that the debt was due to mismanagement on the part of Phormio.</note> For the real property of Pasio was about twenty talents, but in addition to this he had more than fifty talents in money of his own lent<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">As eleven talents of this money belonged to the bank, this phrase is open to question.</note> out at interest. Among these were eleven talents of the bank’s deposits, profitably invested.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>When, therefore, my client leased the business of the bank and took over the deposits, realizing that, if he had not yet obtained the right of citizenship with you, he would be unable to recover the monies which Pasio had lent on the security of land and lodging-houses, he chose to have Pasio himself as debtor for these sums, rather than the others to whom he had lent them. It was for this reason that Pasio was set down as owing eleven talents, as has been stated to you in the depositions.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">In what manner the lease was made, you know from the deposition of the manager of the bank himself. After this, Pasio became ill; and observe how he disposed of his estate. Take the copy of the will, and this challenge, and these depositions made by those in whose custody the will is deposited.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Will. The Challenge. The Depositions</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">When Pasio had died, after making this will, Phormio, the defendant, took his widow to wife in accordance with the terms of the will and undertook the guardianship of his son.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, of Pasicles, who was a minor. That the guardian should marry the widow was a common provision (so in the case of Demosthenes’ own mother; See <bibl n="Dem. 33">Dem. 33</bibl>). In <bibl n="Dem. 45">Dem. 45</bibl> Apollodorus denies that he had been challenged to produce the will, or that he had been left by his father.</note> Inasmuch, however, as the plaintiff was rapacious, and seemed to think it right that he should spend large sums out of the fund which was as yet undivided, the guardians, calculating in their own minds that, if it should be necessary under the terms of the will to deduct from the undivided fund, share for share, an equivalent of what the plaintiff spent, and then distribute the remainder, there would be nothing left to distribute, determined in the interest of the boy to divide the property.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>And they did distribute all the estate except the property on which the defendant had taken a lease; and of the revenue accruing from this they duly paid one-half to the plaintiff. Up to that time, then, how is it possible for him to make complaint regarding the lease? For it is not now that he should show his indignation; he should at once have done so then. Moreover, he cannot say that he has not received the rents which became due subsequently.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>For in that case, when Pasicles came of age and Phormio relinquished the lease, you<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Addressed to the two brothers, Apollodorus and Pasicles.</note> would never have freed him from all claims, but would then instantly have demanded payment, if he had owed you anything.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I speak the truth in this and that the plaintiff did divide the property with his brother, who was still a minor, and that they released Phormio from his liability under the lease and from all other charges, take this deposition.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">As soon, then, as they had released the defendant from the lease, men of Athens, they at once divided between them the bank and the shield-factory, and Apollodorus, having the choice,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">By right of seniority.</note> chose the shield-factory in preference to the bank. Yet, if the plaintiff had any private capital in the bank, why in the world should he have chosen the factory by preference? The income was not greater; nay, it was less (the factory produced a talent, and the bank, one hundred minae); nor was the property more agreeable,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, the conduct of a manufacturing business entailed more labor and trouble than the management of a bank.</note> assuming that he had private capital in the bank. But he had no such capital. So the plaintiff was wise in choosing the factory. For that is a property which involves no risk, while the bank is a business yielding a hazardous revenue from money which belongs to others.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">Many proofs might one advance and set forth to show that the plaintiff’s claim to a sum of banking capital is malicious and baseless. But the strongest proof of all that Phormio received no capital is, I think, this: that Pasio is set down in the lease as debtor to the bank, not as having given banking capital to the defendant. The second proof is that the plaintiff is shown to have made no demands at the time of the distribution of the property. The third is that when he subsequently leased the same business to others for the same sum, he will be shown not to have leased any private capital of his own along with it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>And yet, if he had been defrauded by the defendant of capital which his father left, he would himself on that assumption have had to provide it from some other source and given it to the new lessees.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">If it were true that Apollodorus had been defrauded by Phormio of capital which Pasio had invested in the bank, then, when the bank was let to new lessees on the same terms as before, Apollodorus would have had to make up the missing capital from some other source.</note></p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I speak the truth in this, and that Apollodorus subsequently leased the bank to Xeno and Euphraeus, and Euphro, and Callistratus, and that he delivered no private capital to them either, but that they leased only the deposits and the right to the profits accruing from them, take, please, the deposition which proves these matters, and proves also that he chose the shield-factory.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p rend="indent">Evidence has been submitted to you, men of Athens, that they<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The plural denotes the two brothers, Apollodorus and Pasicles.</note> granted a lease to these men also, and gave over to them no private banking-capital; and that they gave them their freedom,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">These men would appear to have been slaves originally, and, like Phormio himself, were rewarded with emancipation. The alternative rendering, <q type="translation">freed them from all claims,</q> seems less probable.</note> as if having received great benefits from them; and at that time they went to law neither with them nor with Phormio. Indeed, as long as his mother was living, who had an accurate knowledge of all these matters, Apollodorus never made any complaint against Phormio, the defendant; but after her death he brought a malicious and baseless suit claiming three thousand drachmae in money, in addition to two thousand drachmae which she had given to Phormio’s children,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Children, that is, whom she had borne to Phormio.</note> and a bit of underwear and a serving-girl.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Yet even here he will be shown to have said nothing of the claims which he now makes. He referred the matter for arbitration to the father of his own wife, and the husband of his wife’s sister, and to Lysinus and Andromenes,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The two first named represented Apollodorus; the latter two, Phormio.</note> and they induced Phormio to make him a present of the three thousand drachmae and the additional items, and thus to have him as a friend rather than as an enemy because of this. So the plaintiff received in all five thousand drachmae, and going to the temple of Athena,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Parthenon, as it is stated below to have been on the Acropolis.</note> gave Phormio for the second time a release from all demands.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>Yet, as you see, he is suing him again, having trumped up all sorts of accusations, and gathered from all past time charges (and this is the most outrageous thing of all) which he had never made before.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I am speaking the truth in this, take, please, the award that was made in the Acropolis, and the deposition of those who were present, when Apollodorus, on receiving this money, gave a release from all claims.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Award. The Deposition</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p rend="indent">You hear the award, men of the jury, which was rendered by Deinias, whose daughter the plaintiff has married, and Nicias, who is husband to her sister. However, even though he has received this money, and has given a release from all claims, he has the audacity to bring suit for so many talents, just as if all these people were dead, or as if the truth would not be brought to light.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p rend="indent">All the dealings, then, and transactions which Phormio has had with Apollodorus you have heard, men of Athens, from the beginning. But I fancy that Apollodorus, the plaintiff, being unable to advance any just grounds in support of his claim, will repeat what he had the audacity to say before the arbitrator, that his mother made away with the papers at Phormio’s instigation, and that, owing to the loss of these, he has no way of proving his claim strictly.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>But in regard to these statements and this accusation, observe what convincing proofs one could advance to show that he is lying. In the first place, men of Athens, what man would have accepted a distribution of his inheritance, if he had not papers from which he could determine the amount of estate left him? No man, assuredly. Yet it is eighteen years, Apollodorus, since you accepted the distribution, and you cannot show that you at any time made any complaint about the papers.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>In the second place, when Pasicles had come of age, and was receiving the report of his guardians’ administration, what man, even though he shrank from accusing his mother with his own lips of having destroyed the papers, would have failed to reveal the fact to his brother, so that through him it might have been thoroughly investigated? In the third place, what were the papers upon which you based the action which you brought? For the plaintiff has brought suits against many citizens, and has recovered large sums of money, charging in his complaints, <q type="written">So and so has injured me by not paying back to me the money which my father’s papers show he owed the latter at his death.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>But, if the papers had been made away with, on the basis of what papers did he commence his suits?</p> <p rend="indent">In proof that I am speaking the truth in this, you have heard the distribution which he accepted, and the evidence in proof of it has been presented to you. The clerk will now read you the depositions having to do with these actions. Please take the depositions.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p> <p rend="indent">In these complaints, then, he has admitted that he had received his father’s papers; for he surely would not say that he was bringing baseless charges, or that he was suing these men for what they did not owe.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p rend="indent">There are many strong proofs from which one can see that the defendant Phormio is not in the wrong; but the strongest of all, in my opinion, is this: that Pasicles, though he is the brother of Apollodorus, the plaintiff, has neither entered suit nor made any of the charges which the plaintiff makes. But surely the defendant would not have abstained from wronging one who had been left a minor by his father, and over whose property he had control, since he had been left as his guardian, yet would have wronged you, who at your father’s death were left a man of four and twenty, and who on your own behalf would easily and immediately have obtained justice, if any wrong had been done you. That is impossible.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I am speaking the truth in this, and that Pasicles makes no complaint, take, please, the deposition regarding the matter.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p rend="indent">The points which you should now consider in regard to my plea that the action is not admissible, I beg you to recall from what has already been said. We, men of Athens, inasmuch as an accounting had been made and a discharge given from the lease of the bank and of the shield-factory; inasmuch as there had been an arbitrator’s award and again a discharge from all claims; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>inasmuch also as the laws do not allow suits to be brought in cases where a discharge has once been given; and inasmuch as the plaintiff makes a baseless and malicious claim, and brings suit contrary to the laws; we have put in a special plea as allowed by the laws that his suit is not admissible. In order, then, that you may understand the matter regarding which you are going to vote, he shall read you this law and the depositions in sequence of those who were present when Apollodorus discharged Phormio from the lease and from all other claims.</p> <p rend="indent">Take these depositions, please, and the law.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions. The Law</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p rend="indent">You hear the law, men of Athens, stating other cases in which suit may not be brought, and in particular those in which anyone has given a release or discharge.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The two verbs <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφιέναι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαλλάτειν</foreign> seem at times to be virtual synonyms, used freely with the redundancy of legal usage. In some cases, however, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφιέναι</foreign> refers clearly to the creditor’s act, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαλλάτειν</foreign> to the effect on the debtor. Parallel passages are <bibl n="Dem. 37.1">Dem. 37.1</bibl> and <bibl n="Dem. 37.19">Dem. 37.19</bibl>; and <bibl n="Dem. 38.1">Dem. 38.1</bibl>.</note> And with good reason. For if it is just that suit may not be brought again for cases which have once been tried, it is far more just that suit be not allowed for claims in which a discharge has been given. For a man who has lost his suit in your court might perhaps say that you had been deceived; but when a man has plainly decided against himself, by giving a release and discharge, what complaint can he bring against himself that will give him the right to bring suit again regarding the same matters? None whatever, of course. Therefore the man who framed this law placed first among cases in which suit may not be brought all those in which a man has given a release or discharge. Both of these have been given by the plaintiff; for he has released and discharged the defendant. That I am speaking the truth, men of Athens, has been proved to you by the evidence presented.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p rend="indent">Take now, please, the statute of limitations.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Law</label></p> <p rend="indent">The law, men of Athens, has thus clearly defined the time. But this man Apollodorus, when more than twenty years have gone by, demands that you pay more heed to his malicious charges than to the laws in accordance with which you have sworn to give judgement. You should have regard to all the laws, but to this one, men of Athens, above all others.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>For, in my judgement, Solon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It was the custom at Athens to emphasize the sanctity of a given law by attributing its enactment to the great lawgiver, Solon. So, in Sparta, laws were conventionally assumed to have been enacted by Lycurgus.</note> framed it for no other purpose than to prevent your having to be subjected to malicious and baseless actions. For in the case of those who were wronged, he thought that a period of five years was enough to enable them to recover what was their due; while the lapse of time would best serve to convict those who advanced false claims. At the same time, since he realized that neither the contracting parties nor the witnesses would live forever, he put the law in their place, that it might be a witness of truth for those who had no other defence.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p rend="indent">I, for my part, am wondering, men of the jury, what in the world the plaintiff, Apollodorus, will try to say in reply to these arguments. For he can hardly have made this assumption that you, although seeing that he has suffered no wrong financially, will be indignant because Phormio has married his mother. For he is not unaware of this—it is no secret to him or to many of you—that Socrates, the well-known banker, having been set free by his masters just as the plaintiff’s father had been, gave his wife in marriage to Satyrus who had been his slave.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>Another, Socles, who had been in the banking business, gave his wife in marriage to Timodemus, who is still in being and alive, who had been his slave. And it is not here only, men of Athens, that those engaged in this line of business so act; but in Aegina Strymodorus gave his wife in marriage to Hermaeus, his own slave, and again, after her death, gave him his own daughter.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It is probable that the word <q type="mentioned">gave</q> refers to provisions in the will of Strymodorus. We must then assume that the wife died after the will was made, but before the death of Strymodorus. So Sandys.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>And one could mention many other such cases; and no wonder. For although to you, men of Athens, who are citizens by birth, it would be a disgrace to esteem any conceivable amount of wealth above your honorable descent, yet those who obtain citizenship as a gift either from you or from others, and who in the first instance, thanks to this good fortune, were counted worthy of the same privileges, because of their success in money-making, and their possession of more wealth than others, must hold fast to these advantages. So your father Pasio—and he was neither the first nor the last to do this—without bringing disgrace upon himself or upon you, his sons, but seeing that the only protection for his business was that he should bind the defendant to you by a family tie, for this reason gave to him in marriage his own wife, your mother.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>If, then, you examine his conduct in the light of practical utility you will find that he determined wisely; but if from family pride you scorn Phormio as stepfather, see if it be not absurd for you to speak thus. For, if one were to ask you what sort of a man you deem your father to have been, I am sure that you would say, <q type="empg">an honorable man.</q> Now, then, which of you two do you think more resembles Pasio in character and in manner of life, yourself or Phormio? I know well that you think Phormio does. Then do you scorn this man who is more like your father than you are yourself, just because he has married your mother?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>But that this arrangement was made by your father’s grant and solemn injunction may not only be seen from the will, men of Athens, but you yourself, Apollodorus, are a witness to the fact. For when you claimed the right to distribute your mother’s estate share by share—and she had left children by the defendant, Phormio—you then acknowledged that your father had given her with full right, and that she had been married in accordance with the laws. For if Phormio had taken her to wife wrongfully, and no one had given her—then the children were not heirs, and if they were not heirs they had no right of sharing in the property.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Illegitimate children could not inherit; and the fact that Apollodorus recognized the children of Phormio and Archippê as heirs, proves that he admitted the legality of the marriage.</note></p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I am speaking the truth in this evidence has been submitted showing that he received a fourth share<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">There were four children: Apollodorus and Pasicles, and the two born of Phormio and Archippê.</note> and gave a release from all claims.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>Having, then, on no single point, men of Athens, any just claim to advance, he had the audacity to make before the arbitrator the most shameless assertions which it is best that you should hear in advance: first that no will was made at all, but that this is a fiction and forgery from beginning to end; and, secondly, that the reason why he had made all these concessions up to now, and had abstained from going to law, was because Phormio was willing to pay him a large rent, and promised that he would do so. But since he does not do this, now, he says, I go to law.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>But that both of these statements, if he makes them, will be false and inconsistent with his own conduct, pray observe from the following considerations. When he denies the will, ask him this, how it came that he received the lodging-house under the will as being the elder.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A right not often recognized in Attic law. Compare <bibl n="Dem. 39.29">Dem. 39.29</bibl>.</note> He surely will not claim that all the clauses which his father wrote in the will in his favor are valid, and the others invalid.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>And when he says that he was misled by the defendant’s promises, remember that we have brought before you as witnesses those who for a long time, after Phormio had given it up, became lessees under the two brothers of the bank and the shield-factory. And yet it was when he granted the lease to these men, that he should at once have made his charges against the defendant if there were any truth in the claims, for which he then gave a release, but for which he now brings suit against him.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I am speaking the truth that he took the lodging-house under the terms of the will as being the elder, and that he not only thought it right to make no claims against the defendant, but on the contrary praised his conduct, take the deposition.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p rend="indent">That you may know, men of Athens, what large sums he has received from the rents and from the debts<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The debts, that is, due to his father.</note>—he, who will presently wail as though he were destitute and had lost everything—hear a brief account from me. This man has collected twenty talents in all owing to debts he has recovered from the papers which his father left, and of these sums more than half he keeps in his possession; for in many instances he is defrauding his brother of his share.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>From the lessee, for the eight years during which Phormio had the bank, he received eighty minae a year, half of the whole rent. These items make ten talents and forty minae.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The rent of the factory was a talent a year, and that of the bank a talent and forty minae, making a total of one hundred and sixty minae annually, or eighty minae apiece for each of the two brothers, or ten talents and forty minae for the eight-year period.</note> For ten years after that, during which they subsequently leased the bank to Xeno and Euphraeus and Euphro and Callistratus, he received a talent every year.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The rents under the new lease remained the same as before, but Apollodorus received only that from the shield-factory, or a talent annually.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>Besides this he has had for about twenty years the income of the property originally divided, of which he himself had charge, more than thirty minae. If you add all these sums together,—what he got from the distribution, what he recovered from the debts, and what he has collected as rent, it will be plain that he has received more than forty talents, to say nothing of the present Phormio made him, and his inheritance from his mother, and what he has had from the bank and does not pay back—two and one-half talents and six hundred drachmae.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>Ah, but, you will tell us, the state has received these sums, and you have been outrageously treated, having used up your fortune in public services! No; what you expended in public service out of the undivided funds, you and your brother expended jointly; and what you gave after that does not amount to the interest, I will not say on two talents, but even on twenty minae. Do not, then, accuse the state, nor say that the state has received that portion of your patrimony which you have shamefully and wickedly squandered.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p rend="indent">That you may know, men of Athens, the amount of property which he has received, and the public services which he has assumed, the clerk shall read to you the items one by one.</p> <p rend="indent">Please take this list and this challenge and these depositions.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The List. The Challenge. The Depositions</label></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p rend="indent">All these monies he has received; he has debts due him to the value of many talents, which he is collecting, some by voluntary payments, some by bringing action. These debts were owing to Pasio—quite apart from the rent of the bank and the other property which he left;—and these the two brothers have recovered. He has expended upon public services merely what you have heard, the smallest fraction of his income, not to say of his capital; and yet he will assume a bragging air, and will talk about his expenditures for trierarchal and choregic services.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">As a matter of fact Apollodorus had served as trierarch with distinction, and had been most liberal in his expenditures. See <bibl n="Dem. 50.11">Dem. 50.11 ff.</bibl>, and Oration <bibl n="Dem. 45.78">Dem. 45.78</bibl>.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p>I have shown you that these assertions of his will be false; however, even if they should all prove to be true, I think it more honorable and more just that he should continue to render public service from his own funds, than that you should give him the defendant’s property, and while receiving yourselves but a small portion of the whole, should see the defendant reduced to extreme poverty, and the plaintiff in wanton insolence and spending his money in the manner that has been his wont.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Contrast with this passage the statements of Apollodorus himself regarding his manner of life in <bibl n="Dem. 45.77">Dem. 45.77</bibl>.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>With regard now to Phormio’s wealth and his having got it from your father’s estate, and the questions you said you were going to ask as to how Phormio acquired his fortune, you have the least right of any man in the world to speak thus. For Pasio, your father, did not acquire his fortune, any more than Phormio did, by good luck or by inheritance from his father, but he gave proof to the bankers, Antisthenes and Archestratus, who were his masters, that he was a good man and an honest, and so won their confidence.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>It is remarkable what a striking thing it is in the eyes of people who are active in commercial life and in banking, when the same man is accounted industrious and is honest.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The order of the words suggests a slight contrast between <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶναι</foreign>.</note> Well; this quality was not imparted to Pasio by his masters; he was himself honest by nature; nor did your father impart it to Phormio. It was yourself, rather than Phormio, whom he would have made honest, if he had had the power. If you do not know that for money-making the best capital of all is trustworthiness, you do not know anything at all. But, apart from all this, Phormio has in many ways shown himself useful to your father and to you, and in general to your affairs. But your insatiate greed and your character, I take it, no one could adequately express.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>I am surprised that you do not of yourself make this reflection, that Archestratus, to whom your father formerly belonged, has a son here, Antimachus, who fares not at all as he deserves, and who does not go to law with you and say that he is outrageously treated, because you wear a soft mantle, and have redeemed one mistress, and have given another in marriage (all this, while you have a wife of your own), and take three attendant slaves about with you, and live so licentiously that even those who meet you on the street perceive it, while he himself is in great destitution.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p>Nor does he fail to see Phormio’s condition. And yet if on this ground you think you have a claim on Phormio’s property, because he once belonged to your father, Antimachus has a stronger claim than you have. For your father in his turn belonged to those men, so that both you and Phormio by this argument belong to Antimachus. But you are so lost to all proper feeling, that you yourself compel people to say things which you ought to hate anyone for saying.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>You disgrace yourself and your dead parents, and you cast reproach upon the state, and instead of adorning and cherishing this good fortune<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, of course, the right of citizenship.</note> which your father, and afterward Phormio have come to enjoy through the kindness of these men, so that it might have appeared as the highest of honors for those who gave it and for you who obtained it, you drag it into public view, you point the finger of scorn at it, you criticize it; you all but taunt the Athenians for admitting to citizenship a person like yourself.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>Indeed you have come to such a pitch of insanity—what other name can one find for it?—as not to see that at this moment we, who claim that, since Phormio has received his freedom, it should not be remembered against him that he once belonged to your father, are speaking in your interest; while you, in insisting that he should never be on a footing of equality with yourself, are speaking against yourself; for the same rule, which you lay down as just for yourself against Phormio, will be advanced against you by those who at the first were the masters of your father.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that Pasio also was somebody’s slave, and that he afterwards won his freedom in the same manner in which Phormio won his from you, take, please, these depositions, which show that Pasio belonged to Archestratus.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p rend="indent">The man, then, who at the first saved the family fortune, and rendered himself useful in many ways to this man’s father, the man who has conferred upon Apollodorus himself all the benefits of which you have heard, he it is against whom the plaintiff seeks a judgement with such heavy damages, and thinks proper to cast out in ruin contrary to all right. For that, Apollodorus, is all that you could possibly accomplish. For, if you look closely at the property, you will see to whom it belongs, in case—which heaven forbid!—these jurymen are misled by you.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The property of Phormio consisted chiefly in the money of the depositors which he had invested in diverse ways. If heavy damages were assessed against him, the depositors would at once demand their money, and such a run on the bank would be ruinous.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p>Do you see Aristolochus, son of Charidemus? Once he possessed some land; now many people own it; for he acquired it while he was in debt to many. And Sosinomus and Timodemus and the other bankers, who, when they had to settle with their creditors, had to give up all their property. But you think it unnecessary to have regard even for the precautions which your father, a far better man than you and a wiser, took to meet all contingencies.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>He—O Zeus and the gods—esteemed Phormio to be so much more valuable than you both to yourself and to him and to your business, that, although you were a man grown, it was to Phormio, not to you, that he left the control of the leases, and gave him his wife in marriage and honored him as long as he lived. And justly too, men of Athens. For other bankers, who had no rent to pay, but carried on their business on their own account, have all come to ruin; while Phormio, who paid a rent of two talents and forty minae, saved the bank for you.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>For this Pasio was grateful to him, but you make no account of it. Nay, in defiance of the will and the imprecations written in it by your father, you harass him, you prosecute him, you calumniate him. My good sir—you can be addressed by this term—will you not desist, and know this—that to be honest profits more than great wealth? In your own case, at any rate, although, if your words are true, you received all this money, it has all been lost, as you say. But, if you had been a man of character, you would not have squandered it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p rend="indent">For my own part, by Zeus and the gods, though I look at the matter from every side, I can see no reason why the jury should be induced by you to give a verdict against the defendant. Why should they? Because you make your charges so soon after the offence? But you make them years and ages later. Ah, but you avoided the trouble of lawsuits all this time? But who does not know of all the cases in which you have been engaged without ceasing, not only prosecuting private suits of no less importance than the present one, but maliciously trumping up public charges, and bringing men to trial? Did you not accuse Timomachus? Did you not accuse Callippus, who is now in Sicily? Or, again, Meno? or Autocles? or Timotheus? or hosts of others?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Timomachus, Meno, and Autocles (see <bibl n="Dem. 50">Dem 50</bibl>.) were successive commanders of the Athenian fleet in Thracian waters, where Apollodorus served as trierarch. Callippus is all but certainly to be identified with the trierarch of that name, who at the bidding of Timomachus, and after Apollodorus’s own refusal to do so, had transported the exile Callistratus from Macedonia to Thasos. Timotheus was the well-known Athenian general, against whom Apollodorus brought also a private suit to recover funds (<bibl n="Dem. 49">Dem. 49</bibl>).</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>But is it reasonable to believe that you, who are Apollodorus, would deem it your duty to seek satisfaction for public wrongs, which touched you only in part, sooner than for the private wrongs, concerning which you now bring charges, especially when they were as grave as you now claim? Why, then, did you accuse those men, and leave Phormio alone? You were suffering no wrong, but methinks the charges which you are now bringing are baseless and malicious.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p>I think, then, men of Athens, that nothing could be more to the purpose than to bring forward witnesses to these facts. For if one is continually making baseless charges, what can one expect him to do now? In truth, men of Athens, I think that whatever serves as an index of Phormio’s character, and of his uprightness and his generosity, I may rightly bring before you as something quite to the purpose. For one who is dishonest in all matters might perhaps have wronged the plaintiff among others; but a man who has never wronged anybody in anything, but, on the contrary, has voluntarily done good to many, how could he reasonably be thought to have wronged Apollodorus alone of all men?</p> <p rend="indent">When you have heard these depositions, you will know the character of either.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p> </div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p rend="indent">Now read those which bear upon the baseness of Apollodorus.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p> <p rend="indent">Is this fellow of like stamp? Consider. Read on.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p> <p rend="indent">Now read all the services which Phormio has rendered to the state.</p> <p rend="center"><label>Depositions</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p rend="indent">Phormio, then, men of Athens, who has in so many ways proved himself of service to the state and to many of you, and has never done harm to anyone either in public or in private, and who is guilty of no wrong toward this man Apollodorus, begs and implores and claims your protection, and we, his friends, join in the same plea to you. Of another fact, too, you should be informed. Depositions have been read to you, men of Athens, showing that the defendant has supplied you with funds in excess of the whole amount that he or anybody else possesses; but Phormio has credit with those who know him for so great an amount and for far larger sums, and through this he is of service both to himself and to you.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">I follow Sandys in the interpretation of this passage.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>Do not throw this away, nor suffer this abominable fellow to destroy it; do not establish a shameful precedent, that it is permitted by you that rascals and sycophants should take the property of those who are active in business and who lead well-ordered lives. Far greater advantage accrues to you from this wealth while it remains in the possession of the defendant. For you see for yourselves, and you hear from the witnesses, what a friend he shows himself to be to those in need.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p>And not one of these acts has he done with a view to pecuniary advantage, but from generosity and kindliness of disposition. So it is not right, men of Athens, that you should give up such a man to be the prey of Apollodorus. Do not show Phormio pity at a time when it will be of no profit to him, but now when it is in your power to save him; for I see no time in which one could more fittingly come to his aid than now.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>Most of what Apollodorus will say you must regard as mere talk and baseless calumny. Bid him demonstrate to you, either that his father did not make this will, or that there is another lease than the one which we produce; or that he himself after going over the reckoning did not give Phormio a release from all the claims regarding which his father-in-law made the award with the plaintiff’s own concurrence; or that the laws permit one to bring action regarding matters thus decided. Or bid him try to show anything of that sort.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p>But if, for want of proofs, he goes on uttering charges and calumnies and abuse, do not heed him, nor let his noisy talk and shamelessness lead you astray. Nay, keep in mind, and remember all that you have heard. If you do this you will be faithful to your oaths, and will save the defendant, as justice bids. By Zeus and all the gods he deserves it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p rend="indent">Take, and read them the law and these depositions.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Law.
