            <div n="1" type="section">
                <p>It has been conclusively proved, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, that the defendant, Aristogeiton, is a state-debtor and
                    disfranchised, and that the laws expressly forbid all such to address the
                    Assembly. But it is your duty to restrain and check all law-breakers, but
                    especially those who hold office and take part in public affairs, </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
                <p>because such men tend to injure the community, if they are unprincipled, and on
                    the other hand to confer the greatest benefit upon it, if they are honest men
                    and willing to abide by the laws. If you once allow those who administer any
                    part of our public affairs to break the laws and override the established
                    principles of justice, everyone who has a stake in the country is bound to
                    suffer from their wickedness. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
                <p>For just as on a voyage an error committed by a common sailor causes little
                    damage, but, when the helmsman is at fault, he brings disaster on everyone
                    aboard, so the faults of private persons cause loss not so much to the general
                    public as to themselves, while the faults of rulers and statesmen come home to
                    all citizens alike.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
                <p>That was why Solon ordained that the penalties for private citizens should be
                    slow, but for magistrates and political leaders swift, assuming that from the
                    former one can get satisfaction even after some delay, but that one cannot wait
                    for the latter, because there will be no prospect of punishment if the
                    constitution is destroyed. No one will be so impudent or so pretentious that he
                    will attempt to gainsay these principles, except Aristogeiton here with his
                    reckless wickedness. On the contrary we shall find that, when once you have
                    given an adverse verdict, all magistrates and all statesmen accept them. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
                <p>For on the one hand, whenever any officials have been rejected by vote, they
                    instantly cease to hold office and are stripped of their official crowns; and on
                    the other hand, all the judicial archons who are disqualified for promotion to
                    the Areopagus forbear to force their way in and submit humbly to your decision.
                    And this is only reasonable; for just as they believe that private citizens
                    ought to obey them when they are rulers, so when they in their turn descend to
                    the rank of private citizens, they ought to submit to the laws, which are the
                    real rulers of the State. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
                <p>Again, all the statesmen, if you will pass them in review from the earliest
                    times, can be proved to have submitted in the same way to your constitutional
                    decrees. It is said that Aristeides was banished by your ancestors and lived in
                        <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> till the people recalled
                    him, and that Miltiades and Pericles, being fined thirty and fifty talents
                    respectively, did not try to harangue the people until they had paid in full.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="section">
                <p>It would be a most scandalous state of things if, while these men, to whom you
                    were indebted for so many services, were not allowed to do anything contrary to
                    your established laws, this man, who has never done you a single good service,
                    but has committed a prodigious number of offences, should be found to have
                    received at your hands, so readily and so contrary to justice and expediency,
                    the right to transgress the laws. And why appeal to ancient history? Count up
                    the men of your own days and see if anyone has ever been found so shameless. A
                    careful scrutiny will not reveal a single instance. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="section">
                <p>Now apart from all this, whenever a man lodges with the judicial Archons an
                    objection against a decree or law, that law or decree is invalid and the mover
                    or proposer has not the impudence to employ violence, but loyally accepts your
                    decision, even if he is the foremost orator or administrator in your city. Yet
                    is it not absurd that, while decrees passed by you in full assembly as in
                    accordance with the laws should be invalid, you should imagine that you ought to
                    make the whim of Aristogeiton to flout the laws more authoritative than the laws
                    themselves? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="section">
                <p>Again, when a plaintiff fails to obtain a fifth part of the votes, in cases where
                    the laws forbid him henceforward to indict anyone or arrest him or give him into
                    custody, in the same way none of those liable to these disqualifications ever
                    dreams of defying them. But for Aristogeiton, it seems, and for Aristogeiton
                    alone, no court, no law has authority higher than his own caprice. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="section">
                <p>Neither you nor your ancestors ever repented of observing these rules, for it is
                    the salvation of democracy that it overcomes its enemies either by good counsel
                    or by arms, but submits to its laws either by free choice or under constraint;
                    and that this principle is sound, is allowed even by the defendant himself. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="section">
                <p>For after the disasters to the Greek forces at Chaeroneia, when the very
                    foundations of our State were threatened with the utmost danger, when Hypereides
                    proposed that the disfranchised citizens should be reinstated in order that, if
                    any such danger should menace our State, all classes might unite wholeheartedly
                    in the struggle for liberty, the defendant indicted this decree as
                    unconstitutional and conducted his case in court. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="section">
                <p>But is it not monstrous that, where the safety of the State is involved, the
                    defendant should allow none of his fellow-citizens to obtain enfranchisement,
                    but should claim that same favour from you all, in order to cover his own
                    lawlessness? Yet the former vote, Aristogeiton, was far more lawful and
                    equitable than the vote which you now require the jurors to cast in your favour.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="section">
                <p>For the one was fair and equal for all citizens alike, but this is unfair and
                    brings profit to you alone of all the people of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. The first was intended to prevent a peace by which one
                    man would have been put in control of the whole government; the effect of this
                    vote will be that you have received authority to transgress with impunity the
                    decisions of the jury and the laws handed down by our ancestors—to do, in fact,
                    whatever you please. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="14" type="section">
                <p>I should like to ask him whether his indictment of the decree was lawful and
                    right or on the other hand unjust and illegal. For if the indictment was
                    inexpedient and against the interests of the people, on that very ground he
                    richly deserves death; but if it was useful and advantageous to the majority,
                    why, pray, do you now insist on the jury giving a verdict which is contrary to
                    your indictment? No; your proceedings then were unjust and now are neither
                    lawful nor beneficial to the citizens. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="15" type="section">
                <p>I can see that you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    are of this opinion in your own behalf, for you have ere now decided many such
                    “informations” laid against private men. Yet is it not all wrong that in your
                    own case you should so scrupulously examine the laws, but in the case of these
                    mischief-makers, who annoy everyone alike and pretend to be superior to the
                    rest, you should display such indifference? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="section">
                <p>It is impossible that any of you are of opinion that things ought to be as I say,
                    but that, because of the decorous behavior of Aristogeiton and his usefulness to
                    you, you ought to wink even at his violation of the laws. I think Lycurgus in
                    his speech has satisfactorily proved that the defendant is an unscrupulous man
                    and has an extraordinary faculty for injustice; and that he is not a useful
                    citizen, anyone can see from his public performances. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="17" type="section">
                <p>For whom has he brought into court that he succeeded in convicting on the charges
                    that he laid against him? Or what source of revenue has he provided for you? Or
                    what decree has he ever drafted that you were not afterwards glad to disown? The
                    truth is, he is so tactless, so un-Greek in his temperament, that when he sees
                    you somewhat angry with anyone and rather more exasperated than the occasion
                    calls for, he at once anticipates your wishes in the moment of your wrath and so
                    opposes your interests. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="18" type="section">
                <p>But a statesman, acting on your behalf, ought not to follow up the hasty
                    sentiments that accompany your anger, but should be guided by reasons, by
                    events, by the opportunities that present themselves. For sentiments are wont to
                    change quickly, but reasons to subsist for a longer period. Paying no regard to
                    this the defendant detects the secret weakness of community, so that the same
                    policy is bound to be ratified one day and repealed the next. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="19" type="section">
                <p>But perhaps because the role he adopts is to rail at everyone, to shout people
                    down and find fault with their speeches, therefore it is convenient in these
                    times to protect him. Gentlemen of the jury, I swear by the goddess of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> that what takes place on
                    the hustings is a disgrace to our city, and it is through the recklessness of
                    such speakers that political life is now discredited with all decent citizens.
                    But if any of you happen to like that sort of thing, you will never want for
                    such performers. Why, even now the platform swarms with them. For to pick holes
                    in the counsel offered is not difficult, but it is difficult to advise you and
                    persuade you to pass any indispensable resolution. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="20" type="section">
                <p>Furthermore, if he had not already deceived you by using these same arguments,
                    when he was on trial at the earlier information, even so it would not be just to
                    make any concession contrary to the existing laws; for you must not allow some
                    persons to break the law and insist on the rest obeying it. Yet just possibly it
                    might then have been more reasonable to trust him and grant him privileges and
                    sacrifice some of these principles. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="21" type="section">
                <p>But after you had let him off, admittedly in hope of amendment, and then shortly
                    after had to punish the same man again for speaking and acting against the best
                    interests of the city, what reasonable excuse is left you if you are a second
                    time hoodwinked? When you have tried him by deeds, why need you trust his words?
                    In cases where you have not yet an accurate test ready to hand, it may perhaps
                    be necessary to judge by words. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="22" type="section">
                <p>But, for myself, I am amazed that there are men so constituted that, though they
                    deposit private property with those only whose past record shows them to be
                    honest, they entrust public affairs to men who have been admittedly proved
                    unscrupulous. No one would dream of setting a sorry mongrel to guard a flock;
                    yet some people say that, to keep watch on those who administer the State, one
                    need only employ the first comers, men who pretend to detect delinquents, but
                    need the most careful watching themselves. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="23" type="section">
                <p>If you are wise, you will bear this in mind. Turn a deaf ear to those who profess
                    to be devoted to you, and take your own precautions to ensure that you grant to
                    no one the power to make your laws null and void, especially to no one of those
                    who pretend to be able to speak and legislate in the interests of the masses. It
                    is preposterous that your ancestors faced death to save the laws from
                    destruction, but that you do not even punish those who have offended against the
                    laws; that you set up in the market-place a bronze statue of Solon, who framed
                    the laws, but show yourselves regardless of those very laws for the sake of
                    which he has received such exceptional honor. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="24" type="section">
                <p>Is it not an absurd situation that you should by legislating express your anger
                    against the criminals, but, when you have caught any of them red-handed, should
                    proceed to let them go unscathed? That the lawgiver, a single individual, should
                    on your behalf incur the hostility of all the worthless, but that you
                    yourselves, collected together to defend your own interests, should not even
                    display your hatred of the wicked, but should be overpowered by the wickedness
                    of a single individual? That you should have fixed death as the penalty if
                    anyone cites a law which does not exist, and yet should allow men to escape
                    unpunished who reduce the existing laws to the level of laws which do not exist?

                <p>The surest way to realize the blessing of obedience to the established laws, and
                    the curse of despising and disobeying them, is to put before your eyes and
                    examine separately the advantages that you derive from the laws and the results
                    of lawlessness. For you will find that the fruits of lawlessness are madness,
                    intemperance and greed, but from the laws come wisdom, sobriety and justice.

                <p>This is clearly so, because we can see that those cities are best ordered which
                    have given birth to the best lawgivers. For as the distempers of the body are
                    arrested by the discoveries of physicians, so savagery is expelled from the soul
                    by the wise purposes of the legislator. To sum up we shall find nothing
                    venerable or admirable which is not associated with law, </p>

                <p>since the whole round world, the heavenly bodies and what we call the seasons are
                    plainly, if we can trust our senses, controlled by law and order. Therefore, men
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, exhort one another to
                    come to the rescue of the laws, and cast your votes against those who
                    deliberately dishonor what is divine; and if you do this, you will be doing your
                    duty and making the best use of your votes.</p>
