                <p>In suits of this nature, men of the jury, it is fitting that those who are to
                    render a decision, as well as the litigants themselves, should give the closest
                    attention. For the suit is not a private one concerning Polycles and myself
                    alone, but it touches also the interests of the state as well. In cases where
                    the charges indeed are of a private nature, but the injury is public, it is
                    surely fitting that you should listen and decide aright. If I had come before
                    you quarrelling with Polycles about a contract of some other sort, the contest
                    would have concerned Polycles and myself alone; but as it is, the question
                    concerns the succession to a ship, and extra trierarchal expenses for five
                    months and six days, and it concerns also the laws, whether they are to be in
                    force, or not. </p>

                <p>It seems to me, therefore, to be necessary to explain all the facts to you from
                    the beginning. And by the gods, men of the jury, I beg you not to think that I
                    am talking idly, if I set forth at some length what I have expended and what I
                    have done, to show that my several services were rendered opportunely, and that
                    they were helpful to the state. If anyone is able to show that I am uttering
                    falsehoods, let him get up in the time allotted to me and disprove whatever
                    statement I may make to you which he holds to be false. But if my statements are
                    true, and no one would contradict them save the defendant, I make of you all a

                    and shipowners were about to sail out of the Pontus, and the Byzantines and

                    seeing also that the price of grain was advancing in the Peiraeus, and that
                    there was not very much to be bought, you voted that the trierarchs should
                    launch their ships and bring them up to the pier, and that the members of the
                    senate and the demarchs should make out lists of the demesmen and reports of
                    available seamen, and that the armament should be despatched at once, and aid
                    sent to the various regions. And this decree, proposed by Aristophon, was
                    passed, as follows:<quote type="Decree">

                <p>The decree, then, you have heard, men of the jury. For my own part, when the
                    sailors listed by the demesmen did not appear, save a very few, and these
                    incompetent, I dismissed them; and having mortgaged my property and borrowed
                    money, I was the first to man my ship, hiring the best sailors possible by
                    giving to each man large bonuses and advance payments. More than that, I
                    furnished the ship with equipment wholly my own, taking nothing from the public
                    stores, and I made everything as beautiful and magnificent as possible, outdoing
                    all the other trierarchs. As for rowers, I hired the best that could be had.

                <p>And not only did I defray the trierarchal expenses, which at that time were so
                    very heavy, but I also paid in advance no small part of the taxes which you had
                    ordered to be collected for the cost of the expedition. For when you had voted
                    that the members of the senate on behalf of the demesmen should report the names
                    of those who were to pay taxes in advance, both of those who were members of the
                    demes and those who owned property in them, my name was reported from three

                    defray the costs of two public services at once, or that the laws did not permit
                    such a thing. And I have never recovered the money which I advanced, because at
                    the time I was abroad in your service as trierarch, and afterwards, when I
                    returned, I found that the money from those who had resources had already been
                    gathered in by others, and that those who were left had nothing. </p>

                    end that from this evidence you may know how generous I was and why the
                    defendant was unwilling to take over the ship from me when the term of my

                <p>The proof, then, that I am uttering no falsehoods in regard to the matters which
                    I have mentioned, you have learned, men of the jury, from the reading of the
                    depositions. But, further, you will all agree with me that what I am about to
                    say is true. It is admitted that the usefulness of a ship is done away with,
                    first, if the men are not paid, and secondly, if she put into the Peiraeus
                    before her expedition is finished; for in that case there is a great deal of
                    desertion, and those of the sailors who remain are unwilling to embark again,
                    unless additional money is given them for their household expenses. Both of
                    these things happened to me, men of the jury, so that my trierarchy became the
                    more costly. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="12">
                <p>For I received no pay from the general for the space of eight months, and I
                    sailed home to Peiraeus with the ambassadors because my ship was the fastest
                    sailer, and again, when I was ordered by the people to take Menon the general to
                    the Hellespont to replace Autocles, who had been removed from his command, I set
                    sail on short notice from Athens. In the place of the seamen who had deserted I
                    hired others, giving them large bonuses and advance payments, and I gave to
                    those of the original sailors who stayed with me something to leave behind for
                    the maintenance of their households in addition to what they had before; </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="13">
                <p>for I was well aware of the need they felt, and how it pressed upon each one, and
                    I was myself embarrassed for funds as, by Zeus and Apollo, no one could believe,
                    who had not accurately followed the course of my affairs. However, I mortgaged
                    my farm to Thrasylochus and Archeneüs, and having borrowed thirty minae from
                    them and distributed the money among the crew, I put to sea, that no part of the
                    people's orders might fail to be carried out, as far as it depended on me. And
                    the people, hearing of this, gave me a vote of thanks, and invited me to dine in
                    the Prytaneum.To prove that I am speaking the truth in this, the clerk shall
                    read you the deposition dealing with these facts, and the decree of the
                        people.<quote type="Deposition">

                    they knew that the term of my trierarchy had expired and that their voyage was
                    not to be homeward and that no successor had arrived to take command from whom
                    they could expect any relief. For the more ambitious I had been to man my ship

                    since the term of my trierarchy had expired, and I secured also some other

                    arrived to take over the ship. The general, Timomachus, however,—for an embassy
                    from the Maronites had come to him, begging him to convoy their grain
                    ships—ordered us trierarchs to make cables fast to the ships and tow them to
                    Maroneia—a long voyage across the open sea. </p>

                    my service as trierarch has been to me, and all the expenses which I
                    subsequently bore in the interest of the defendant by serving beyond my term,
                    since he did not come to take over the ship, and all the dangers I myself
                    incurred from storms and from the enemy. For after we had convoyed the ships to
                    Maroneia, and had arrived at Thasos, Timomachus came and undertook again in
                    conjunction with the Thasians to convoy grain and a body of peltasts<note

                    and offered battle, and our men were tired out with their long voyage and from
                    towing the ships from Thasos to Strymê besides, it was stormy, and the place
                    offered no harbor, and it was impossible to go ashore and get a meal, for the
                    country was hostile, and all around the wall bands of mercenaries and barbarians
                    from the neighborhood lay encamped; so we were forced to ride at anchor all
                    night long in the open sea without food and without sleep, keeping watch lest
                    the ships of the Maronites should attack us in the night. </p>

                    again to face after this? For the old sailors had borne many hardships and
                    received but little compensation—merely what I was able to borrow and give to
                    each man in addition to what they had had from me before, since the general did
                    not supply enough even for their daily sustenance. By now I had served three
                    months beyond my term, and the defendant had not yet come to take over the ship;
                    but I borrowed money and hired sailors to replace those who had deserted. </p>

                    Hellespont on account of his sickness, when he reached port and heard that

                    set sail and take over the ship with all speed, telling him that the expenses
                    which were incurred every day in addition to the provision money supplied by the

                    on board subsequently to replace those who had deserted, and also of the
                    additional sums which I had given to each of the old sailors at their request
                    after the term of my trierarchy had expired, and all the rest of the money
                    expended upon the ship from day to day. With all these matters Euctemon was
                    thoroughly acquainted, for it was through him as pentecontarch that all
                    purchases and disbursements were made. </p>

                    agreement with him, or sail from here taking your own equipment with you. I
                    think, however,” he added, “that he will readily come to terms with you; for he
                    owes money there, which he will be glad to pay from the price of the equipment.”
                    When the defendant heard these words from Euctemon and Deinias my father-in-law,
                    he made no answer to them regarding the matters of which they spoke but, they
                    said, he broke into a laugh, and said, “The mouse has just tasted pitch<note

                    by paying Archeneüs and Thrasylochus thirty minae. Regarding the wear and tear
                    of the ship's equipment they were willing to draw up an agreement with him, and

                <p>There are many proofs from which I think I can show you that Polycles neither at
                    the first intended to take over the ship from me, nor, after he was forced by
                    you and your decree to go and join the ship, was he willing to take it over as
                    my successor. For after he arrived at Thasos, when I was serving for the fourth
                    month after my term had expired, I took witnesses with me, as many of the
                    citizens as I could and the marines and rowers, and, coming up to him in the
                    market-place at Thasos, I bade him take over the ship from me as my successor
                    and repay me what I had expended since the expiration of my term. </p>

                <p>I was ready to reckon it up item by item, while I had by me as witnesses to the

                    disputed anything, I might refute him at once. Everything had been recorded so
                    accurately by me, that I had written down not only the disbursements themselves,
                    but also the objects for which the money had been spent, the nature of the
                    service rendered, what the price was, in the coinage of what country the payment
                    was made, and what the loss in exchange was, in order that I might be able to
                    give convincing proof to my successor, if he thought any false entries were
                    being made against him. </p>

                    this point a servant came from the general with orders for me to set sail. The
                    order was given to me, not to the defendant, my successor, upon whom the duty
                    was now devolving; but the reason for this I will explain in the course of my
                    address. For the time being it seemed to me best to weigh anchor and sail where

                    remain on board, I went by myself to the house where the general, Timomachus,
                    lodged, wishing that he too should be present, when I offered the ship with her
                    full crew to the defendant Polycles. </p>

                <p>I found the defendant there and the trierarchs and those who were to succeed

                    Polycles in the presence of the general, and called upon him to take over the
                    ship from me, and to pay me for the disbursements made during the period since
                    my term of service had expired; and I asked him about the ship's equipment,
                    whether he would take it over, or whether he had brought equipment of his own
                    with him. </p>

                    some people able to provide equipment for their ships, so that the state itself
                    did not need to do it. “Or have you,” he said, “so far surpassed the others in
                    wealth as to be the only one of the trierarchs to have equipment of your own and
                    gilded ornaments? </p>

                    services normally required on board a ship, and able also to make use of the
                    baths, and marines and rowers rendered luxurious by high wages paid in full? Bad
                    ways,” he said, “are these you have taught the army. It is partly your fault
                    that the troops of the other trierarchs have become more unruly, seeking to have
                    the same treatment that yours enjoy; you ought to have done the same as the

            <div type="section" n="36">
                <p>Upon his saying this, I answered that the reason I had taken no equipment from
                    the docks was because, “You,” said I, “have brought the stores into bad repute.
                    However, if you like, take this equipment of mine; if not, provide equipment for
                    yourself. As for the sailors and marines and rowers, if you say that they have
                    been corrupted by me, take over the ship, and get sailors and marines and rowers
                    for yourself, who will sail with you without pay. But take over the ship, for it
                    is not my place to serve any longer; the term of my trierarchy has expired, and

                    that I am telling you the truth in this, that in the market-place he made the
                    answer mentioned above, that he cared nothing for what I was saying, and that in

                <p>Perhaps, now, men of the jury, you want to hear for what possible reason the
                    general failed to compel the defendant to take over the ship, when he came to it
                    as my successor, the laws on the matter being so strict. In regard to this I
                    wish to show you clearly why it was. For Timomachus, men of the jury, wished
                    above all things to have the trireme well equipped for every service. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="44">
                <p>He knew, however, that the defendant, if he took over the ship, would manage
                    wretchedly as trierarch; that he would get service neither from the crew nor the
                    marines nor the rowers, for not one of them would stay with him. Besides, he
                    knew that, if he ordered him to sail without giving him money, he would not put
                    out to sea at his bidding, as I should do, but would make trouble. And in
                    addition to this he borrowed from him thirty minae on the understanding that he
                    would not force him to take over the ship. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="45">
                <p>But why it was that he was especially incensed against me and treated me
                    despitefully, and would never on any occasion listen to a word from me regarding
                    any matter, I wish to show you clearly, that you may understand that I cared
                    less at that time for my own comfort or for the general's power than for the
                    people of Athens and the laws, and that I endured ill-treatment and abuse, which
                    were far more grievous to me than the expenses I incurred. </p>

                <p>For, while the fleet was lying at Thasos, a despatch-boat came from Methonê in
                    Macedonia to Thasos, bringing a man with letters from Callistratus to
                    Timomachus, which, as I afterward learned, contained a request that he should
                    send the swiftest-sailing ship he had to bring Callistratus to him. At once,
                    then, at daybreak the next morning, the officer from the general came and
                    ordered me to summon my crew to the ship. </p>

                    and ordered the pilot to steer the course for Macedonia. When we had reached a
                    place on the opposite mainland, a trading post of the Thasians, and had gone
                    ashore and were getting our dinner, one of the sailors, Callicles, the son of
                    Epitrephes, of Thria,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Thria, a deme of the
                        tribe Oeneïs</note> came up to me, and said that he wished to speak to me
                    about a matter which concerned myself. I bade him speak on, and he said that he
                    wanted to make what return he could for the help I had given him in his need.

                <p>“Do you know, then,” he asked, “for what purpose you are making this voyage, and
                    where you are going?” When I replied that I did not know, he said, “Then I will
                    tell you; for you must learn this in order to plan your action aright. You are
                    going,” said he, “to bring Callistratus, an exile whom the Athenians have twice
                    condemned to death, from Methonê to Thasos to Timomachus, his kinsman by
                    marriage. I have found this out,” he said, “from the servants of Callippus. For
                    your own part, then, if you are wise, you will not permit any exile to come on
                    board the ship; for the laws forbid it.” </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="49">
                <p>On hearing this from Callicles, I approached Callippus, and asked him to what
                    place he was sailing, and whom he was going to fetch. He spoke roughly to me and
                    threatened me in a way you can easily understand (for you are not without
                    experience of the ways of Callippus), and I said to him, “I hear that you are
                    sailing to fetch Callistratus. Now, I will transport no exile, nor will I go to
                    fetch him; for the laws forbid anyone to give harborage to any exile, and make
                    one who does so liable to the same punishment. I shall, therefore, sail back to
                    the general in Thasos.” </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="50">
                <p>So, when the sailors came on board, I ordered the pilot to sail back to Thasos.
                    Callippus protested, and bade him sail for Macedonia in accordance with the
                    general's commands; but Posidippus, the pilot, answered him that I was trierarch
                    of the ship, and the one responsible, and that he got his pay from me; he would
                    sail, therefore, whither I bade him sail—to Thasos, to the general. </p>

            <div type="section" n="51">
                <p>When we reached Thasos the next day, Timomachus sent for me to come to the place
                    where he lodged outside the wall. I was afraid that he would put me under arrest
                    on false charges preferred by Callippus, so did not obey the summons in person,
                    but told the officer that, if he had anything to say to me, I should be in the
                    market-place; and I sent my servant with him, in order that, if the general had
                    any orders to give he might hear and report to me. </p>

                <p>It was for this reason, which I have stated to you, men of the jury, that
                    Timomachus did not force the defendant to take over the ship, and besides, he
                    wanted the use of the ship for himself, as she was the best sailer. As for the
                    trireme of Thrasylochus of Anagyrus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Anagyrus,
                        a deme of the tribe Erectheïs.</note> on board which he was himself sailing,
                    he induced Thrasylochus to let his trierarchy to Callippus, that Callippus,
                    being in full control of the ship, might carry Callistratus about, as he
                    pleased. Timomachus himself came on board my ship, and sailed around here and
                    there until he reached the Hellespont. </p>

                    furnishing no money for sustenance to the sailors (he said he had none, but
                    should get some from Mytilenê), and the men had nothing with which to buy
                    provisions, and without food could not have continued rowing, </p>

                    for the expenses I had incurred while I serving as trierarch in his stead beyond
                    my term. I did this in order that he might not make use of the pretext, in his
                    defence before you, that I refused to hand over the ship to him because I was
                    ambitious to sail home in a fast-sailing ship and show off to you my lavish

                    ship from me, or not. On his replying that he had brought money with him, I
                    urged him to lend me some on the security of the ship's equipment, that I might
                    distribute it among the sailors and bring the ship home, seeing that he refused
                    to take over the ship, although he was my successor.</p>

                    Tenedos, and gave the sailors their provision-money; for on account of my being
                    Pasion's son, and the fact that he was connected by ties of hospitality with
                    many, and was trusted throughout the Greek world, I had no difficulty in

                    period during which I served as trierarch beyond my term on the defendant's
                    behalf, and the sums which the several deserters took with them when they ran
                    away from the ship, and where they went, in order that you may be assured that
                    neither now nor at any time before have I made false statements to you. I count
                    it my duty to serve you in a manner above reproach for the period prescribed by
                    law, and as regards those who scorn you and the laws, and will not obey the
                    laws, to convict them and get them punished in your courts. </p>

                <p>Be assured that it will be no more in my interest than in your own that you will
                    punish Polycles, nor will you be showing concern merely for those who have
                    served as trierarchs in the past; no, you will be taking thought also for those
                    who are to serve in the future, so that those who perform public services may
                    not be discouraged, and those who are designated as their successors may not
                    show contempt toward the laws, but may go to their ships when they are
                    appointed. These matters you should bear in mind, and reach a fair and just
                    decision regarding all the points at issue. </p>

                <p>I should gladly ask you, men of the jury, what opinion you would have had of me,
                    if, when my term of service had expired and the defendant had not come to take
                    over the ship, I had refused to serve longer when the general so ordered, but
                    had sailed away. Would you not have been indignant and have thought that I was
                    wronging you? If, then, you would have been indignant in that case, because I
                    refused to serve beyond my term, should you not now exact from the defendant the
                    money expended by me on his behalf, seeing that he did not take over the ship?

                <p>To prove that it is not in my case only that he failed to take over his ship, but
                    that on a former occasion also, when he was the associate of Euripides in the
                    trierarchy and there was an agreement between them that each should sail for six
                    months, when Euripides had sailed and the term had expired, Polycles did not
                    take over the ship from him,—to prove this, I say, the clerk shall read the
                        deposition.<quote type="Deposition">
