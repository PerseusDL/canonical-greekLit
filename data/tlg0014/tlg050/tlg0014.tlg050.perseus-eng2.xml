                <head>Apollodorus Against Polycles for Expenses Incurred while Serving as Trierarch beyond the Appointed Time</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">In suits of this nature, men of the jury, it is fitting that those who are to render a decision, as well as the litigants themselves, should give the closest attention. For the suit is not a private one concerning Polycles and myself alone, but it touches also the interests of the state as well. In cases where the charges indeed are of a private nature, but the injury is public, it is surely fitting that you should listen and decide aright. If I had come before you quarrelling with Polycles about a contract of some other sort, the contest would have concerned Polycles and myself alone; but as it is, the question concerns the succession to a ship, and extra trierarchal expenses for five months and six days, and it concerns also the laws, whether they are to be in force, or not.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>It seems to me, therefore, to be necessary to explain all the facts to you from the beginning. And by the gods, men of the jury, I beg you not to think that I am talking idly, if I set forth at some length what I have expended and what I have done, to show that my several services were rendered opportunely, and that they were helpful to the state. If anyone is able to show that I am uttering falsehoods, let him get up in the time allotted to me and disprove whatever statement I may make to you which he holds to be false. But if my statements are true, and no one would contradict them save the defendant, I make of you all a request that is fair.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>All you who were in the army and were present in the campaign, call to mind and tell to those who sit by you my own efforts and the troubles and distresses in which the state was involved at that crisis, in order that you may know from this evidence what manner of man I am in carrying out the orders you lay upon me. And all of you who stayed at home, listen to me in silence, while I set forth before you all the facts, and produce in support of every statement that I make the laws and decrees both of the senate and the people, and the testimony of witnesses.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">On the twenty-fourth day of the month Metageitnion<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Metageitnion corresponds to the latter half of August and the prior half of September.</note> in the archonship of Molon,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The archonship of Molon falls in <date when="-0362">362</date> B.C.</note> when an assembly had been held and tidings of many serious events had been brought before you, you voted that the trierarchs (of whom I was one) should launch their ships. It is not necessary for me to go into details regarding the crisis which had at that time befallen the state; you of yourselves know that Tenos<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Tenos, one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea, had been captured by the fleet on Alexander of Pherae, who at this time was master of Thessaly.</note> had been seized by Alexander, and its people had been reduced to slavery; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>that Miltocythes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Miltocythes was a vassal of Cotys, king of the Odrysae in Thrace, a former friend, but now an enemy of Athens.</note> had revolted from Cotys, and had sent ambassadors regarding an alliance, begging you to send troops to his aid, and offering to restore the Chersonesus; that the Proconnesians,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Proconnesus, an island on the Propontis (Sea of Marmora).</note> your allies, were requesting you in the assembly to come to their aid, stating that the Cyzicenes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cyzicus, a town on the southern shore of the Propontis.</note> were pressing them hard in war by both land and sea, and imploring you not to look idly on while they perished.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>When you heard all these tidings at that time in the assembly from both the speakers themselves and those who supported them; when furthermore the merchants and shipowners were about to sail out of the Pontus, and the Byzantines and Calchedonians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Calchedon, a town across the Bosporus from Byzantium.</note> and Cyzicenes were forcing their ships to put in to their ports because of the scarcity of grain in their own countries; seeing also that the price of grain was advancing in the Peiraeus, and that there was not very much to be bought, you voted that the trierarchs should launch their ships and bring them up to the pier, and that the members of the senate and the demarchs should make out lists of the demesmen and reports of available seamen, and that the armament should be despatched at once, and aid sent to the various regions. And this decree, proposed by Aristophon, was passed, as follows:</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Decree</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">The decree, then, you have heard, men of the jury. For my own part, when the sailors listed by the demesmen did not appear, save a very few, and these incompetent, I dismissed them; and having mortgaged my property and borrowed money, I was the first to man my ship, hiring the best sailors possible by giving to each man large bonuses and advance payments. More than that, I furnished the ship with equipment wholly my own, taking nothing from the public stores, and I made everything as beautiful and magnificent as possible, outdoing all the other trierarchs. As for rowers, I hired the best that could be had.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And not only did I defray the trierarchal expenses, which at that time were so very heavy, but I also paid in advance no small part of the taxes which you had ordered to be collected for the cost of the expedition. For when you had voted that the members of the senate on behalf of the demesmen should report the names of those who were to pay taxes in advance, both of those who were members of the demes and those who owned property in them, my name was reported from three demes, as my property was in land.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Of these I was the first to pay my taxes in advance, nor did I seek to get myself excused either on the ground that I was serving as trierarch and could not defray the costs of two public services at once, or that the laws did not permit such a thing. And I have never recovered the money which I advanced, because at the time I was abroad in your service as trierarch, and afterwards, when I returned, I found that the money from those who had resources had already been gathered in by others, and that those who were left had nothing.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">To prove that I am stating the truth to you in this, the clerk shall read you the depositions covering these matters, those of the persons who at that time collected the military supplies and of the despatching board; also the record of the pay which I gave out every month to the rowers and the marines, receiving from the generals subsistence-money alone, except pay for two months only in a period of a year and five months also a list of the sailors who were hired, and how much money each of them received; to the end that from this evidence you may know how generous I was and why the defendant was unwilling to take over the ship from me when the term of my trierarchy had expired.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">The proof, then, that I am uttering no falsehoods in regard to the matters which I have mentioned, you have learned, men of the jury, from the reading of the depositions. But, further, you will all agree with me that what I am about to say is true. It is admitted that the usefulness of a ship is done away with, first, if the men are not paid, and secondly, if she put into the Peiraeus before her expedition is finished; for in that case there is a great deal of desertion, and those of the sailors who remain are unwilling to embark again, unless additional money is given them for their household expenses. Both of these things happened to me, men of the jury, so that my trierarchy became the more costly.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>For I received no pay from the general for the space of eight months, and I sailed home to Peiraeus with the ambassadors because my ship was the fastest sailer, and again, when I was ordered by the people to take Menon the general to the Hellespont to replace Autocles, who had been removed from his command, I set sail on short notice from Athens. In the place of the seamen who had deserted I hired others, giving them large bonuses and advance payments, and I gave to those of the original sailors who stayed with me something to leave behind for the maintenance of their households in addition to what they had before; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>for I was well aware of the need they felt, and how it pressed upon each one, and I was myself embarrassed for funds as, by Zeus and Apollo, no one could believe, who had not accurately followed the course of my affairs. However, I mortgaged my farm to Thrasylochus and Archeneüs, and having borrowed thirty minae from them and distributed the money among the crew, I put to sea, that no part of the people’s orders might fail to be carried out, as far as it depended on me. And the people, hearing of this, gave me a vote of thanks, and invited me to dine in the Prytaneum.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I am speaking the truth in this, the clerk shall read you the deposition dealing with these facts, and the decree of the people.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition. The Decree</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p rend="indent">Then, when we came to the Hellespont, and the term of my trierarchy had expired, and no pay had been given to the soldiers except for two months when another general, Timomachus, had come—though even he brought to the fleet no new trierarchs to relieve those in service,—many of my crew became discouraged and went off, deserting the ship, some to the mainland to take military service, and some to the fleet of the Thasians,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Thasos, a large island in the nothern Aegean.</note> and Maronites,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Maroneia, a town on the southern coast of Thrace.</note> won over by the promise of high pay and receiving substantial sums in advance.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>They saw also that my resources were by now exhausted, that the state was neglectful of them, that our allies were in need, and the generals not to be depended on, and that they had been deceived by the words of many of them; and they knew that the term of my trierarchy had expired and that their voyage was not to be homeward and that no successor had arrived to take command from whom they could expect any relief. For the more ambitious I had been to man my ship with good rowers, by so much was the desertion from me greater than from the other trierarchs.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>For the others had this advantage at any rate, that the sailors who had come to their ships drawn from the official lists, stayed with them in order to make sure of their return home when the general should discharge them; whereas mine, trusting in their skill as able rowers, went off wherever they were likely to be re-employed at the highest wages, thinking more of their gain for the immediate present than of the danger impending over them, if they should ever be caught by me.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p rend="indent">Consequently when my affairs were in the condition which I have described, and at the same time I was ordered by the general, Timomachus, to sail to Hieron<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Hieron was on the eastern shore of the Cimmerian Bosporus (the straight between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azof).</note> to convoy the grain, though he provided no pay (word had been brought that the Byzantines and the Calchedonians were again bringing the ships into port and forcing them to unload their grain), I borrowed money from Archidemus of Anaphlystus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Anaphlystus, a deme of the tribe Antiochis.</note> fifteen minae at interest, and I secured from Nicippus, the shipowner, who happened to be in Sestus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Sestus, also a town on the Hellespont.</note> eight hundred drachmae, as a maritime loan at 12 1/2 per cent, on condition that I should pay him principal and interest when the ship should get safely back to Athens.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>Further, I sent Euctemon, the pentecontarch,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> The pentecontarch was properly an under-officer in charge of a tier of fifty oarsmen.</note> to Lampsacus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Lampsacus, a town on the Hellespont.</note> giving him money and letters to friends of my father, and bade him hire for me the best sailors he could. I myself stayed in Sestus and gave some money—all I had—to the old sailors who stayed with me, since the term of my trierarchy had expired, and I secured also some other sailors at full pay, while the general was making ready for his voyage to Hieron.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>But when Euctemon came back from Lampsacus, bringing the sailors whom he had hired, and the general gave the word for us to put to sea, it happened that Euctemon suddenly fell sick, and was in a very serious condition. I, therefore, gave him his pay, adding money for his journey, and sent him home; while I secured another pentecontarch and put out to sea to convoy the grain, and I stayed there forty-five days, until the vessels sailed out from Pontus after the rising of Arcturus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The rising of Arcturus falls at the time of the autumnal equinox.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>When I arrived at Sestus, I expected to sail for home, as my term of service had expired, and I had already served two months beyond it and no successor had arrived to take over the ship. The general, Timomachus, however,—for an embassy from the Maronites had come to him, begging him to convoy their grain ships—ordered us trierarchs to make cables fast to the ships and tow them to Maroneia—a long voyage across the open sea.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p rend="indent">I have told all these facts to you from the beginning, that you may know how much I have myself expended and how burdensome my service as trierarch has been to me, and all the expenses which I subsequently bore in the interest of the defendant by serving beyond my term, since he did not come to take over the ship, and all the dangers I myself incurred from storms and from the enemy. For after we had convoyed the ships to Maroneia, and had arrived at Thasos, Timomachus came and undertook again in conjunction with the Thasians to convoy grain and a body of peltasts<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Light-armed troops.</note> to Strymê,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Stryme, a town on the southern coast of Thrace.</note> with the intention of taking the place himself.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>However, the Maronites arrayed their ships against us in defence of the place, and offered battle, and our men were tired out with their long voyage and from towing the ships from Thasos to Strymê besides, it was stormy, and the place offered no harbor, and it was impossible to go ashore and get a meal, for the country was hostile, and all around the wall bands of mercenaries and barbarians from the neighborhood lay encamped; so we were forced to ride at anchor all night long in the open sea without food and without sleep, keeping watch lest the ships of the Maronites should attack us in the night.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>Nor was this all. It was our lot to have by night rain and thunder and a violent wind at that season of the year (for the time was just at the setting of the Pleiades<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Roughly the end of October, when the stormy season had set in.</note>); so can you not imagine, men of the jury, what despondency fell upon our men, and what an amount of desertion I had again to face after this? For the old sailors had borne many hardships and received but little compensation—merely what I was able to borrow and give to each man in addition to what they had had from me before, since the general did not supply enough even for their daily sustenance. By now I had served three months beyond my term, and the defendant had not yet come to take over the ship; but I borrowed money and hired sailors to replace those who had deserted.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p rend="indent">The defendant alone of the trierarchs appointed to succeed us has no excuse left him for not having come to take over the ship long before. For Euctemon, the pentecontarch, after he was sent home from the Hellespont on account of his sickness, when he reached port and heard that Polycles had been appointed to relieve me, knowing that the term of my trierarchy had expired and that I was now serving over time, took with him my father-in-law, Deinias, and coming up to Polycles in the sample market, bade him set sail and take over the ship with all speed, telling him that the expenses which were incurred every day in addition to the provision money supplied by the general were very heavy.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>He told him in detail of the pay given each month to the rowers and the marines, both to the sailors whom he had himself hired at Lampsacus and to those who came on board subsequently to replace those who had deserted, and also of the additional sums which I had given to each of the old sailors at their request after the term of my trierarchy had expired, and all the rest of the money expended upon the ship from day to day. With all these matters Euctemon was thoroughly acquainted, for it was through him as pentecontarch that all purchases and disbursements were made.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>He told him, too, about the ship’s equipment, that it was wholly my own, and that I had nothing from the public stores. <q type="spoken">Therefore,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">plan to come to an agreement with him, or sail from here taking your own equipment with you. I think, however,</q> he added, <q type="spoken">that he will readily come to terms with you; for he owes money there, which he will be glad to pay from the price of the equipment.</q> When the defendant heard these words from Euctemon and Deinias my father-in-law, he made no answer to them regarding the matters of which they spoke but, they said, he broke into a laugh, and said, <q type="spoken">The mouse has just tasted pitch<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> A familiar proverb of those who fall into difficulties through their own folly. See <bibl n="Theoc. Ep. 14">Theocritus 14.51</bibl>. The second clause fits the present situation: Pasion had sought Athenian citizenship: Apollodorus is now paying the price.</note>; for he wanted to be an Athenian.</q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>Well, when he paid no heed to what he heard from Euctemon and Deinias, later on Pythodorus of Acharnae,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Acharnae, a deme of the tribe Oeneïs.</note> and Apollodorus of Leuconoë, <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Leuconoe, a deme of the tribe Leontis.</note> friends and connections of mine, again approached him, and urged him to go and take over the ship, as he had been designated as my successor; and they told him about the equipment, that it was wholly my own, and that I had nothing from the public stores.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><q type="spoken">So, if you want to make use of that,</q> they said, <q type="spoken">leave money here, and do not run the risk of carrying it abroad.</q> For they wanted to redeem the farm for me by paying Archeneüs and Thrasylochus thirty minae. Regarding the wear and tear of the ship’s equipment they were willing to draw up an agreement with him, and themselves to be sureties for me, that he would assuredly have the terms which the other trierarchs gave to their successors.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I am speaking the truth in all this, the clerk shall read you the depositions bearing upon these matters.</p> <p rend="indent"><label>The Depositions</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p rend="indent">There are many proofs from which I think I can show you that Polycles neither at the first intended to take over the ship from me, nor, after he was forced by you and your decree to go and join the ship, was he willing to take it over as my successor. For after he arrived at Thasos, when I was serving for the fourth month after my term had expired, I took witnesses with me, as many of the citizens as I could and the marines and rowers, and, coming up to him in the market-place at Thasos, I bade him take over the ship from me as my successor and repay me what I had expended since the expiration of my term.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>I was ready to reckon it up item by item, while I had by me as witnesses to the expenditures the sailors and the marines and the rowers, in order that, if he disputed anything, I might refute him at once. Everything had been recorded so accurately by me, that I had written down not only the disbursements themselves, but also the objects for which the money had been spent, the nature of the service rendered, what the price was, in the coinage of what country the payment was made, and what the loss in exchange was, in order that I might be able to give convincing proof to my successor, if he thought any false entries were being made against him.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>And besides I was ready to take an oath to confirm my reckoning. Upon my giving him this challenge, he answered that he had no interest in what I was saying. At this point a servant came from the general with orders for me to set sail. The order was given to me, not to the defendant, my successor, upon whom the duty was now devolving; but the reason for this I will explain in the course of my address. For the time being it seemed to me best to weigh anchor and sail where he ordered me, </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>but when I put into Thasos again, after towing the vessels to Strymê as the general had ordered, bidding the sailors and the marines and the rowers to remain on board, I went by myself to the house where the general, Timomachus, lodged, wishing that he too should be present, when I offered the ship with her full crew to the defendant Polycles.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>I found the defendant there and the trierarchs and those who were to succeed them, and some others of our citizens; and on coming in I spoke at once to Polycles in the presence of the general, and called upon him to take over the ship from me, and to pay me for the disbursements made during the period since my term of service had expired; and I asked him about the ship’s equipment, whether he would take it over, or whether he had brought equipment of his own with him.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>When I thus challenged him, he asked me why I was the only one of the trierarchs who had equipment of my own, and whether the state did not know that there were some people able to provide equipment for their ships, so that the state itself did not need to do it. <q type="spoken">Or have you,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">so far surpassed the others in wealth as to be the only one of the trierarchs to have equipment of your own and gilded ornaments?</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Who,</q> he continued, <q type="spoken">could endure your madness and extravagance, a crew corrupted and accustomed to receive large sums in advance and to enjoy exemption from services normally required on board a ship, and able also to make use of the baths, and marines and rowers rendered luxurious by high wages paid in full? Bad ways,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">are these you have taught the army. It is partly your fault that the troops of the other trierarchs have become more unruly, seeking to have the same treatment that yours enjoy; you ought to have done the same as the other trierarchs.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>Upon his saying this, I answered that the reason I had taken no equipment from the docks was because, <q type="spoken">You,</q> said I, <q type="spoken">have brought the stores into bad repute. However, if you like, take this equipment of mine; if not, provide equipment for yourself. As for the sailors and marines and rowers, if you say that they have been corrupted by me, take over the ship, and get sailors and marines and rowers for yourself, who will sail with you without pay. But take over the ship, for it is not my place to serve any longer; the term of my trierarchy has expired, and I have served four months beyond it.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>When I said this to him, he answered that his colleague in the trierarchy had not come to the ship. <q type="spoken">So,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">I will not take over the ship alone.</q></p> <p rend="indent">To prove that I am telling you the truth in this, that in the market-place he made the answer mentioned above, that he cared nothing for what I was saying, and that in the house where Timomachus lodged he declared that he would not take over the ship alone—the clerk shall read you the depositions bearing on these facts.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p rend="indent">After this, men of the jury, when the defendant would neither take over the ship from me nor pay the expenses for the period beyond my term, and the general ordered me to set sail, I approached him in the harbor in Thasos, and in the presence of the general, when the ship was fully manned, and made a proposal, which was not indeed fair, since the advantage was all on his side, but which was forced upon me by the circumstances.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><q type="spoken">Since you say, Polycles, that your associate in the trierarchy has not come, I will get from him, if I can, the amount expended during my extra time of service, the four months; but do you take over the ship, and first serve as trierarch for your term, the six months; then, if your colleague shall have arrived in the interim, you will give over the ship, having fulfilled your term of service; and, if he does not come, you will suffer no great harm in serving two months beyond your term.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Or, am I, who have served for my own term and that of my colleague, to have performed extra service as trierarch for you and your associate, and are you, who have incurred no expense, to refuse either to take over the ship and serve your own term, or to reimburse me for the expenses I have borne?</q> When I said this, he answered that I was romancing. Then the general ordered me to go on board my ship and put to sea with him.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that he did give me this answer, <label>(to the clerk)</label> please read the deposition.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition</label></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p rend="indent">I wish now to mention a matter to you, to the end that you may understand how flagrantly I have been wronged. For about the same time Mnesilochus of Perithoidae<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Perithoidae, a deme of the tribe Oeneïs.</note> and Phrasierides<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Possibly the same as the friend of Timotheus mentioned in <bibl n="Dem. 49" >Dem. 49</bibl>.</note> of Anaphlystus were appointed to succeed Hagnias and Praxicles. But, since Phrasierides did not arrive to join the ship, Mnesilochus went to Thasos and took over the trireme from Hagnias, </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p>and paid to Hagnias what the latter convinced him was due for the expenses he had incurred on their behalf while serving as trierarch beyond his time, and hired from Hagnias the ship’s equipment, and assumed himself the duties of trierarch. Afterwards, when the men from Phrasierides came, they paid his share of the expenses to Mnesilochus, and for the remainder of the term joined in meeting whatever expenditures he required for the ship.</p> <p><label>(To the clerk.)</label> Read, please, the deposition establishing these facts.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition</label></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p rend="indent">Perhaps, now, men of the jury, you want to hear for what possible reason the general failed to compel the defendant to take over the ship, when he came to it as my successor, the laws on the matter being so strict. In regard to this I wish to show you clearly why it was. For Timomachus, men of the jury, wished above all things to have the trireme well equipped for every service.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>He knew, however, that the defendant, if he took over the ship, would manage wretchedly as trierarch; that he would get service neither from the crew nor the marines nor the rowers, for not one of them would stay with him. Besides, he knew that, if he ordered him to sail without giving him money, he would not put out to sea at his bidding, as I should do, but would make trouble. And in addition to this he borrowed from him thirty minae on the understanding that he would not force him to take over the ship.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>But why it was that he was especially incensed against me and treated me despitefully, and would never on any occasion listen to a word from me regarding any matter, I wish to show you clearly, that you may understand that I cared less at that time for my own comfort or for the general’s power than for the people of Athens and the laws, and that I endured ill-treatment and abuse, which were far more grievous to me than the expenses I incurred.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p>For, while the fleet was lying at Thasos, a despatch-boat came from Methonê in Macedonia to Thasos, bringing a man with letters from Callistratus to Timomachus, which, as I afterward learned, contained a request that he should send the swiftest-sailing ship he had to bring Callistratus to him. At once, then, at daybreak the next morning, the officer from the general came and ordered me to summon my crew to the ship.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>When it was manned, Callippus, the son of Philon, of Aexonê,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Aexone, a deme of the tribe Cecropis.</note> came on board, and ordered the pilot to steer the course for Macedonia. When we had reached a place on the opposite mainland, a trading post of the Thasians, and had gone ashore and were getting our dinner, one of the sailors, Callicles, the son of Epitrephes, of Thria,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Thria, a deme of the tribe Oeneïs</note> came up to me, and said that he wished to speak to me about a matter which concerned myself. I bade him speak on, and he said that he wanted to make what return he could for the help I had given him in his need.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p><q type="spoken">Do you know, then,</q> he asked, <q type="spoken">for what purpose you are making this voyage, and where you are going?</q> When I replied that I did not know, he said, <q type="spoken">Then I will tell you; for you must learn this in order to plan your action aright. You are going,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">to bring Callistratus, an exile whom the Athenians have twice condemned to death, from Methonê to Thasos to Timomachus, his kinsman by marriage. I have found this out,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">from the servants of Callippus. For your own part, then, if you are wise, you will not permit any exile to come on board the ship; for the laws forbid it.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p>On hearing this from Callicles, I approached Callippus, and asked him to what place he was sailing, and whom he was going to fetch. He spoke roughly to me and threatened me in a way you can easily understand (for you are not without experience of the ways of Callippus), and I said to him, <q type="spoken">I hear that you are sailing to fetch Callistratus. Now, I will transport no exile, nor will I go to fetch him; for the laws forbid anyone to give harborage to any exile, and make one who does so liable to the same punishment. I shall, therefore, sail back to the general in Thasos.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p>So, when the sailors came on board, I ordered the pilot to sail back to Thasos. Callippus protested, and bade him sail for Macedonia in accordance with the general’s commands; but Posidippus, the pilot, answered him that I was trierarch of the ship, and the one responsible, and that he got his pay from me; he would sail, therefore, whither I bade him sail—to Thasos, to the general.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>When we reached Thasos the next day, Timomachus sent for me to come to the place where he lodged outside the wall. I was afraid that he would put me under arrest on false charges preferred by Callippus, so did not obey the summons in person, but told the officer that, if he had anything to say to me, I should be in the market-place; and I sent my servant with him, in order that, if the general had any orders to give he might hear and report to me.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>It was for this reason, which I have stated to you, men of the jury, that Timomachus did not force the defendant to take over the ship, and besides, he wanted the use of the ship for himself, as she was the best sailer. As for the trireme of Thrasylochus of Anagyrus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Anagyrus, a deme of the tribe Erectheïs.</note> on board which he was himself sailing, he induced Thrasylochus to let his trierarchy to Callippus, that Callippus, being in full control of the ship, might carry Callistratus about, as he pleased. Timomachus himself came on board my ship, and sailed around here and there until he reached the Hellespont.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p rend="indent">When he had no longer need of ships of war, he put on board my vessel Eucinus of Pallenê,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> <placeName key="perseus,Pallene">Pallene</placeName>, a deme of the tribe Antiochis.</note> as commander, and, enjoining upon him to give the sailors money every day, ordered me to sail for home. When, then, on our homeward voyage we were in Tenedos, and Lucinus, despite the orders given him by Timomachus, was furnishing no money for sustenance to the sailors (he said he had none, but should get some from Mytilenê), and the men had nothing with which to buy provisions, and without food could not have continued rowing, </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>again taking some of our citizens as witnesses I approached the defendant in Tenedos, and bade him take over the ship as my successor, and to reimburse me for the expenses I had incurred while I serving as trierarch in his stead beyond my term. I did this in order that he might not make use of the pretext, in his defence before you, that I refused to hand over the ship to him because I was ambitious to sail home in a fast-sailing ship and show off to you my lavish expenditure.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p>Since he refused to take over the ship, and the sailors were asking for money that they might buy supplies, I came up to him again, having witnesses with me, and asked whether he had come out with money with the purpose of taking over the ship from me, or not. On his replying that he had brought money with him, I urged him to lend me some on the security of the ship’s equipment, that I might distribute it among the sailors and bring the ship home, seeing that he refused to take over the ship, although he was my successor.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p>To this request of mine he replied that he would not lend me a farthing. Accordingly I borrowed from Cleanax and Eperatus, friends of my father in Tenedos, and gave the sailors their provision-money; for on account of my being Pasion’s son, and the fact that he was connected by ties of hospitality with many, and was trusted throughout the Greek world, I had no difficulty in borrowing money wherever I needed it.</p> <p rend="indent">To prove that the statements I am making to you are true, I shall produce for you the depositions establishing these facts.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Depositions</label></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p rend="indent">The clerk has read the depositions of all those whom I was able to produce, who were present in person, to prove that I again and again offered to give over the ship to Polycles, and that he refused to take it. More than that, I have shown by convincing circumstantial evidence, why it was that he refused to take over the ship. I desire now to have read to you the law also regarding those appointed to succeed others in the trierarchy, that you may know how severe the penalties are when a man fails to take over a ship from his predecessor within the appointed time, and how Polycles scoffed, not at me only, but at you and at the laws.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>So far as he is concerned, all measures undertaken by the state and her allies have failed; for he neither joined his ship, as the law commands, nor, when he did come, was he willing to take over the ship from his predecessor; whereas I served for my own term and that of my associate in the trierarchy, and when my term of service had expired and I was ordered by the general to sail to Hieron, I convoyed the grain for our people, </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p>that they might buy in a plentiful market, and that, so far as depended on me, there should be no lack; and I performed for the general every other service which he desired either of myself or of my trireme, not only spending my property, but risking my life as well through always making the voyage in person, although my domestic affairs were in such a condition at that time that you would pity me, if you heard them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>My mother lay sick,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> The speaker’s pretended concern for his mother accords ill with the attitude he shows toward her in <bibl n="Dem. 45">Dem. 45</bibl>.</note> and was at the point of death while I was abroad, so that she was unable any longer to help in the depletion of my resources save to a slight extent. I had been but six days at home, when, after she had seen and greeted me, she breathed her last, being no longer mistress of her property, so as to give me I as much as she wished. She had often sent for me before this, begging me to come to her by myself if I could not come in my ship.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p>My wife, too, to whom I am deeply attached, was in poor health for a long time during my absence; my children were small and my estate was in debt; my land not only produced no crops, but that year, as you all know, the water even dried up in the wells, so that not a vegetable grew in the garden; and my creditors at the expiration of the year came to collect their interest, unless the principal was paid to them according to the contract.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p>When I heard these facts from the lips of those who came and also through letters from my relatives, how do you think I must have felt, and how many tears must I have shed, while I reckoned up my present troubles and was longing to see my children and my wife, and my mother whom I had little hope of finding alive? For what is sweeter to a man than these, or why should one wish to live, if deprived of them?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p rend="indent">Although the misfortunes which had befallen me were thus grievous, I did not count my private interests of so much importance as your interests, but felt that I ought to rise above the wasting of my fortune, the neglect of my household affairs, and the sickness of my wife and my mother, so that no one could accuse me of deserting my post or letting my ship be useless to the state.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p>In return for all this I now implore you, that, as I showed myself obedient and useful in your service, so you will now take thought of me, and, remembering all that I have told you, the depositions which I have produced and the decrees, you will succor me when I am being wronged, will mete out punishment in your own interest, and will exact repayment of the funds expended in the defendant’s behalf. Or who will wish to be zealous on your service, when men see that you neither reward those who are honest and obedient, nor punish those who are dishonest and disobedient?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>The clerk shall read you the law and an account of my expenses in detail for the period during which I served as trierarch beyond my term on the defendant’s behalf, and the sums which the several deserters took with them when they ran away from the ship, and where they went, in order that you may be assured that neither now nor at any time before have I made false statements to you. I count it my duty to serve you in a manner above reproach for the period prescribed by law, and as regards those who scorn you and the laws, and will not obey the laws, to convict them and get them punished in your courts.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>Be assured that it will be no more in my interest than in your own that you will punish Polycles, nor will you be showing concern merely for those who have served as trierarchs in the past; no, you will be taking thought also for those who are to serve in the future, so that those who perform public services may not be discouraged, and those who are designated as their successors may not show contempt toward the laws, but may go to their ships when they are appointed. These matters you should bear in mind, and reach a fair and just decision regarding all the points at issue.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p rend="indent">I should gladly ask you, men of the jury, what opinion you would have had of me, if, when my term of service had expired and the defendant had not come to take over the ship, I had refused to serve longer when the general so ordered, but had sailed away. Would you not have been indignant and have thought that I was wronging you? If, then, you would have been indignant in that case, because I refused to serve beyond my term, should you not now exact from the defendant the money expended by me on his behalf, seeing that he did not take over the ship?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p rend="indent">To prove that it is not in my case only that he failed to take over his ship, but that on a former occasion also, when he was the associate of Euripides in the trierarchy and there was an agreement between them that each should sail for six months, when Euripides had sailed and the term had expired, Polycles did not take over the ship from him,—to prove this, I say, the clerk shall read the deposition.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Deposition.</label></p> </div>
