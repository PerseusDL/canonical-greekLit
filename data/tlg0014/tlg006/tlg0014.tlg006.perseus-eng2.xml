            <div type="section" n="1">
                <p>Whenever, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, we are
                    discussing Philip's intrigues and his violations of the peace, I observe that
                    all the speeches on our side are manifestly inspired by justice and generosity,
                    and those who denounce Philip are all felt to be saying exactly the right thing;
                    but of the much needed action, which alone would make the speeches worth
                    hearing, little or nothing ensues. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="2">
                <p>Unfortunately all our national affairs have now reached to such a pass, that the
                    more completely and manifestly Philip is convicted of violating the peace with
                    us and of plotting against the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
                        >Greece</placeName>, the more difficult it is to suggest the right course of
                    action. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="3">
                <p>The reason, Athenians, is this. Though all who aim at their own aggrandizement
                    must be checked, not by speeches, but by practical measures, yet, in the first
                    place, we who come before you shrink from any definite proposal or advice, being
                    reluctant to incur your displeasure; we prefer to dilate on Philip's shocking
                    behavior and the like topics; and, secondly, you who sit here are indeed better
                    equipped than Philip for making speeches about justice and for appreciating them
                    in the mouth of another, but, when it comes to hindering the accomplishment of
                    his present plans, you remain utterly inactive. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="4">
                <p>The result is, I suppose, inevitable and perhaps reasonable. Where either side
                    devotes its time and energy, there it succeeds the better—Philip in action, but
                    you in argument. So if you still think it enough to employ the sounder
                    arguments, that is easy; your task entails no trouble. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="5">
                <p>But if you have to devise means whereby our present fortunes shall be repaired,
                    and their further decline shall not take us completely by surprise, and we shall
                    not be confronted by a mighty power which we shall be unable even to withstand,
                    then our method of deliberation must be changed, and all who speak and all who
                    listen must choose the best and safest policy instead of the easiest and most
                    agreeable. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="6">
                <p>In the first place, Athenians, if anyone views with confidence the present power
                    of Philip and the extent of his dominions, if anyone imagines that all this
                    imports no danger to our city and that you are not the object of his
                    preparations, I must express my astonishment, and beg you all alike to listen to
                    a brief statement of the considerations that have led me to form the opposite
                    conclusion and to regard Philip as our enemy. Then, if you think me the better
                    prophet, adopt my advice; if you prefer those who have so confidently trusted
                    him, give them your allegiance. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="7">
                <p>Now I, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, reason thus.
                    What did Philip first get under his control after the Peace? <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> and the Phocian
                    government. Well, what did he make of these? He chose to act in the interests of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, not of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. And why so? Because, I believe,
                    guided in his calculations by ambition and the desire of universal dominion,
                    regardless of the claims of peace and quietness and justice, </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="8">
                <p>he rightly saw that to our city and our national character he could offer
                    nothing, he could do nothing, that would tempt you from selfish motives to
                    sacrifice to him any of the other Greek states, but that you, reverencing
                    justice, shrinking from the discredit involved in such transactions, and
                    exercising due and proper forethought, would resist any such attempt on his part
                    as stoutly as if you were actually at war with him. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="9">
                <p>But as to the Thebans, he believed—and the event justified him—that in return for
                    benefits received they would give him a free hand for the future and, so far
                    from opposing or thwarting him, would even join forces with him, if he so
                    ordered. Today, on the same assumption, he is doing the Messenians and the
                    Argives a good turn. That, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, is the highest compliment he could pay you. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="10">
                <p>For by these very acts you stand judged the one and only power in the world
                    incapable of abandoning the common rights of the Greeks at any price, incapable
                    of bartering your devotion to their cause for any favor or any profit. And it
                    was natural that he should form this opinion of you and the contrary opinion of
                    the Argives and Thebans, because he not merely looks to the present, but also
                    draws a lesson from the past. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="11">
                <p>For I suppose he learns from history and from report that your ancestors, when
                    they might, at the price of submission to the Great King, have become the
                    paramount power in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, not only
                    refused to entertain that proposal, conveyed to them by Alexander, an ancestor
                    of Philip's line, but chose to quit their homes and endure every hardship, and
                    thereafter wrought those deeds which all men are always eager to relate, though
                    no one has ever been able to tell them worthily; and therefore I shall not be
                    wrong in passing them over, for they are indeed great beyond any man's power of
                    speech. On the other hand, he learns that the ancestors of these Thebans and
                    Argives either fought for the barbarians or did not fight against them. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="12">
                <p>He knows, then, that they both will pursue their private interests, irrespective
                    of the common advantage of the Greeks. So he thought that if he chose you, he
                    would be choosing friends, and that your friendship would be based on justice;
                    but that if he attached himself to the others, he would find in them the tools
                    of his own ambition. That is why, now as then, he chooses them rather than you.
                    For surely it is not that he regards their fleets as superior to ours, nor that,
                    having discovered some inland empire, he has abandoned the seaboard with its
                    harbors, nor yet that he has a short memory for the speeches and the promises
                    that gained for him the Peace.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Had Philip
                        renounced his hope of founding a maritime and commercial state and confined
                        himself to extending his empire north and west of <placeName
                            key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, his rejection of Athenian
                        friendship would be intelligible. As it is, it must be otherwise
                        explained.</note>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="13">
                <p>But it may be urged, by someone who claims to know all about it, that he acted on
                    that occasion, not from ambition or from any of those motives with which I find
                    fault, but because the claims of the Thebans were more just than ours. Now that
                    is precisely the one argument that he cannot use now. What! The man who orders
                    the Lacedaemonians to give up their claims to <placeName key="perseus,Messene"
                        >Messene</placeName>, how could he pretend that he handed over <placeName
                        key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011235"
                        >Coronea</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>
                    because he thought it an act of justice? </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="14">
                <p>“But,” it will be urged (for there is this excuse left), “he was forced to yield
                    against his better judgement, finding himself hemmed in between the Thessalian
                    cavalry and the Theban heavy infantry.” Good! So they say he is waiting to
                    regard the Thebans with suspicion, and some circulate a rumor that he will
                    fortify Elatea.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">To rebuild the walls of Elatea,
                        destroyed in 346, would be a check to the Thebans, as barring their way to
                            <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>. Philip's occupation of
                        Elatea in 339 is the theme of the well-known passage in <bibl
                            n="Dem. 18.169">Dem. 18.169</bibl> ff. Demosthenes is playing on the two
                        meanings of <foreign xml:lang="grc">me/llei</foreign>, “he is likely to” and
                        “he is delaying to.”</note>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="15">
                <p>That is just what he is “waiting” to do, and will go on “waiting,” in my opinion.
                    But he is not “waiting” to help the Messenians and Argives against the
                    Lacedaemonians: he is actually dispatching mercenaries and forwarding supplies,
                    and he is expected in person with a large force. What! The Lacedaemonians, the
                    surviving enemies of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, he is
                    engaged in destroying; the Phocians, whom he has himself already destroyed, he
                    is now engaged in preserving! And who is prepared to believe that? </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="16">
                <p>For my part I do not believe that Philip, if he acted in the first place
                    reluctantly and under compulsion, or if he were now inclined to throw the
                    Thebans over, would be persistently opposing their enemies. But if we may judge
                    from his present conduct, it is plain that on that occasion also he acted from
                    deliberate choice, and everything, if correctly observed, points to the fact
                    that all his intrigues are directed against <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="17">
                <p>And today at any rate this policy is in a measure forced upon him. For observe!
                    He wants to rule, and he has made up his mind that you, and you only, are his
                    rivals. He has long injured you; of nothing is he more conscious than of that.
                    For it is by holding the cities which are really yours that he retains safe
                    possession of all the rest, and he feels that if he gave up <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>, his own country would not be safe
                    for him. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="18">
                <p>He knows, then, these two facts—that he is intriguing against you and that you
                    are aware of it. Assuming that you are intelligent, he thinks you are bound to
                    hate him, and he is on the alert, expecting some blow to fall, if you can seize
                    an opportunity and if he cannot get in his blow first. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="19">
                <p>That is why he is wide awake and ready to strike, and why he is courting certain
                    people to the detriment of our city—Thebans, I mean, and those Peloponnesians
                    who share their views. He imagines that their cupidity will lead them to accept
                    the present situation, while their natural dullness will prevent them from
                    foreseeing anything that may follow. Yet men of even moderate intelligence might
                    perceive some clear indications, which I had occasion to point out to the
                    Messenians and the Argives, and which may perhaps with advantage be repeated to
                    you. </p>

                <p>“Can you not imagine,” I said, addressing the Messenians, “how annoyed the
                    Olynthians would have been to hear a word said against Philip in the days when
                    he was handing over to them Anthemus, to which all the former kings of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> laid claim, when he was
                    making them a present of <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>,
                    expelling the Athenian settlers, and when he had taken upon himself the
                    responsibility of a quarrel with us and had given them the territory of
                        <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName> for their own use? Do you
                    imagine they expected to be treated as they have been, or would have believed

                <p>Nevertheless,” said I, “after a brief enjoyment of other men's territory, they
                    have long been robbed by Philip of their own, expelled with contumely, not
                    merely vanquished but betrayed, bought and sold by their own country-men. For
                    truly such close communications with tyranny corrupt good constitutions. </p>

                        >Magnesia</placeName>, they ever dreamed that a Council of Ten<note

                            >Thessaly</placeName>. The two accounts may be reconciled by assuming
                        that he retained the old fourfold division of the country, but set up an
                        oligarchy of ten in each division. Philip, whose policy was to divide and
                        conquer, would be unlikely to centralize the government. It is just possible
                        that <foreign xml:lang="grc">dekadarxi/an</foreign> may be a mistaken

                        would be strange. Owing to the decarchies which Lysander imposed on so many
                        free cities at the end of the Peloponnesian war, the number ten would have
                        the same sinister associations in <placeName key="tgn,1000074"

                        >Venice</placeName>.</note> would be established among them, as it is today,
                    or that the same man who restored to them the Amphictyonic meeting at <placeName

                    their own peculiar revenues? Impossible! But so it came to pass, as all men may

                    deceived and cozened you. Verily,” I said, “there are manifold means devised by

                    safe one for all, but invaluable for democracies against tyrants. And what is
                    that bulwark? It is mistrust. Guard that; hold fast to that. If you preserve it,

                    sworn foe of freedom and of law. Beware,” said I, “lest, seeking to be rid of
