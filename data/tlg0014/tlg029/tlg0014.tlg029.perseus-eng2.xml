                <head>Against Aphobus In Defence of Phanus Charged with Giving False Testimony III</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">If I were not conscious, men of the jury, that in a former suit against Aphobus I had readily (so absolutely manifest were his wrongdoings) convicted him of lies greater and more outrageous than these which he now utters, I should have grave doubts of my ability to show how he seeks to lead you astray in regard to each one of them. As it is, however (be it said with the favor of heaven), if you prove fair and impartial hearers, I have strong hopes that you will become as fully aware of the shamelessness of this man as were the jurors in the former trial. If the case required eloquence or cleverness I should shrink through distrust of my youth; but, as matters are, I need merely point out and rehearse to you what the plaintiff’s conduct toward us has been. From this it will be easy, I think, for all of you to determine which of us is the villain.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">I know that the plaintiff has instituted this suit, not because he believes he can convict anyone of having borne false witness against him, but because he thinks that the large amount of damages which he was condemned to pay will give rise to a feeling of prejudice against me, and of compassion toward himself. For this reason he is now seeking to defend himself against charges made in a suit that has already been decided, regarding which he had at the time no reasonable defence to make. I, for my part, men of the jury, if I had proceeded to execute the judgement against him and had been unwilling to make any reasonable concession, should even so have done no wrong in exacting the damages awarded by your decision; but for all that it might have been said that I had shown undue ruthlessness and enmity toward a man who is a relative in depriving him of all his property.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But, as it is, the precise contrary is the truth. This man with his co-trustees has robbed me of my entire patrimony, and, even after being clearly convicted in your court, he does not consider himself obliged to do anything reasonable. On the contrary he has dispersed his property, giving his farm-buildings to Aesius and his farm to Onetor, against whom he has forced me to engage in a troublesome lawsuit. He himself stripped the house of its furniture, took away the slaves, destroyed the wine-vat, tore off the doors, and all but set fire to the house itself; then he made off to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, where he has settled and paid the alien’s tax. You would, therefore, with better ground loathe this man for deeds like these, than judge me guilty of undue severity.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Regarding the rapacity and vile character of the plaintiff I purpose to speak at length before you later on, though what you have even now heard gives you a fair idea of it. But I shall now undertake to show you, that the testimony which has been given, about which you are going to cast your votes, is true. But one request I make of you, men of the jury, and it is a reasonable one—that you will give us both a fair hearing. This is as much in your interest as in mine, for the more accurate your knowledge of the facts, the more just and in harmony with your oaths will be the vote you will cast regarding them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>I shall show that Aphobus has not only acknowledged <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> to be a freeman, but has even proved it by his actions; that, furthermore, about this matter he has declined the absolutely sure test by torture,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">On the high value attributed by the Greeks to evidence extracted from a slave by torture see <bibl n="Dem. 30.37">Dem. 30.37</bibl>, and <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 1.15">Aristot. Rh. 1.15</bibl></note> and does not wish to have the truth brought to light that on the contrary he has recourse to trickery, brings forward false witnesses, and by his own words distorts the truth regarding what has taken place. So strong and so plain is the evidence by which I shall prove these statements that you will all see clearly that it is I who am speaking the truth, and that he has uttered not a word worthy of credence. I shall begin at a point which will make it easiest for you to learn the facts, and for me to instruct you regarding them in the briefest time.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">I instituted suit, men of the jury, against Demophon, Therippides and the plaintiff for breach of trust in their guardianship, for I had been defrauded by them of all my inheritance. When my suit against Aphobus in the first instance came up for trial, I proved clearly to the jury, as I shall prove to you, that he, in conjunction with the others, had robbed me of all the property that had been left me; and I relied upon no false testimony.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Here is a clear proof of this. A host of depositions was read at the trial, some of the deponents declaring that they had given to the plaintiff property of mine, others that he had received such property in their presence, still others that they had purchased goods from him, and paid him the price; yet he has charged not a single one of these with bearing false testimony. He has dared to attack this one piece of testimony, and it alone, although in it he cannot show that there was mention even of one single drachma.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And yet for the computation of the sums of which I had been robbed, I relied not so much on this man’s testimony, for there was no mention of money in it, but on the several statements of the others, against whom the plaintiff has made no charges. Therefore the jurymen who at that time heard my plea, not only found him guilty, but fixed the damages at the full amount stated in my complaint. Why was it, then, that he passed over the other witnesses and sued the defendant alone? I will tell you.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>In regard to all the witnesses who testified that he had received the money, he knew that the more discussion there should be over each separate point, the more convincingly would he be convicted of possessing it, and this was bound to be the case in a trial for false witness; for the accusations which I then made along with all the others in a small part of the time allotted me, I should now discuss severally and in detail in the time of an entire speech; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>whereas, if he attacked an answer given, he thought that as he had made an admission before, so now it would be in his power to make a denial.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, in attacking the testimony of the deponent he would deny his own previous admissions.</note> That is the reason why he attacks the testimony of this witness, the truth of whose testimony I mean to prove conclusively to you all, not on the basis of probabilities, or of arguments made up to fit the occasion, but by reasoning which, I am sure, will approve itself to you all as just and fair. Listen, and judge.</p></div> 
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">I knew, men of the jury, that I should find the whole contest centring about the deposition inserted in the record, and that it would be regarding the truth or falsehood of this that you would cast your votes, and I therefore determined that the first step for me to take was to offer Aphobus a challenge. What, then, did I do? I offered to surrender to him for examination by torture a slave who knew how to read and write, and who had been present when Aphobus made the admission in question, and who wrote down the statement of the witness. This man had been ordered by me not to use any fraud or trickery, nor to write down some and suppress others of the statements made by the plaintiff regarding the matters at issue, but simply to write the absolute truth, and what Aphobus actually said.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>What better opportunity could he have had of convicting us of falsehood than by putting my slave to torture? But Aphobus knew better than anyone else that the slave had borne true testimony, and therefore he declined the test. And in truth it is not one or two only who know these facts; the challenge was not made in secret, but in the midst of the agora where many were present.</p><p rend="indent">Call, please, the witnesses to these facts.</p><p rend="center"><label>The Witnesses</label></p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">The fellow is so cunning, and so ready to pretend ignorance of what is right, that, although he is pressing a suit for false witness, and although you are to cast your votes regarding this, and have sworn so to do, he refused the proffered examination by torture in regard to the testimony (the point to which he should have devoted his argument), and declares that he requires the slave to be given up for testing in regard to other matters. In this he is lying.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>Is it not indeed monstrous that he should claim that he is being outrageously treated by my refusal of his demand to have delivered to him for torture a freeman (for such I shall conclusively prove <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> to be), and should not consider that my witnesses are being outrageously treated, when I offer him one who is admittedly a slave, to be tested by torture regarding their testimony, and he refuses? For he surely cannot maintain this, that for some matters, which he himself desires, torture is a certain test, and for others not.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p rend="indent">Furthermore, men of the jury, the first witness to give this testimony was Aesius, the brother of the plaintiff. He now denies it, because he has allied himself in the suit with Aphobus; but at that time he gave this testimony along with the other witnesses, for he had no desire to perjure himself, or to suffer the penalty which would straightway follow. Surely now, if I had been getting up false testimony, I should not have put this man in my list of witnesses, seeing that he was more intimate with Aphobus than with anyone else in the world, and knowing that he was going to plead for him in the suit, and that he was an adversary of my own. It is not reasonable that one should call as witness to a false statement one who is an opponent of his own, and a brother of his adversary.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>I have many witnesses to these facts, and circumstantial proofs no fewer in number than the witnesses. In the first place, if he did not in very truth give this testimony, he would not be denying it now, but would have done so at once in the courtroom, when the deposition was read, for it would have answered his purpose better then than now. In the second place Aesius would not have kept quiet, but would have sued me for damages, if without cause I had made him liable to a charge of bearing false witness against his brother, a charge on which men run the risk both of damages in money and the loss of citizenship.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>Again, in seeking to bring the truth of the matter to light, he would have demanded of me the slave who wrote the depositions, in order that, if I refused to give him up, I might seem to have no just ground for my statements. But, as it is, so far from doing anything of the sort, he refused to accept the slave for torture, when I, on his denial that he had given the evidence, offered him. So plain is it that regarding this matter too both he and Aphobus as well were alike unwilling to have recourse to torture.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p rend="indent">To prove that my words are true, that after Aesius had given his testimony with the other witnesses, he made no denial of the fact, when, standing by the plaintiff’s side in the courtroom, he heard the deposition read, and that, when I offered the slave to them to be questioned by torture regarding all these matters, he refused to accept the offer—regarding each of these points severally I shall produce witnesses. Please call them here.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Witnesses</label></p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p rend="indent">I wish now to set forth to you, men of the jury, what I consider a stronger proof than all those that have been mentioned, to show that the plaintiff did give this answer. When, despite the admissions which he is proved to have made, he demanded of me <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> for torture, I was so eager to show on the spot that this, too, was a subterfuge on his part, that what do you think I did?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>I summoned Aphobus to give evidence against Demo, his uncle and a partner in his crimes. I wrote out the testimony which he now attacks as false and ordered him to make a deposition to it. At first he brazenly refused, but when the arbitrator bade him depose, or deny the fact under oath, he deposed, sorely against his will. And yet if the man was a slave, and had not been already admitted by Aphobus here to be free, what in the world induced him to make this deposition? Why did he not deny it on oath, and so get free of the affair?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>Pray note that in regard to this matter also I was ready to give over to him for torture the slave who had written the deposition, who would know his own handwriting, and who clearly remembered that Aphobus had made the deposition. I was ready to do this, not for want of witnesses who were present, for there were some; but in order that he might not accuse these men of giving false testimony, and that the result of the torture might support them. Yet it is not fair to condemn the witnesses on his account. They alone of men who have as yet stood trial before you can show that the plaintiff himself has borne witness to their testimony as to these matters.</p><p rend="indent">To prove that I am speaking the truth, take the challenge and the deposition.</p><p rend="center"><label>The Challenge. The Deposition</label></p></div> 
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p rend="indent">Such are the legal tests which he has refused, and so numerous the proofs by which he is shown to be acting with malice and insincerity; yet he demands that you put credence in his own witnesses, and he slanders mine, and declares that their testimony is false.</p> <p rend="indent">I wish now to speak of the matter on the basis of probabilities. I am certain that you would all agree that those who give false testimony are led to do so by bribes through stress of poverty, or by friendship, or else by enmity toward the opposite party in the suit.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>Now no one of these reasons would have led the men to testify in my favor. Not friendship; how could that be, seeing that they are not engaged in the same pursuits, nor are they of like age, I will not say with me, but with one another? Not enmity against my adversary, that is plain; for one of them is his brother and pleads on his side; Phanus is a close friend and a member of the same tribe; and Philip is neither friend nor enemy, so that this motive, too, cannot be justly charged against them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>Furthermore, no one could say that poverty was the ground, for they all possess means so ample that they willingly assume the expense of public services, and discharge whatever duties are laid upon them. Besides all this, they are well known to you, and you know nothing to their discredit; for they are worthy citizens. Yet, if they are not poor, nor enemies of the plaintiff, nor friends of mine, how can it be right to suspect them of bearing false witness? I certainly do not know.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p rend="indent">My opponent was aware of all this, and knew better than anybody else that their testimony was true, but nonetheless he brings forward a malicious charge against them, and not only declares that he did not make the statement which I have proved in the most conclusive manner that he did make, but even asserts that the man, <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName>, is in fact a slave. I wish in a very few words to prove that in this, too, he is lying. I was ready, men of the jury, regarding this point also to give over to him to be tested by torture my female slaves, who remember that my father on his death-bed set this man free.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>Besides this, my mother was ready to call to her side my sister and myself, and swear, with imprecations on our heads if she spoke falsely—we were her only children, and it was for our sakes that she gave herself up to a life of widowhood—that my father when he was about to die had set this man free, and that <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> was regarded by us as free thereafter. Let no one of you assume that she would have been willing to make this oath with imprecations on our heads if she had not known well that what she was to swear to was true.</p> <p rend="indent">Come now, to prove that I am speaking the truth and that we were ready to do these things, call the witnesses thereto.</p> <p rend="center"><label>The Witnesses</label></p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p rend="indent">So many were the just arguments we had to urge, and so ready were we to have recourse to the most infallible tests regarding the testimony given; and yet the plaintiff evades all these, and fancies that by slandering me regarding the trial which has already taken place, and bringing accusations against me, he can induce you to convict the witness,—a piece of trickery the most unfair and the most rapacious imaginable.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>For he has himself suborned men to bear false witness about these matters, having as co-workers his brother-in-law Onetor, and Timocrates<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Timocrates: possibly the same as the Timocrates against whom Demosthenes delivered <bibl n="Dem. 24">Dem. 24</bibl></note>; we had no forewarning of this, and supposed that the contest would be regarding the deposition alone, and therefore have not come prepared with witnesses regarding the guardianship accounts. Nevertheless, despite the fellow’s trickery, I think that, simply by reciting the facts, I shall easily convince you that no man was ever more justly convicted than he.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>It was not because I refused to allow <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> to be put to the torture, nor because he himself admitted the man to be a freeman, nor yet because these witnesses gave their testimony; but because he was proved to have taken possession of large sums belonging to me, and because he did not let the estate, though the laws so ordered and my father had so directed in his will, as I shall plainly show you. For these were things that anyone could see, the laws, namely, and the amount of my property which these men had taken as plunder; but as for <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName>, nobody knew even who he was. You will see from the charges brought against Aphobus that these things are so.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p rend="indent">For, men of the jury, when I instituted my suit against him concerning his guardianship, I did not fix the damages at a lump sum, as one bringing forward a baseless charge out of malice would have done, but specified each item, stating the source of each, the precise amount, and the person from whom it had been received. In no case did I add mention of <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> as having knowledge of any of these matters.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>Hence this is the beginning of the complaint: <q type="written">Demosthenes makes the following charges against Aphobus. Aphobus has in his possession moneys of mine, received by him in his capacity as guardian, as follows: eighty minae, which he received as the marriage-portion of my mother in accordance with the terms of my father’s will.</q> This is the first of the sums of which I claim to have been defrauded. Now what was the declaration of the witnesses? <q type="written">That they were present before the arbitrator, Notharchus, when Aphobus admitted that <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> was a freeman, having been emancipated by the father of Demosthenes.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>Consider now for yourselves whether in your judgement there could be an orator, or sophist or magician so wondrously clever in speaking as by means of this testimony to convince any man on earth that Aphobus is in possession of the marriage-portion of the speaker’s mother. What in heaven’s name would he say? <q type="spoken">Aphobus has admitted that <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> is a freeman.</q> And why on that account is he any the more in possession of the marriage-portion? The statement would surely not seem to prove it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>But how was it proved? In the first place, Therippides, his co-trustee, testified that he had given him the money. Secondly, Demo, his uncle, and the rest of the witnesses who were present, testified that he agreed to supply my mother with maintenance, as being in possession of her portion. Against these men he has lodged no charges, plainly because he knew that their testimony was true. Besides this, my mother was ready to call to her side my sister and myself, and swear with imprecations on our heads, if she spoke falsely, that Aphobus had received her marriage-portion according to the terms of my father’s will.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>Shall we, then, say, or shall we not, that he has possession of these eighty minae? And was it on the evidence of these witnesses here or of those that he was convicted? I think it was on the evidence of truth. He has enjoyed the interest on this sum for ten years, and even though judgement has been given against him, cannot bring himself to pay it back. Despite this, he declares that he has been outrageously treated and that he lost the suit by reason of these witnesses. Yet not one of them testified that he had received the marriage-portion.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p rend="indent">With regard to the maritime loan,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">With reference to these items see <bibl n="Dem. 27">Dem. 27</bibl></note> the sofa-makers, and the iron and the ivory that were left me, and my sister’s marriage-portion, at the purloining of which Aphobus connived in order to secure for himself the right to take whatever he pleased of my goods, listen, and see how just was the verdict given against him, and how absurd it would have been to examine <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> by torture regarding any of these matters.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p rend="indent">For as regards the purloining of funds at which you connived there is a law which expressly declares that you are responsible for them exactly as if you had them in your own possession. So what has the law to do with the testing of a slave by torture? But in the matter of the maritime loan you made common cause with Xuthus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In the inventory of the estate of the father of Demosthenes, given in <bibl n="Dem. 27">Dem. 27</bibl>, there is mention of a bottomry loan to Xuthus, amounting to seventy minae.</note> divided the money with him, and destroyed the contract, and now that you have arranged everything to suit your wish, and have done away with the documentary evidence (as Demo testified against you), you have recourse to trickery, and endeavor to mislead these gentlemen.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>Regarding the sofa-makers, if you took money, and made large profits for yourself by making loans on security that was mine—you, who should rather have prevented others from doing so—and finally made away with the slaves altogether, what, pray, can the witnesses do in your behalf? These men at any rate have not testified that you admitted lending money on the security of my slaves, and that you appropriated the slaves to yourself. On the contrary, it was you who acknowledged this in your account, and the witnesses testified to the fact against you.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p rend="indent">Now look you, as to the ivory and iron, I have this to say: all the slaves of the household know that the plaintiff used to sell these articles. I am ready now, as I was then, to give over to him any one of these slaves whom he may choose to be examined by torture. If then, he alleges that I refuse to surrender the man who has knowledge of the facts, and offer him others who have no such knowledge, he will but show that he ought all the more to have accepted my offer. For if those whom I offered to him as having knowledge of the facts, declared that he had none of these articles in his possession, he would of course have been acquitted of the charge.</p></div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>But nothing of the sort is the truth. It would have been proved past all question that he had sold the goods, and appropriated the profits. Therefore, he passed over those who were admittedly slaves, and demanded that a freeman be examined by torture, whom it would have been a crime for me to surrender; for it was not his purpose that he should sift out the matter, but that he might make a specious argument out of the fact that his demand was refused.</p><p rend="indent">Regarding, therefore, all these facts, first the marriage-portion, then his connivance with fraud, then all the rest, there shall be read to you the laws and the depositions, that you may have full knowledge.</p><p rend="center"><label>The Laws. The Depositions</label></p></div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p rend="indent">Not only from the facts already adduced can you see that Aphobus was not in any respect whatever prejudiced by my refusal to give the man up for torture, but also from a consideration of the matter itself. Let us suppose that <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> is being racked upon the wheel, and consider what Aphobus would most wish him to say. Would it not be that he was not aware that the plaintiff had any of the property in his possession? Well, suppose he says so. Does that prove that the plaintiff has none? Far from it; for I produced men who knew, men who paid him the money, men who were present in person, as witnesses. It is convincing proof, not if one is ignorant that a man has something in his possession (for there might be many such), but if one knows that he has it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p>But of the many witnesses who testified against you, what one have you sued for false testimony? Tell us. But you cannot. Yet you plainly convict yourself, and prove that you lie when you declare that you have been outrageously treated, and that you lost the suit unjustly, because this man was not given up to you—you who made no charge of giving false testimony against the witnesses who testified that you received and had in your possession the property, concerning which you demanded <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> for torture to prove that it was never left us. If you had really been wronged, it would have been more fitting to proceed against them. But you were not wronged, and are bringing a baseless suit out of malice.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p rend="indent">There are many points from which one may see your rascality, but most of all if one hears how you acted regarding the will. For although my father, men of the jury, wrote a will containing an inventory of all that he left, with instructions for letting the property, this will Aphobus never gave up to me, lest I should learn from it the value of the estate, and admitted possessing only those items which were so well known that he could not deny that he had them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>The will, according to his statement, contained these provisions: that Demophon should at once receive two talents, and should marry my sister when she should come of age (this would be in ten years); that Aphobus himself should have eighty minae with my mother, and the house to live in; and that Therippides should enjoy the interest on seventy minae until I should reach manhood. All the rest of the property left to me apart from these items, and the clause regarding the letting of the estate, he suppressed from the will, not thinking that it was to his interest that these matters should be made known in your court.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>However, since it was admitted by Aphobus himself that my father on his death-bed gave to each of these men such large sums of money, the jurymen at the former trial considered these admissions to be a proof of the size of the estate. For when a man gave out of his estate four talents and three thousand drachmae by way of marriage-portion and legacy, it was plain that he took these sums, not from a small estate, but from one (bequeathed to me) of more than double this amount.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The following passage up to the middle of the section is repeated almost verbatim from <bibl n="Dem. 27.45">Dem. 27.45</bibl></note> For it cannot be supposed that he would wish to leave me, his son, in poverty, and be eager further to enrich these men, who were already wealthy. No; it was because of the size of the estate left to me that he gave to Therippides the interest on seventy minae, and to Demophon that on the two talents—though he was not yet to marry my sister. These moneys it has been proved that Aphobus never gave over to me, nor even an amount slightly less. Part of it he said he had spent, part he had never received, part he knew nothing about, part was in the hands of so-and-so, part was in the house, and of part he could say anything except when and where he had paid it over.</p></div> 
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p rend="indent">As to his story of money left in the house I shall clearly prove to you that he is lying. This argument he speciously introduced, when it had become clear that the property was large and was unable to show that he had paid it back, in order that it might appear a reasonable inference that I was wrongfully seeking to recover what was already in my possession.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This passage repeats very closely the language of <bibl n="Dem. 27.55">Dem. 27.55-57</bibl></note> If my father had no confidence in these men it is plain that he would neither have entrusted them with the rest of his property, nor, if he had left this money in the way alleged, would he have told them of it. How, then, do they know about it? But, if he had confidence in them, he would not, I take it, have given into their hands the bulk of his property, and not have put them in charge of the rest. Nor would he have entrusted this remainder to my mother to keep and then have pledged her herself in marriage to this man, who was one of the guardians. For it is not reasonable that he should seek to make the money secure through her, and yet put one of the men whom he distrusted in control both of her and of it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>Furthermore, if there were any truth in all this, do you suppose that Aphobus would not have taken my mother to wife, bequeathed to him as she was by my father? He had already taken her marriage-portion—the eighty minae—as though he were going to marry her; but he subsequently married the daughter of Philonides of Melite, from motives of avarice, in order that, in addition to what he had received from us, he might get from him other eighty minae. But, if there had been four talents in the house, and in her custody, as he alleges, don’t you imagine he would have raced to get possession both of her and of them?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p>Would he have joined with his co-trustees in so shamefully plundering my visible property, which many of you knew had been left me, and have refrained, when he had the chance, from seizing a fund to the existence of which you would not be able to testify? Who can believe this? It is impossible, men of the jury; it is impossible. No; all the money which my father left was indeed buried on the day on which it came into the hands of these men; and the defendant, not being able to tell when and where he paid back any of it, makes use of these arguments, hoping that I may seem to be a rich man, and so meet with no compassion from you.</p></div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p rend="indent">I have many other charges to make against him, but I have not the right to speak of the injuries I myself have suffered, when the witness is in danger of losing his civic rights. Still I wish to read to you a challenge, for you will know, when you have heard it, that the testimony was true, and that Aphobus, who now declares that he demands <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> to be examined about all the matters involved in the suit, at first demanded him only in regard to a question of thirty minae; and, furthermore, that he has been put to no disadvantage because of the testimony.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>For I, in my desire to refute him in every particular, and in my attempt to make clear to you his tricks and his villainies, asked him how large the sum was regarding which he demanded to examine <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName>, as one who had knowledge of the facts. To this he replied falsely, that it was in regard to the whole amount. <q type="spoken">Well then,</q> said I, <q type="spoken">as to this I will give up to you for examination by torture the slave who has the copy of your challenge to me.</q></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">If, when I have given oath that you acknowledged the man to be free, and that you so testified against Demo, you will swear to the contrary with imprecations upon your daughter, I release to you the entire sum, for which you shall be shown by the examination of the slave to have at the first demanded <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName>; and the damages which you were condemned to pay shall be lessened by thus much—that is, by the amount in regard to which you demanded <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName>, to the end that you may be found to have been put to no disadvantage by the witnesses.</q></p></div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p>This challenge I made to him in the presence of many witnesses; but he said he could not accept it. Yet, if a man refused to give this judgement in his own favor, how can it be right for you, who are upon your oaths, to give credence to his words and convict the witnesses, and not rather to regard this man as the most shameless of humankind?</p><p rend="indent">To prove that my words are true, call the witnesses to these facts.</p><p rend="center"><label>The Witnesses</label></p></div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p rend="indent">Do not suppose that while I was ready to take this course, the witnesses did not hold the same opinion. No; they too were ready to place their children by their side, and in confirmation of the testimony they had given, to take an oath with imprecations upon them, if they swore falsely. But Aphobus did not see fit to allow an oath to be given either to them or to me. Instead, he rests his case on arguments subtly planned and on witnesses accustomed to perjury, and thinks thereby easily to mislead you.</p><p rend="indent">So take and read to the jury this deposition also.</p><p rend="center"><label>The Deposition</label></p></div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p rend="indent">How could one prove more clearly than I have proved that we are the object of a malicious charge; that the evidence brought forward against my opponent is true; and that his condemnation was just? I have shown that he refused to examine by torture the slave who wrote the testimony regarding the very things to which he had testified; that his brother, Aesius, has attested the facts which he on his part declares to be false; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p>that Aphobus himself has, at my summons, given against Demo,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Demo was not actually a trustee, but in <bibl n="Dem. 28.15">Dem. 28.15</bibl> it is stated that the elder Demosthenes had called him to be present, when, on his death-bed, he had entrusted his affairs and the guardianship of his children to the three named as trustees. He was the father of Demophon, and had very possibly taken part in the management of the trust. Another alternative suggestion is that Demosthenes may have instituted suit against Demo on quite other grounds of which we have no knowledge. This complicated problem is ably discussed by Calhoun, <title>l.c.</title> pp. 88 ff.</note> his uncle and co-trustee, the same testimony as the witnesses whom he is suing; that he refused to examine my women-servants as to the fact of <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> being a freeman; that my own mother was ready to give an oath regarding these matters with imprecations upon us; that he refused to accept for examination any one of my other slaves who knew all the circumstances better than <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> did; that he has not brought a charge of false witness against any one of those who testified that he had the money; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p>that he did not give over the will, nor let the house, although the laws so bade; and finally that he did not see fit to give an oath, after the witnesses and I myself had sworn, whereby he could have secured release to the amount of the sums regarding which he had demanded <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> for torture. By heaven, I certainly could think of no better way than this to establish these facts. Yet, plain as it is that he falsely attacks the witnesses; that he suffers no damage from the facts adduced; that he was justly condemned; he still tries to brazen it out.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>If it were not that he uses his present language after having at the outset been judged to be in the wrong by his own friends and by the arbitrator, there would be less reason to wonder at all this. But the fact is, that after persuading me to refer the matter to Archeneus and Dracontides and Phanus (the last of whom he is now suing on a charge of giving false witness), he rejected them (having heard them say that, if they decided on oath, they would condemn his conduct as guardian), and appeared before the official arbitrator, who, since Aphobus was unable to clear himself from the charges which I brought, gave judgement against him.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p>The jury, to whom he then appealed, having heard the case, gave the same decision that his own friends and the arbitrator had given, and fixed the damages at ten talents. This was not, heaven knows, because he had admitted <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> to be a freeman (for this was nothing to the point), but because, a fortune of fifteen talents having been left me, he had not let the property; because further, he with his co-trustees had the management of the estate for ten years, and agreed on behalf of me, a child, to pay a property-tax at the rate of five minae,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See notes <emph>b</emph> and <emph>c</emph> on <bibl n="Dem. 27.7">Dem. 27.7</bibl></note> the same rate at which Timotheus, son of <persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName>, and those possessing the largest fortunes were assessed; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>and because, after administering for so long an estate, on which he voluntarily chose to pay so high a tax, he turned over to me, as the amount due from him, property not even of the value of twenty minae, having together with those others robbed me of my whole estate, principal as well as interest. The jurymen, therefore, although they allowed interest on the whole property at the lowest rate, and not that at which estates are ordinarily let, found that these men had robbed me of more than thirty talents, and accordingly fixed the damages against Aphobus at ten talents.</p></div>
