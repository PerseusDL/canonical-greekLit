                <p>I invoke many blessings, men of the jury, first upon all of you, and then also
                    upon Solon, who established the law about the exchange of estates. For if he had
                    not clearly defined for us what is the first thing to be done by those who have
                    offered an exchange, and what the second, and so on in due order, I do not know
                    to what lengths the audacity of this man Phaenippus would have gone, when even
                    as it is, notwithstanding that the law prescribes all these things for us, he
                    has nevertheless disregarded its just provisions, and instead of giving me the
                    inventory of his property as the law prescribes within three days after he took
                    the oath, or if he did not wish to do so then, giving it at least on the sixth
                    day of the month Boedromion,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The month
                        Boedromion corresponds to the latter half of September and the prior half of
                        October.</note> which date was fixed upon at his request, and on which he
                    promised to deliver the inventory, he did neither the one thing nor the other,

            <div type="section" n="2">
                <p>but, showing contempt both for me and for the law, he has delivered his inventory
                    a month later, only two or three days before the case was brought into court,
                    and all the rest of the time has kept himself out of sight; and instead of
                    leaving untouched the seals which I had put upon the buildings, he went into the
                    country, opened the buildings, and carried off the barley and other things, just
                    as if the law had granted him the privilege of doing whatever he pleases, and
                    not what is right. </p>

                <p>For my part, men of the jury, I should be most happy to see myself enjoying the
                    material prosperity which was mine before, and remaining in the group of the
                    Three Hundred,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Each of the ten Athenian tribes
                        reported a list of its wealthiest citizens to the number of 120. The
                        resulting body of <date when="1200">1200</date> was divided into four groups
                        of 300 each (for the division into symmories, see note on vol. 1. p. 10),
                        and these groups, being made up of the richest citizens, naturally bore the
                        heaviest burdens, and in times of crisis might be called upon to advance the
                        entire amount of money required. See <bibl>Boeckh, <title>Publ.

                    common to all those who are engaged in mining works, and partly through having
                    met heavy reverses in my private business, I have lost my estate, and now at the
                    last must pay three talents to the state, a talent for each share (for I too was
                    a partner, as I wish I had not been, in the confiscated mine),<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">The mine had apparently been taken over by the state because
                        of non-payment of the rental, and to recover possession the lessees had to

                    compelled to try to substitute in my place a man who is not only richer than I
                    am now, but was richer even before my losses, and who has never borne any state
                    services, nor made any contribution to the state. </p>

            <div type="section" n="4">
                <p>I therefore beg of you all, men of the jury, that, if I prove that Phaenippus
                    here has both transgressed the just provisions of the law and is a richer man
                    than myself, you will succor me, and appoint him in the list of the Three
                    Hundred in my stead; for it is on this account that the laws every year provide
                    for the tendering of exchanges, because to enjoy unbroken prosperity is not wont
                    to be the permanent fortune of any large number of our citizens. But I will tell
                    you all that has been done regarding the exchange from the very beginning. </p>

                <p>On the second day of the month Metageitnion,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The
                        month Metageitnion corresponds to the latter half of August and the prior
                        half of September.</note> men of the jury, the generals appointed a court
                    for the Three Hundred for the tendering of exchanges. Among these I cited this
                    man Phaenippus as the law provides. After citing him, I took some of my friends
                    and relatives, and proceeded to his outlying farm at Cytherus.<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">Cytherus was a deme of the tribe Pandionis.</note> And first
                    I led them around the farm, the circuit of which was more than forty
                        stades,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The stade was roughly a
                        furlong.</note> and pointed out to them, and called them to witness in the
                    presence of Phaenippus, that there were no mortgage-pillars<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">Inscribed pillars were set up to indicate that a piece of
                        property was mortgaged. See <bibl n="Dem. 31">Dem. 31</bibl> passim.</note>
                    on the farm, and I bade Phaenippus, if he said there were, to declare it at once
                    and point them out to me, for fear some debt existing against the property might
                    be brought to light later on. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="6">
                <p>Then I sealed the buildings, and bade Phaenippus to proceed to my property. After
                    this I asked him where his threshed grain was, for by the gods and goddesses,
                    men of the jury, there were two threshing-floors there, each one of nearly a
                    plethron in extent.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, in diameter. The
                        speaker evidently expected to find large quantities of threshed grain, owing
                        to the size of the threshing floors. The plethron was about 100 feet.</note>
                    He answered me that some of the grain had been sold, and that some was stored
                    within. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="7">
                <p>Finally, to make a long story short, I stationed men inside to keep watch, and by
                    Zeus I gave strict orders to the ass-drivers and made them stop carrying off
                    timber from the farm (for in addition to the rest of his property Phaenippus has
                    also this very considerable source of revenue: six asses carry off wood the
                    whole year through, and he receives more than twelve drachmae a day). I forbade
                    the ass-drivers, as I said, to touch the wood, and after giving notice to
                    Phaenippus to attend the sacrifice,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Evidently
                        for the purpose of taking the oath.</note> as the law commands, I went back
                    to the city. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="8">
                <p>First, now, I will produce for you the depositions substantiating what I have
                    said, and then you shall hear the entire truth about the other aspects of the
                    case. For you will find, men of the jury, that this fellow Phaenippus began from
                    the very first day to act in utter disregard of right. I sealed the buildings,
                    as the law permitted me; he opened them. And he acknowledges that he removed the
                    seal, but does not acknowledge that he opened the door, as if men removed the
                    seals for any other purpose than to open the doors. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="9">
                <p>Then I had forbidden that wood should be carried off; he carried it off every day
                    except that on which I issued the order. There was no debt charged against the
                    farm; he now reports a number of debts. In a word, he does just what he pleases,
                    not what the laws bid him do.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Read the

                    the witnesses; but the things which he did after this have been offences, not

                <p>For although he had sworn on the eleventh of the month Boedromion to give me a

                    inventory shall be given within three days after one takes the oath, he came up
                    to me in front of the courtrooms with Polyeuctus of Crioa<note resp="Loeb"

                    secondly, to put off the declaration regarding the property for a few days only
                    (for he said he understood my position). </p>

            <div type="section" n="12">
                <p>I, on my part, thinking it was becoming to a good citizen who wished to avoid
                    quarrels not to rush headlong into court, was persuaded (for why should I
                    multiply words?) to consent that the conference regarding a settlement should
                    take place on the twenty-third of the month Boedromion, and the declaration
                    regarding the property on the twenty-fifth.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"

                    requests from me, Phaenippus did not present himself on either of these days;
                    instead, he now appears before you as one who has transgressed two laws instead
                    of one;—first, that which declares that the inventory shall be presented within
                    three days after that on which one takes the oath, and, secondly, that which
                    declares that mutual covenants, agreed upon in the presence of witnesses, shall
                    be binding. </p>

                    that agreed upon by the contending parties are equally binding? Why, very often,
                    although the thirtieth day is appointed by law, we fix upon another by mutual
                    agreement; and in all the offices the magistrates put off trials and judgements
                    for the contestants, when these have come to a mutual agreement; and if anyone
                    should hold that the agreement thus entered upon was to be of no effect, you
                    would despise him as a cheat without equal. </p>

            <div type="section" n="14">
                <p>Well then, Phaenippus, just as though the law enjoined that one should do nothing
                    that one had agreed to, from the day on which he promised to meet me for a
                    settlement and to give me an inventory of his property and receive from me one
                    of mine, never put in an appearance; but I, when I saw that he was paying no
                    heed to me or to the laws, gave in my inventory at the office of the generals,
                    whereas Phaenippus, as I said a moment ago, gave me a paper only the other day
                    with no other purpose than that he might appear to have given me his inventory,
                    but that I should be unable to make any use of its contents. </p>

                    brought a counter-charge against me that I am not rendering a just inventory of
                    my property; so easy is it for men of his stamp to make false statements before
                    you; and he complains of the oath which I took before filing the inventory,
                    asserting that I undertook to report all the rest of my property except that in
                    the mining-works;—as if to swear according to law were a matter for complaint!

                    will give a true and honest inventory of my property except that in the silver

                    freely:—I will surrender to him all my property including that in the mining
                    works, if he will hand over to me the farm alone free from all encumbrances as
                    it was when I first went to it with witnesses, and will replace as they were
                    before the grain and wine and the other things which he has carried away from
                    the buildings after removing the seals from the doors. </p>

                    confess it. But now I have lost all but a small portion of my gains. You, on the
                    contrary, since you sell from your farm your barley at a price of eighteen
                    drachmae and your wine at a price of twelve, are a rich man, naturally, for you

                    also take your turn and share for a little while in the class that performs
                    public services, since those engaged in mining have suffered reverses while you
                    farmers are prospering beyond what is your due. For a considerable time you have
                    enjoyed the income of two estates, that of your natural father, Callippus, and

                    This chariot he has included in his inventory to me, but of the barley and wine

                    No; far from it. For it is the duty of honest jurymen to give respite to those

                    and dwelling in my house, do not declare the marriage portion as a debt due to
