                <head>The Funeral Speech</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">After<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In this genre <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι</foreign>is unusable because aliens and women were present; there was no salutation for mixed audiences.</note> the State decreed that those who repose in this tomb, having acquitted themselves as brave men in the war, should have a public funeral, and appointed me to the duty of delivering over them the customary speech, I began straightway to study how they might receive their due tribute of praise; but as I studied and searched my mind the conclusion forced itself upon me that to speak as these dead deserve was one of those things that cannot be done. For, since they scorned the love of life that is inborn in all men and chose rather to die nobly than to live and look upon Greece in misfortune, how can they have failed to leave behind them a record of valor surpassing all power of words to express? Nevertheless I propose to treat the theme in the same vein as those who have previously spoken in this place from time to time.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">That the State seriously concerns itself with those who die in battle it is possible to infer both from these rites in general and, in particular, from this law in accordance with which it chooses the speaker at our public funerals. For knowing that among good men the acquisition of wealth and the enjoyment of the pleasures that go with living are scorned,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A commonplace of funeral speeches: <bibl n="Thuc. 2.42.4">Thuc. 2.42.4</bibl>.</note> and that their whole desire is for virtue and words of praise, the citizens were of the opinion that we ought to honor them with such eulogies as would most certainly secure them in death the glory they had won while living.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now, if it were my view that, of those qualities that constitute virtue, courage alone was their possession, I might praise this and be done with the speaking, but since it fell to their lot also to have been nobly born and strictly brought up and to have lived with lofty ideals, because of all which they had every reason to be good men, I should be ashamed if I were found to have passed over any of these topics.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Blass censures the author for not following in the sequel a threefold division of his theme, which is here implied and may be found in <bibl n="Plat. Menex. 237a">Plat. Menex. 237 a-b</bibl>: nobility of birth, upbringing and education, and exploits. These topics are treated, but not consecutively. Peculiar to this speech is the passage on the ten tribes, <bibl n="Dem. 60.27">Dem. 60.27-32</bibl>.</note> I shall begin from the origin of their race.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Blass compares Isocrates, <title>Helen</title>16 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν μὲν οὖν ἀρχὴν τοῦ λόγου ποιήσομαι τοιαύτην τοῦ γένους αὐτῆς</foreign>, (<bibl n="Isoc. 10.16">Isoc. 10.16</bibl>).</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">The nobility of birth of these men has been acknowledged from time immemorial by all mankind. For it is possible for them and for each one of their remote ancestors man by man to trace back their being, not only to a physical father, but also to this land of theirs as a whole, a common possession, of which they are acknowledged to be the indigenous children.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This topic appears in <bibl n="Plat. Menex. 237b">Plat. Menex. 237 b-c</bibl>.</note> For alone of all mankind they settled the very land from which they were born and handed it down to their descendants, so that justly one may assume that those who came as migrants into their cities and are denominated citizens of the same are comparable to adopted children; but these men are citizens of their native land by right of legitimate birth.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This topic appears in <bibl n="Hyp. 6.7">Hyp. Epitaph. 7</bibl>.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>In my view also the fact that the fruits of the earth by which men live were first manifest among us,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">According to tradition the olive was created by the goddess Athena, while the culture of grain, especially wheat and barley, was established by Demeter, whose mysteries were celebrated at Eleusis close to Athens.</note> even apart from their being a superlative boon to all men, constitutes an acknowledged proof that this land is the mother of our ancestors. For all things that bring forth young produce at the same time nutriment out of the organism itself<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, <q type="translation">by a law of nature herself.</q></note> for those that are born. This very thing has been done by this land.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This topic is treated in more detail in <bibl n="Plat. Menex. 237e">Plat. Menex. 237e-238b</bibl>.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">Such is the pride of birth that belongs to the ancestors of these men throughout the ages. As for Courage and the other elements of virtue, I shrink from rehearsing the whole story, being on my guard for fear an untimely length shall attach to my speech ,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Another commonplace: <bibl n="Hyp. 4">Hyp. 4</bibl> expresses a similar fear.</note> but such facts as it is worth while even for those who are familiar with them to recall to mind and most profitable for the inexperienced to hear,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Thuc. 2.36.4">Thuc. 2.36.4</bibl> may be compared.</note> events of great power to inspire and calling for no tedious length of speech, these I shall endeavor to rehearse in summary fashion.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hyp. 5">Hyp. 5 </bibl> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ κεφαλαίου</foreign>.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>For the ancestors of this present generation, both their fathers and those who bore the names of these men in time past, by which they are recognized by those of our race, never at any time wronged any man, whether Greek or barbarian, but it was their pride, in addition to all their other good qualities, to be true gentlemen and supremely just, and in defending themselves they accomplished a long list of noble deeds.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>They so prevailed over the invading host of the Amazons as to expel them beyond the Phasis, and the host of Eumolpus and of many another foeman they drove not only out of their own land but also from the lands of all the other Greeks—invaders whom all those dwelling on our front to the westward neither withstood nor possessed the power to halt.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The female warriors known as Amazons were repelled by Theseus. The Phasis River in Colchis, now the Rion, was the legendary boundary between Europe and Asia. Eumolpus invaded Greece from Thrace but was halted by Erechtheus at Eleusis. The route to all parts of the mainland issued from Athens on the west side.</note> Moreover, they were styled the saviors of the sons of Heracles, who himself was the savior of the rest of mankind, when they arrived in this land as suppliants, fleeing before Eurystheus. In addition to all these and many other noble deeds they refused to suffer the lawful rites of the departed to be treated with despite when Creon forbade the burial of <q type="soCalled">the seven against Thebes.</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This phrase became proverbial as the title of a drama by Aeschylus. Theseus, king of Athens, gave aid to the suppliant wives of the Argive heroes when Creon, king of Thebes, refused burial to their slain husbands: <bibl n="Eur. Supp. 1">Eur. Supp.</bibl></note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">Now, omitting mention of many exploits that are classed as myths, I have recalled to mind the above-mentioned, each of which affords so many charming themes that our writers of poetry, whether recited or sung,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The distinction is between epic and dramatic poetry, which was recited, and odes such as those of Pindar, and dithyrambs, which were sung to musical accompaniment.</note> and many historians, have made the deeds of those men the subjects of their respective arts; at the present time I shall mention the following deeds, which, though in point of merit they are no whit inferior to the former, still, through being closer in point of time, have not yet found their way into poetry or even been exalted to epic rank.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>Those men single-handed twice repulsed by land and sea the expedition assembled out of the whole of Asia,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">King Darius of Persia was repulsed at Marathon, 490, and Xerxes at Salamis, <date when="-0480">480</date> B.C. The Persian wars are discussed at length in <bibl n="Plat. Menex. 239d">Plat. Menex. 239d ff.</bibl> </note> and at their individual risks established themselves as the authors of the joint salvation of all the Greeks. And though what I shall say next has been said before by many another, still even at this date those dead must not be deprived of their just and excellent praise. For I say that with good reason those men might be judged so far superior to those who campaigned against Troy, that the latter, the foremost princes out of the whole of Greece, with difficulty captured a single stronghold of Asia after besieging it for ten years,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Blass notes this sentiment in <bibl n="Isoc. 4.83">Isoc. 4.83</bibl>. It is found also in <bibl n="Hyp. 6.35">Hyp. 35</bibl>.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>whereas those men single-handed not only repulsed a host assembled from an entire continent, which had already subdued all other lands, but also inflicted punishment for the wrong done the rest of the Greeks. Furthermore, checking all acts of selfish aggrandisement among the Greeks themselves, assigning themselves to each station where justice was arrayed, they went on bearing the brunt of all dangers that chanced to arise until the lapse of time brings us to the generation now living.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">Let no one think I have enumerated this list of achievements because I am at a loss what to say about each of them; for if I were the most helpless of all men in discovering what it becomes me to say, the sheer virtue of those dead reveals what sentiments lie to hand and are easy to rehearse. It is my intention, however, after calling to mind their noble birth and the magnificent things done by their ancestors, with all speed to link my speech with the deeds of these dead, to the end that, just as they were akin in the flesh, so I may make the words of praise spoken over them to apply to both alike. I assume that this would be gratifying not only to the ancestors but, best of all, to both them and these dead, if they should come to share one another’s merit not only by virtue of birth but also by reason of our words of praise.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">In the meantime it is necessary to interrupt my discourse for a moment, before declaring the deeds of these men, to solicit the goodwill of those born outside this race who have accompanied us to the tomb.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The welcome extended to aliens at the public funerals is mentioned in <bibl n="Thuc. 2.34.4">Thuc. 2.34.4</bibl>. Pericles recognizes their presence, <bibl n="Thuc. 36.4">Thuc. 36.4</bibl>.</note> For if I had been appointed to do honor to this burial through expenditure of money or by providing some different kind of a spectacle consisting of equestrian or gymnastic contests, the greater my zeal and the more lavish my expenditure in preparing such spectacles, the better I should have been thought to have done my duty. Having been chosen, however, to extol these men in a speech, unless I have the sympathy of my hearers, I fear that because of my eagerness I may effect the very opposite of what I ought.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>For wealth and speed of foot and strength of body and all other such things have their rewards self-assured to their possessors, and in those fields they win who have the luck, even if not one of the others wishes their success. On the other hand, the persuasiveness of words depends upon the goodwill of the hearers, and with the help of this, even if the eloquence be moderate, it reaps glory and gains favor, but lacking this help, even if it be surpassingly good, it is thwarted by those who hear.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Blass compares <bibl n="Dem. 18.277">Dem. 18.277</bibl>, but the parallel is not precise.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p rend="indent">Now to resume my theme: though many deeds of these men are at hand because of which they will be justly eulogized, I am at a loss what to mention first when I come face to face with the facts. For thronging into my mind as they do, all at one and the same time, it becomes difficult to make a choice among them. I shall endeavor, however, to maintain the same order of topics in my speech as marked the course of the lives of these men.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>From the beginning these men were outstanding in all the activities that formed their schooling, engaging in the exercises that became each stage of life, causing gratification to all who had claim to it—parents, friends, kinsmen. Therefore, just as if recognizing footprints, the memory of those who were near and dear to them now turns to these men every hour in fond recollection, finding many a reminder of occasions when they knew in their hearts that these were lads of surpassing worth.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>Arrived at manhood they rendered their innate nobility known, not only to their fellow-citizens, but to all men. For of all virtue, I say, and I repeat it, the beginning is understanding and the fulfillment is courage; by the one it is judged what ought to be done and by the other this is carried to success.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Kennedy cites <bibl n="Cic. Sest. 40.86">Cicero Pro Sestio 40.86</bibl> <quote xml:lang="lat">hoc sentire prudentiae est, facere fortitudinis.</quote></note> In both these qualities these men were distinctly superior; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>for if ever a danger affecting all the Greeks was brewing, these were the first to foresee it, and time and again they challenged the rest to save the situation. This action is a demonstration of sound judgement joined with public spirit. Although, again, there was much folly among the Greeks, not unmixed with slackness,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">By <q type="metioned">slackness</q> is meant the acceptance of Macedonian bribes, mentioned by <bibl n="Hyp. 6.10">Hyp. 10</bibl>; Blass compares <bibl n="Dem. 18.20">Dem. 18.20</bibl>, where <q type="translation">folly</q> is used as a euphemism for <q type="mentioned">slackness.</q></note> a folly which failed to foresee some dangers and feigned not to see others at a time when it was possible to avert these misfortunes without sacrificing safety, nevertheless, when they did hearken and evinced willingness to do their duty,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The attitude of the Greek states toward the aggressions of Philip of Macedon may be compared to that of the small democratic states of Europe toward Germany before the war of <date from="1939" to="1945">1939</date>-1945. By his <title>Olynthiacs</title> (<bibl n="Dem. 1">Dem. 1-3</bibl>) and <title>Phillippics</title>(<bibl n="Dem. 4">Dem. 4</bibl>, <bibl n="Dem. 6">Dem. 6</bibl>, <bibl n="Dem. 9">Dem. 9</bibl>, <bibl n="Dem. 10">Dem. 10</bibl>) Demosthenes tried to arouse and unite them but with little success, until the year <date when="-0338">338</date> B.C., when he achieved his great diplomatic triumph in uniting Thebes with Athens, ancient rivals.</note> these men did not bear a grudge but stepping forward and eagerly offering their all, bodies, money, and allies, they entered upon the ordeal of the contest, in which they were not sparing even of their lives.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p rend="indent">Of necessity it happens, when a battle takes place,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The particular reference is to the battle of Chaeronea, <date when="-0338">338</date> B.C., where the Greeks were defeated by Philip of Macedon.</note> that the one side is beaten and the other victorious; but I should not hesitate to assert that in my judgement the men who die at the post of duty on either side do not share the defeat but are both alike victors. For the mastery among the survivors is decided as the deity disposes, but that which each was in duty bound to contribute to this end, every man who has kept his post in battle has done. But if, as a mortal being, he meets his doom, what he has suffered is an incident caused by chance, but in spirit he remains unconquered by his opponents.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Blass notes this sentiment in <bibl n="Dem. 18.208">Dem. 18.208</bibl>, and in <bibl n="Isoc. 4.92">Isoc. 4.92</bibl>. It is subsidiary to the recognition of the supremacy of the deity, fate or fortune, <bibl n="Dem. 18.192">Dem. 18.192</bibl>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.207">Dem. 18.207</bibl>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.208">Dem. 18.208</bibl>. To commemorate the valor of the fallen Thebans a monumental seated lion was erected facing in the direction of the enemy. It is still extant.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>It is my judgement, therefore, that we have to thank the valor of these men, along with the folly of our opponents, that our enemies did not set foot upon our land; because, every man of them having had proof of their mettle, those who there engaged them on that occasion had no wish to confront in battle a second time the kinsmen of those men, suspecting that, although they would confront men of the same breed, they were not likely to find the fortune of battle so kind.</p> <p rend="indent">Not the least reason for believing that this was their state of mind is afforded by the peace that was made; for it is impossible to cite a more plausible or more creditable reason than that the master of our opponents, astounded at the valor of these who died, chose rather to be friendly toward their kinsmen than once more to assume the risk of all his fortunes.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Philip exacted no vengeance after his victory; Attica was not invaded. The Greek states retained the right of self-government and became allies, not subjects, of the victor.</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>I believe also that if someone were to ask those in the opposite ranks whether they thought they had won by their own deeds of valor or by a startling and cruel turn of fortune and by the skill and daring of their own commander, not one of them would be so shameless or audacious as to claim credit for what happened. Furthermore, in contests of which the deity, the master of all, has disposed the outcome as it chose, it is necessary of course to acquit all others, being but human, of the charge of cowardice, but when it comes to the means by which the leader of our opponents prevailed over those appointed to the command of our army, no one could justly locate the cause in the rank and file of either the enemy or ourselves.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>But if, after all, there is any human being who might rightly lay a charge concerning the issue of that battle, he would with good reason advance it against those of the Thebans who were appointed to this command,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Philip seems to have deceived the Athenians by a feigned retreat while throwing his strongest troops against the Thebans. This stratagem broke the line and decided the battle. The Theban general Theagenes and his colleagues seem to have been no more to blame than the rest.</note> nor could anyone rightly lay blame upon the rank and file of either the Thebans or ourselves. Those men, receiving command of a military force that would neither brook defeat nor make excuse and had an emulous zest for glory, made the right use of none of these.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>As for the other questions touching this campaign, each individual is at liberty to draw conclusions according to his judgement, but what has become manifest to all living men alike is this—that, in effect, the freedom of the whole Greek world was being preserved in the souls of these men. At any rate, since fate removed them, not one of those remaining has made a stand against the foe. While I desire that my words may be free from offence, it seems to me that if one should declare that the valor of these men was the very life of Greece he would speak the truth; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>for at one and the same time their spirits were separated from their dear bodies and the self-esteem of Greece was taken from her. We shall therefore seem guilty perhaps of a bold exaggeration, but still it must be uttered: for just as, if the light of day were removed out of this universe of ours,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Kennedy quotes <bibl n="Cic. Amic. 13.47 ">Cicero De Amic. 13.47</bibl> <quote xml:lang="lat">solem enim e mundo tollere videntur qui amicitiam e vita tollunt.</quote> According to <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 1.7">Aristot. Rh. 1.7</bibl> and <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 3.10">Aristot. 3.10</bibl>, Pericles had once said in a funeral speech it was <q type="spoken">as if the spring had been taken out of the year.</q></note> all the remnant of life would be harsh and irksome, so, now that these men have been taken from us, all the old-time ambition of the Greeks is sunk in gloom and profound obscurity.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p rend="indent">While it stands to reason that many influences helped to make them what they were, not least was their virtue ascribable to our form of government.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This topic is treated in <bibl n="Plat. Menex. 238b">Plat. Menex. 238b-239d</bibl>. Blass compares <bibl n="Dem. 20.108">Dem. 20.108</bibl>, but the similarity is not impressive.</note> For though absolute governments dominated by a few create fear in their citizens, they fail to awaken the sense of shame. Consequently, when the test of war comes, everyone lightheartedly proceeds to save himself, knowing full well that if only he succeeds in appeasing his masters by presents or any other civility whatsoever, even though he becomes guilty of the most revolting conduct, only slight reproach will attach to him thereafter.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>Democracies, however, possess many other just and noble features, to which right-minded men should hold fast, and in particular it is impossible to deter freedom of speech, which depends upon speaking the truth, from exposing the truth. For neither is it possible for those who commit a shameful act to appease all the citizens,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Under an oligarchy, the speaker means, it is possible for the wrongdoer to seal the mouths of the small ruling clique by means of bribes, but under a democracy it is impossible to buy the silence of thousands of citizens. The reference is to oligarchic governments set up by the Spartans in subject states. Pericles praised the Athenian form of government as against the Spartan, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.37">Thuc. 2.37-39</bibl>.</note> so that even the lone individual, uttering the deserved reproach, makes the guilty wince: for even those who would never speak an accusing word themselves are pleased at hearing the same, provided another utters it.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p rend="indent">The considerations that actuated these men one and all to choose to die nobly have now been enumerated,—birth, education, habituation to high standards of conduct, and the underlying principles of our form of government in general. The incentives that challenged them severally to be valiant men, depending upon the tribes to which they belonged, I shall next relate.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The list which here begins is our chief authority for the names and order of precedence of the ten Athenian tribes as established by Cleisthenes in <date when="-0508">508</date> B.C. The particular myths that suit the context, however, are for the most part obscure and of relatively recent origin. For example, the older legends speak of but one daughter of Erechtheus as being sacrificed. The later version is known to <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 1.48.116">Cicero Tusc. Disp. 1.48.116</bibl>.</note> All the Erechtheidae were well aware that Erechtheus, from whom they have their name, for the salvation of this land gave his own daughters, whom they call Hyacinthides, to certain death, and so extinguished his race. Therefore they regarded it as shameful, after a being born of immortal gods had sacrificed everything for the liberation of his native land, that they themselves should have been found to have placed a higher value upon a mortal body than upon immortal glory.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hyp. 6.24">Hyp. 24</bibl> reads in part <foreign xml:lang="grc">θνητοῦ σώματος ἀθάνατον δόξαν ἐκτήσαντο</foreign>, <q type="translation">gained immortal glory at the price of a mortal body.</q></note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>Neither were the Aegeidae ignorant that Theseus, the son of Aegeus, for the first time established equality in the State.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">According to <bibl n="Plut. Thes. 25">Plut. Thes. 25</bibl>, it was equality between newcomers and natives that Theseus established; the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσονομία</foreign> usually means equality before the law and is almost a synonym for democracy.</note> They thought it, therefore, a dreadful thing to be false to the principles of that ancestor, and they preferred to be dead rather than through love of life to survive among the Greeks with this equality lost. The Pandionidae had inherited the tradition of Procne and Philomela, the daughters of Pandion, who took vengeance on Tereus for his crime against themselves.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Procne is said to have murdered her own son Itys and to have served his flesh to her husband Tereus in revenge for his treachery to herself and his cruelty to Philomela. It is curious that the speaker seems less shocked by this crime than by the innocent tale of Alope, <bibl n="Dem. 60.31">Dem. 60.31</bibl>, below.</note> Therefore they decided that life was not worth living unless they, akin by race, should have proved themselves to possess equal spirit with those women, when confronted by the outrage they saw being committed against Greece.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p rend="indent">The Leontidae had heard the stories related of the daughters of Leo, how they offered themselves to the citizens as a sacrifice for their country’s sake. When, therefore, such courage was displayed by those women, they looked upon it as a heinous thing if they, being men, should have proved to possess less of manhood. The Acamantidae did not fail to recall the epics in which Homer says that Acamas sailed for Troy for the sake of his mother Aethra.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Aethra is mentioned in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.144">Hom. Il. 3.144</bibl>, but the rest of the story is not Homeric. This Acamas is unknown to Homer, though he mentions two other individuals of the same name. It was later myths that told of the rescue of Aethra after the fall of Troy by her two grandsons, not sons, Acamas and Demophon.</note> Now, since he braved every danger for the sake of saving his own mother, how were these men not bound to face every danger for the sake of saving their parents one and all at home?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>It did not escape the Oeneidae that Semele was the daughter of Cadmus, and of her was born one whom it would be sacrilegious to name at this tomb,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Dionysus, or Bacchus, god of wine, who, as an Olympian, could not associate with death.</note> and by him Oeneus was begotten, who was called the founder of their race.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Two demes in Attica were named Oenoe, which was sufficient to justify the invention of a hero Oeneus, but he is not to be confused with the Homeric hero of this name who was associated with Calydon in Aetolia and with Argos. The word means <q type="gloss">wineman,</q> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνος</foreign>. At Athens the anniversary of this hero fell in the month Gamelion, like the Lenaea of Dionysus. It was natural, therefore, to call him the son of the god, but the relationship plays no part in recorded myths.</note> Since the danger in question was common to both States, on behalf of both they thought themselves bound to endure any Anguish to the end.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The suggestion is that the Oeneidae would have felt equally bound to fight on behalf of Thebes, of which the founder was Cadmus, and on behalf of Athens, one of whose heroes was Oeneus, great-grandson of Cadmus. This is the weakest link in this series.</note> The Cecropidae were well aware that their founder was reputed to have been part dragon, part human, for no other reason than this, that in understanding he was like a man, in strength like a dragon. So they assumed that their duty was to perform feats worthy of both.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>The Hippothoontidae bore in mind the marriage of Alope, from which Hippothoon was born, and they knew also who their founder was; about these matters—to avoid impropriety on an occasion like this<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Alope’s son was said to have been twice exposed, and twice rescued and suckled by a mare. The use of mare’s milk as a food prevailed among the Scythians, as the Greeks knew well from their colonists in the region of the Black Sea, if not from <bibl n="Hdt. 4.2">Hdt. 4.2</bibl>; Gylon, grandfather of Demosthenes, had lived in the Crimea and was said to have married a Thracian wife. The orator was sometimes twitted by his opponents about his Thracian blood. He may have been sensitive. Consequently the attitude here revealed might be construed as evidence for the genuineness of the speech.</note> I forbear to speak plainly—they thought it was their duty to be seen performing deeds worthy of these ancestors. It did not escape the Aeantidae that Ajax, robbed of the prize of valor, did not consider his own life worth living.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Ajax, worsted by Odysseus in a contest for possession of the arms of Achilles, was said to have slain himself: <bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.541">Hom. Od. 11.541-567</bibl>; the story of his madness and of slaughtering flocks and herds as if they were his enemies is not Homeric: <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 1">Soph. Aj.</bibl></note> When, therefore, the god was giving to another the prize of valor, at once they thought they must die trying to repel their foes so as to suffer no disgrace to themselves. The Antiochidae were not unmindful that Antiochus was the son of Heracles.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The mother of Antiochus was Meda, daughter of Phylas, king of the Dryopes, but the story was unimportant and little known.</note> They concluded therefore that they must either live worthily of their heritage or die nobly.</p></div>
