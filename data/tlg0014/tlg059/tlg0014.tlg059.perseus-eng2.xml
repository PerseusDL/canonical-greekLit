                        Neaera, and to come before you. We have suffered grievous wrongs at the
                        hands of Stephanus and have been brought by him into the most extreme peril,
                        I mean my father-in-law, myself, my sister, and my wife; so that I shall
                        enter upon this trial, not as an aggressor, but as one seeking vengeance.
                        For Stephanus was the one who began our quarrel without ever having been
                        wronged by us in word or deed. I wish at the outset to state before you the
                        wrongs which we have suffered at this hands, in order that you may feel more
                        indulgence for me as I seek to defend myself and to show you into what
                        extreme danger we were brought by him of losing our country and our civic

                        should be used for military purposes or for public spectacles. For the laws
                        prescribed that, when there was war, the funds remaining over from state
                        expenditures should be devoted to military purposes, and Apollodorus
                        believed that the people ought to have power to do what they pleased with
                        their own; and he had sworn that, as member of the senate, he would act for
                        the best interests of the Athenian people, as you all bore witness at that

                        anywhere spoken of, it is acknowledged by all that Apollodorus gave the best
                        advice, and was unjustly treated. It is, therefore, upon the one who by his
                        arguments deceived the jurors that your wrath should fall, not upon those

                        were foreign to the indictment won a verdict against the decree.</p>

                        penalty, although we begged him to make concessions, he would not listen to
                        us, but fixed the fine at fifteen talents in order to deprive Apollodorus
                        and his children of their civic rights, and to bring my sister and all of us
                        into extremest distress and utter destitution. </p>

                        doubled and Apollodorus would have been inscribed as owing thirty talents to
                        the treasury, all the property that he has would have been scheduled as
                        belonging to the state, and upon its being sold Apollodorus himself and his
                        children and his wife and all of us would have been reduced to extremest

                        magnitude, you see, were the calamities which Stephanus was bringing upon us
                        all without ever having been wronged by us in any respect. To the jurors,
                        therefore, who at that time decided the matter I am deeply grateful for this
                        at least, that they did not suffer Apollodorus to be utterly ruined, but
                        fixed the amount of the fine at one talent, so that he was able to discharge
                        the debt, although with difficulty. With good reason, then, have we
                        undertaken to pay Stephanus back in the same coin. </p>

                        himself and his race and his house, affirming matters which had never taken
                        place, which he had never seen or heard from any human being. However, since

                        but she charged higher fees from those who sought her favors as being now a
                        respectable woman living with her husband. Stephanus, on his part, joined
                        with her in extorting blackmail. If he found as a lover of Neaera any young
                        alien rich and without experience, he would lock him up as caught in

                        their establishment were large; for they had to support both him and her and
                        three children whom she had brought with her, and two female servants and a
                        male house-servant; and besides Neaera had become accustomed to live

                        pettifogger, one of those who stand beside the platform and shout, who
                        prefer indictments and informations for hire, and who let their names be

                        she is an alien and is guilty of grievous wrongs against you and of impiety

                <div n="44" type="section">
                    <p>for I would have you know that Stephanus himself deserves to pay no less
                        heavy a penalty than Neaera here, but even one far heavier, and that he is
                        far more guilty, seeing that, while professing to be an Athenian, he treats
                        you and your laws and the gods with such utter contempt that he cannot bring
                        himself to keep quiet even for shame at the wrongs he has himself committed,
                        but by bringing baseless charges against me and against others he has caused
                        my colleague to bring against him and against this woman a charge so
                        grievous that it necessitates inquiry being made into her origin, and his
                        own profligacy being brought to light. </p>

                    <p>So, then, Phrynion brought suit against Stephanus for having taken this woman

                        which Neaera had brought with her from Phrynion’s house. Their friends,

                        maid-servants; for these had been bought for the use of the woman herself;

                        sick. He got into a dreadful condition and became utterly helpless. There
                        was an old quarrel between him and his own relatives, toward whom he
                        cherished anger and hatred; and besides he was childless. Being cajoled,

                        child whom the daughter of this woman Neaera had borne after she was sent
                        away from his house in a state of pregnancy, after he had learned that she
                        was the daughter, not of Stephanus, but of Neaera, and was angered at their

                        did not wish his relatives to get his property nor himself to die childless,
                        so he adopted this boy and received him back into his house. That he would

                        Diphilus. Let this, therefore, be a proof to you that he took back the

                        betrothed to Theogenes when the latter was king, as his own daughter,
                        performed these rites, and administered the oath to the venerable

                        other matters also is of high worth to the city in what pertains to piety,
                        forthwith undertook an inquiry as to who this wife of Theogenes was and
                        established the truth; and being deeply concerned for the sanctity of the
                        rites, the council was for imposing upon Theogenes the highest fine in its
                        power, but in secret and with due regard for appearances; for they have not
                        the power to punish any of the Athenians as they see fit. </p>

                        of such character and having permitted her to administer on the city’s
                        behalf the rites that none may name, Theogenes besought them with prayers
                        and entreaties, declaring that he did not know that she was the daughter of
                        Neaera, but that he had been deceived by Stephanus, and had married her
                        according to law as being the latter’s legitimate daughter; and that it was
                        because of his own inexperience in affairs and the guilelessness of his
                        character that he had made Stephanus his assessor to attend to the business
                        of his office; for he considered him a friend, and on that account had
                        become his son-in-law. </p>

                        the daughter, not of Stephanus, but of Neaera. If I do this, then let my
                        statement that I was deceived be accepted as true; but, if I fail to do it,

                        and in the belief that he had really been deceived by Stephanus, refrained
                        from action. And Theogenes immediately on coming down from the Areopagus
                        cast out of his house the woman, the daughter of this Neaera, and expelled
                        this man Stephanus, who had deceived him, from the board of magistrates.

                    <p>Now take, please, the law bearing upon these matters, and read it; for I
                        would have you know that a woman of her character, who has done what she has
                        done, ought not only to have kept aloof from these sacred rites, to have
                        abstained from beholding them, from offering sacrifices, and from performing
                        on the city’s behalf any of the ancestral rites which usage demands, but
                        that she should have been excluded also from all other religious ceremonials
                        in Athens. For a woman who has been taken in adultery is not permitted to
                        attend any of the public sacrifices, although the laws have given both to
                        the alien woman and the slave the right to attend these, whether to view the
                        spectacle or to offer prayer. </p>

                    <p>No; it is to these women alone that the law denies entrance to our public
                        sacrifices, to these, I mean, who have been taken in adultery; and if they
                        do attend them and defy the law, any person whatsoever may at will inflict
                        upon them any sort of punishment, save only death, and that with impunity;
                        and the law has given the right of punishing these women to any person who
                        happens to meet with them. It is for this reason that the law has declared
                        that such a woman may suffer any outrage short of death without the right of
                        seeking redress before any tribunal whatsoever, that our sanctuaries may be
                        kept free from all pollution and profanation, and that our women may be
                        inspired with a fear sufficient to make them live soberly, and avoid all
                        vice, and, as their duty is, to keep to their household tasks. For it
                        teaches them that, if a woman is guilty of any such sin, she will be an
                        outcast from her husband’s home and from the sanctuaries of the city. </p>

                        religious rites. For the civic body of Athens, although it has supreme
                        authority over all things in the state, and it is in its power to do
                        whatsoever it pleases, yet regarded the gift of Athenian citizenship as so
                        honorable and so sacred a thing that it enacted in its own restraint laws to
                        which it must conform, when it wishes to create a citizen—laws which now
                        have been dragged through the mire by Stephanus and those who contract
                        marriages of this sort. </p>

                        which are granted to the benefactors of the state.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, there is a law imposed upon the people forbidding them to
                        bestow Athenian citizenship upon any man who does not deserve it because of
                        distinguished services to the Athenian people. In the next place, when the
                        civic body has been thus convinced and bestows the gift, it does not permit
                        the adoption to become valid, unless in the next ensuing assembly more than
                        six thousand Athenians confirm it by a secret ballot. </p>

                        one about to be so adopted is worthy of the gift. Furthermore, after this
                        the law permits to any Athenian who wishes to prefer it an indictment for
                        illegality against the candidate, and he may come into court and prove that
                        the person in question is not worthy of the gift, but has been made a
                        citizen contrary to the laws. </p>

                        that the person who had received the gift was proved to be unworthy of it,
                        and the court took it back. To review the many cases in ancient times would
                        be a long task; I will mention only those which you all remember: Peitholas
                        the Thessalian, and Apollonides the Olynthian, after having been made
                        citizens by the people, were deprived of the gift by the court. </p>

                    <p>These are not events of long ago of which you might be ignorant.</p>
                    <p>However, although the laws regarding citizenship and the steps that must be
                        taken before one may become an Athenian are so admirably and so securely
                        established, there is yet another law which has been enacted in addition to
                        all these, and this law is of paramount validity; such great precautions
                        have the people taken in the interest of themselves and of the gods, to the
                        end that the sacrifices on the state’s behalf may be offered in conformity
                        with religious usage. For in the case of all those whom the Athenian people
                        may make citizens, the law expressly forbids that they should be eligible to
                        the office of the nine archons or to hold any priesthood; but their
                        descendants are allowed by the people to share in all civic rights, though
                        the proviso is added: if they are born from an Athenian woman who was
                        betrothed according to the law. </p>

                        friends to the people of Athens. For from all this you will know that the

                        trial, so that you all learned who she was and what acts of impiety she had
                        committed, the crimes were her own, and the state was merely guilty of
                        neglect; and some of you knew nothing of the matter, and others learning of
                        it expressed their indignation in words but in fact had no means of dealing
                        with her, seeing that nobody brought her to trial or gave an opportunity of
                        casting a vote regarding her. But now that you all know the facts and have
                        got her in your own hands, and have the power to punish her, the sin against
                        the gods becomes your own, if you fail to do so. </p>

                        Will it be that this woman Neaera is of Athenian birth, and that she lives
                        as his wife with Stephanus in accordance with the laws? But testimony has
                        been offered, showing that she is a courtesan, and has been the slave of
                        Nicaretê. Or will they claim that she is not his wife, but that he keeps her
                        in his house as a concubine? Yet the woman’s sons, by having been introduced
                        to the clansmen by Stephanus, and her daughter, by having been given in
                        marriage to an Athenian husband, prove beyond question that he keeps her as
                        his wife. </p>

                <div n="119" type="section">
                    <p>I think, therefore, that neither Stephanus himself nor anyone on his behalf
                        will succeed in proving that the charges and the testimony are false—that,
                        in short, this Neaera is an Athenian woman. But I hear that he is going to
                        set up some such defense as this—that he is keeping her, not as a wife, but
                        as a mistress, and that the children are not hers, but were born to him by
                        another woman, an Athenian and a relative of his, whom he will assert that
                        he married at a earlier date. </p>

                        have been enabled to know the whole truth: I proposed that he should deliver

                        loyally with Neaera when she came to Stephanus from Megara, and those whom
                        she purchased subsequently, while living with him, Xennis and Drosis; </p>

                <div n="121" type="section">
                    <p>for these women know perfectly well that Proxenus, who died, Ariston, who is
                        still living, and Antidorides the runner, and Phano, formerly called
                        Strybel, who married Theogenes, the king, are children of Neaera. And if it
                        should appear from the torture that this man Stephanus had married an
                        Athenian wife and that these children were borne to him, not by Neaera, but
                        by another woman who was an Athenian, I offered to withdraw from the case
                        and to prevent this indictment from coming into court. </p>

                <div n="122" type="section">
                    <p>For this is what living with a woman as one’s wife means—to have children by

                        and to betroth the daughters to husbands as one’s own. Mistresses we keep
                        for the sake of pleasure, concubines for the daily care of our persons, but
                        wives to bear us legitimate children and to be faithful guardians of our
                        households. If, therefore, Stephanus had previously married an Athenian
                        woman, and these children are hers and not Neaera’s, he could have shown it
                        by the most certain evidence, by delivering up these women-servants for the

                        you will be wholly false, and he will himself prove that he has no sound
                        argument to advance, inasmuch as he has refused to deliver up for the
                        torture the women-servants whom I demanded of him? </p>

                    <p>I therefore, men of the jury, as an avenger of the gods against whom these
                        people have committed sacrilege, and as an avenger of myself, have brought
                        them to trial and submitted them to be judged by you. It is now your duty to
                        render the verdict which justice demands, knowing well that the gods,
                        against whom these people have acted lawlessly, will not be unaware of the
                        vote each one of you shall cast. It is your duty to be avengers in the first
                        place of the gods, but also of your own selves. If you do this, you will be
                        held by all men to have given an honorable and just decision on this
                        indictment which I have preferred against Neaera, charging that she, being
                        an alien, lives as his wife with an Athenian citizen.</p>
