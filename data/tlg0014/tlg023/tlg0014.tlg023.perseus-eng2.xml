                <p>Men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I beg that none of you
                    will imagine that I have come here to arraign the defendant Aristocrates from
                    any motive of private malice, or that I am thrusting myself so eagerly into a
                    quarrel because I have detected some small and trivial blunder, but if my
                    judgement and my views are at all right, the purpose of all my exertions in this
                    case is that you may hold the <placeName key="tgn,7017285"
                        >Chersonese</placeName> securely, and may not for the second time be cheated
                    out of the possession of that country. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
                <p>If, then, it is your desire to learn the truth about this business, and to give a
                    righteous and legitimate verdict on the indictment, you must not confine your
                    attention to the mere phrasing of the decree, but also take into consideration
                    its probable consequences.Had it been possible for you, at a first hearing, to
                    discover the trick that had been played, you would not, perhaps, have been
                    deceived at the outset; </p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
                <p>but, inasmuch as one of our grievances is that certain persons make speeches and
                    move resolutions designed to avert your suspicions and put you off your guard,
                    you must not be greatly astonished if we convince you that this decree also is
                    so worded that, while apparently offering some personal protection to
                    Charidemus, it really robs our city of an honest and effective safeguard for the
                        <placeName key="tgn,7010345">Chersonese</placeName>. </p>
            </div>

                <p>You will be well advised, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, to grant me your attention, and give a favorable
                    hearing to what I have to say. I am not one of the orators who worry you; I am
                    not one of the politicians who enjoy your confidence; yet I undertake to
                    convince you of the importance of this transaction; and therefore, if you will
                    cooperate with me to the best of your power and listen to me with goodwill, you
                    will avert this peril, and at the same time you will overcome the reluctance of
                    any of us plain citizens who may believe himself able to do the State a good
                    turn. And he will so believe, if only he is satisfied that it is not difficult
                    to get a hearing in this court; </p>

                <p>though at present many of us,—inexpert speakers, perhaps, and yet better men than
                    the experts—so dread this ordeal that they never think even of examining any
                    public question. You may be sure that I for one, as Heaven is my witness, would
                    never have dared to lay this indictment, if I had not thought it entirely
                    dishonorable that at this time, when I see people engaged in a project to the
                    disadvantage of our commonwealth, I should hold my peace, and close my lips,—I
                    who, on a former occasion, when I sailed for the <placeName key="tgn,7002638"
                        >Hellespont</placeName> in command of a war-galley, spoke out and denounced
                    certain men who, in my judgement, were doing you wrong. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
                <p>I am not ignorant that Charidemus is regarded by some as a benefactor of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. But if I can find
                    ability to tell you what I mean, and what I know him to have done, I hope to
                    prove that, so far from being our benefactor, he is particularly ill-disposed to
                    us, and that exactly the wrong conception has been formed of his character. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="section">
                <p>If, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the most serious
                    offence committed by Aristocrates had been that in his decree he was so
                    solicitous for the safety of such a man as I undertake to prove Charidemus to be
                    that he provided a special and illegal penalty, in case anything happened to
                    him, I should have tried to deal with that point at once, for the purpose of
                    proving that the man is very far from deserving the favour of this decree. There
                    is, however, a much graver iniquity involved in the decree, of which you must
                    first be informed, and against which you must take precaution. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="section">
                <p>It is essential that at the outset I should explain to you the circumstances to
                    which you owe the secure possession of the <placeName key="tgn,7010345"
                        >Chersonese</placeName>, for in the light of that knowledge you will get a
                    clear perception of the wrong that has been committed. The circumstances, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are these. On the demise
                    of Cotys three persons instead of one became kings of Thrace—Berisades,
                    Amadocus, and Cersobleptes; and the natural result was that they competed with
                    one another and that they all flattered you and courted your favour. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="section">
                <p>Well, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, certain persons
                    who wanted to put a stop to that state of affairs, to get rid of the other
                    kings, and to put Cersobleptes in possession of an undivided monarchy, contrived
                    to equip themselves with this provisional resolution. If one listened only to
                    the wording, they were far from appearing to pursue any such purpose; and yet
                    such was in fact their main object, as I will proceed to explain. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="section">
                <p>On the death of Berisades, one of the three kings, Cersobleptes, in violation of
                    a sworn treaty concluded with you, began to levy war upon the sons of Berisades
                    and upon Amadocus; and it was at once foreseen that Athenodorus would come to
                    the aid of the sons of Berisades, and Simon and Bianor to that of Amadocus, the
                    former being related by marriage to Berisades and the two latter to Amadocus.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="section">
                <p>Accordingly the persons I have mentioned began to consider by what means those
                    commanders might be compelled to remain inactive, so that, the rival princes
                    being friendless, Charidemus, who was striving to win the monarchy for
                    Cersobleptes, might make himself master of the situation. The first plan was to
                    get a decree enacted by you, making any man who should kill Charidemus liable to
                    arrest; and the second was that Charidemus should receive from you a general's
                    commission. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="section">
                <p>For neither Simon nor Bianor, both of whom had been admitted to your citizenship,
                    and who were, apart from that, thoroughly well affected towards you, was likely
                    to take the field against a general of yours while Athenodorus, an Athenian
                    citizen by birthright, would never dream of doing so, nor would he incur the
                    criminal charge set up by the decree, which would certainly be brought against
                    those commanders, if anything happened to Charidemus. By these means, the kings
                    being denuded of allies, and impunity provide for themselves, they hoped easily
                    to drive them out and seize the monarchy. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="section">
                <p>Of such intentions and of such artifices they are accused by the evidence of
                    facts; for, at the moment when they began hostilities, Aristomachus of Alopece
                    visited you as their ambassador, and in his oration before the assembly, not
                    content with commending Cersobleptes and Charidemus and enlarging on their
                    generous sentiments towards you, </p>
            </div>
            <div n="14" type="section">
                <p>he declared that Charidemus was the only man in the world who could recover
                        <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> for <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and advised you to appoint him as
                    general. But this preliminary resolution had already been drafted and
                    preconcerted by them, in order that, if you should be captivated by the promises
                    and expectations which Aristomachus held out to you, it might be ratified there
                    and then by the Assembly, and no impediment might remain. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="15" type="section">
                <p>Yet what more ingenious and cunning device could these men have concocted to
                    obtain the expulsion of the other kings, and the subjection of the whole realm
                    to the monarch whom they preferred, than when they intimidated the commanders
                    who would otherwise have supported the two rivals, and put them on their guard
                    against that spiteful accusation which they might reasonably expect to encounter
                    by the operation of this decree; and when on the other hand they conferred upon
                    the man who was scheming to get the monarchy for one king, and was laying plans
                    entirely opposed to your interests, such ample licence to proceed without fear?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="section">
                <p>Nor is it only these considerations that prove that such was the purpose for
                    which the resolution was moved: the decree itself supplies evidence of great
                    weight. After drafting the words “if any person put Charidemus to death,” and
                    omitting any proviso of what Charidemus might be doing, whether for or against
                    your advantage, the mover forthwith added, “he shall be liable to seizure and
                    removal from the territory of our allies.” </p>
            </div>
            <div n="17" type="section">
                <p>Now no man who is an enemy of ours as well as of Charidemus will ever enter
                    allied territory, whether he has put him to death or not, and therefore it is
                    not against such men that this retribution has been directed. The man who will
                    be alarmed by this decree, and will be on his guard against be coming our
                    certain enemy, is one who is a friend of ours, and also an enemy of his, if he
                    should attempt anything inimical to us. And that man is Athenodorus, or Simon,
                    or Bianor, kings of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, or any
                    other man who may wish to lay you under obligation by restraining Charidemus
                    when he is trying to act in opposition to you. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="18" type="section">
                <p>Such, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are the purposes
                    for which the provisional resolution was moved, in the hope that it would be
                    ratified by a deluded Assembly; and such the reasons why we, desiring to
                    frustrate its ratification, have brought this present indictment. As I have
                    undertaken to prove three propositions,—first that the decree is
                    unconstitutional, secondly that it is injurious to the common weal, and thirdly
                    that the person in whose favour it has been moved is unworthy of such
                    privilege,—it is, perhaps, fair that I should allow you, who are to hear me, to
                    choose what you wish to hear first, and second, and last. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="19" type="section">
                <p>Consider what you prefer, that I may begin with that.—You wish me to deal first
                    with the illegality? Very well; I will do so. There is a favour which I not only
                    ask but claim from you all,—with justice, as I am inclined to think. I beg that
                    none of you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, taking a
                    partisan view, because you have been deceived in Charidemus and look on him as a
                    benefactor, will give an unfriendly hearing to my remarks on the point of law.
                    Do not, for that reason, rob yourselves of the power to cast an honest vote, and
                    me of the right to present my whole case as I think fit. You must listen to me
                    in the manner following,—and observe how fairly I will put it. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="20" type="section">
                <p>When I am discussing the point of law, you must disregard the person, and the
                    character of the person, in whose favour the decree has been proposed, and
                    attend to the question whether it is legal or illegal,—that and that alone. When
                    I am bringing the man's deeds home to him, and relating in what fashion you have
                    been overreached by him, you must look only at the transactions,—do I relate
                    them accurately or untruly? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="21" type="section">
                <p>And when I inquire whether or not the enactment of this decree is conducive to
                    the public good, dismiss everything else and watch my reasoning on that
                    point,—is it sound or unsound? Listen to me in that manner, and you will get a
                    better understanding of what you ought to know, by looking at one question at a
                    time, instead of inquiring into all the issues at once, while I shall have no
                    difficulty in explaining what I mean. On every topic my remarks shall be brief.

                <p>Stop there. You have heard the statute, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, and you have also heard the decree. Let me tell you how
                    you will more readily grasp the arguments on the question of illegality.
                    Consider the status of the person in whose favour the decree has been proposed:
                    is he an alien, a resident alien, or a citizen? If we call him a resident alien,
                    we shall not be telling the truth; and if we call him an alien, we shall be
                    doing him wrong, for it is only fair to him to admit the validity of that grace
                    of the people by which he was made a citizen. It seems, then, that we must treat
                    him as a citizen in our arguments. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="24" type="section">
                <p>Now I beg you to observe how candidly and honestly I am going to treat the
                    question; for I assign him to that class which entitles him to the greatest
                    respect, though I do deny his right to acquire illegally privileges not enjoyed
                    by us who are citizens by birthright,—the privileges, I mean, which the
                    defendant has specified in this decree. In the statute it is provided that the
                    Council shall take cognizance of homicide, intentional wounding, arson, and
                    poisoning, if a man kills another by giving him poison. </p>

                <p>The legislator, while he presumes the killing, has nevertheless directed a
                    judicial inquiry before specifying what is to be done to the culprit, and
                    thereby has shown a just respect, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, for the religious feeling of the whole city. I say of
                    the whole city, because it is impossible that all of you should know who the
                    manslayer is. He thought it scandalous to give credit to such accusations, when
                    made, without a trial; and he conceived that, inasmuch as the avenging of the
                    sufferer is in our hands, we ought to be informed and satisfied by argument that
                    the accused is guilty, for then conscience permits us to inflict punishment
                    according to knowledge, but not before. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="26" type="section">
                <p>Moreover he argued that before the trial is held such expressions as “if a man
                    kill,” “if a man rob a temple,” “if a man commit treason,” and the like, are
                    merely phrases of accusation: they become definitions of crime only after trial
                    and conviction. To a formula of accusation he thought it proper to attach not
                    punishment, but only trial; and therefore, when enacting that, if one man killed
                    another, the Council should take cognizance, he did not lay down what should be
                    done to the culprit if found guilty. </p>

                    man kill,” as the legislator; but the sequel is not the same. He struck out
                    submission to trial, and made the culprit liable to immediate seizure; he passed
                    by the tribunal appointed by law, and handed over to the accusers, to be dealt
                    with as they chose, a man untried, a man whose guilt is not yet proven. </p>

                    most righteously it is framed by the legislator. He uses the term “murderers”;
                    but in the first place you see that by murderer he means a man found guilty by
                    verdict; for no man comes under that designation until he has been convicted and
                    found guilty. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="30" type="section">
                <p>That is made clear both in the earlier statute and in this one; for in the
                    former, after the words “if any man kill,” the legislator directs the Council to
                    take cognizance, and here, after designating the man as “the murderer,” he has
                    directed what is to be done to him. That is to say, when it is a question of
                    accusation, he has ordered a trial, but when the culprit, being found guilty, is
                    liable to this designation, he has specified the penalty. Therefore he should be
                    speaking only of persons found guilty. Well, what does he direct? That it shall
                    be lawful to kill them and to put them under arrest. </p>

            <div n="31" type="section">
                <p>Does he say that they are to be taken to the house of the prosecutor, or as he
                    pleases? No, indeed. How are they to be arrested? “As directed on the first
                    turning-table,” is the phrase; and you all know what that means. The judicial
                    archons are there authorized to punish with death persons who have gone into
                    exile on a charge of murder. Only last year you all saw the culprit who was
                    arrested by them in the Assembly. It is to the archons, then, that the murderer
                    is to be taken on arrest; </p>

            <div n="32" type="section">
                <p>and that differs from being taken to the house of the prosecutor in this respect,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,—that the captor who
                    carries a man to the judges gives control of the malefactor to the laws, while
                    the captor who takes him home gives such control to himself. In the former case
                    punishment is suffered as the law enjoins; in the latter, as the captor pleases;
                    and of course it makes a vast difference whether the retribution is controlled
                    by the law or by a private enemy. </p>

            <div n="33" type="section">
                <p>“Not to maltreat or amerce,” says the statute. What does that mean? Every one, I

                    scourging, no binding nor anything like that, and that not to amerce means not
                    to extort blood-money, for the ancients called fining amercement. </p>

            <div n="34" type="section">
                <p>Note that in this manner the law lays down not only how the murderer or convict
                    is to be punished, but also where, for it specifies the country of the person
                    injured, and it directly prescribes that the penalty is to be inflicted in that
                    way and in no other, in that place and in no other. Yet the author of the decree
                    is far indeed from making this distinction,—his proposals are exactly contrary.
                    After the words, “if anyone shall kill Charidemus,” he adds, “he shall be liable
                    to seizure everywhere.”— </p>

                    be liable to seizure without trial in any allied territory? And when the laws
                    forbid seizure even in our own territory, do you permit seizure? Indeed, in
                    making a man liable to seizure you have permitted everything that the law has
                    forbidden,—extortion of blood-money, maltreatment and misusage of a living man,
                    private custody and private execution. </p>

                    accusation, and “if any man be a murderer, directed against a culprit found
                    guilty; yet in your description you adopted the expression that applies to a man
                    accused, while you propose for untried culprits a penalty which the law does not
                    permit even after conviction. You have eliminated the intermediate process, for
                    between accusation and conviction comes a trial.—There is not a word about trial

                    an Athenian citizen; and the Criminal Court shall adjudicate.” What does this
                    mean? In his opinion it was just that, if a man who had gone into exile, when
                    convicted on a charge of murder, should make good his flight and escape, he
                    should be excluded from the country of the murdered man; but that it was not
                    righteous to put him to death anywhere and everywhere. His view was that, if we
                    put to death people who have gone into exile elsewhere, others will put to death
                    people who have come into exile here; </p>

                <p>and that, in that event, the only chance of salvation left for all those who are
                    unfortunate will be destroyed, that is to say, the power of migrating from the
                    country of those whom they have injured to a country where no one has been
                    wronged by them, and there dwelling in security. To avert that misfortune, and
                    to prevent an endless succession of retributions, he wrote: “if any man kill a
                    murderer, so long as he absents himself from the frontier-market,”—meaning
                    thereby the confines of the man's own country. It was there, I suppose, that in
                    old times borderers of our own and neighboring countries used to forgather; and
                    so he speaks of a “frontier-market.” </p>

            <div n="40" type="section">
                <p>Or take the words, “from Amphictyonic sacrifices.” Why did he also exclude the
                    murderer from them? He debars the offender from everything in which the deceased
                    used to participate in his lifetime; first from his own country and from all
                    things therein, whether permitted or sacred, assigning the frontier-market as
                    the boundary from which he declares him excluded; and secondly from the
                    observances at Amphictyonic assemblies, because the deceased, if a Hellene, also
                    took part therein. “And from the games,”—why from the games? Because the
                    athletic contests of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> are open to
                    all men,—the sufferer was concerned in them because everybody was concerned in
                    them; therefore the murderer must absent himself. </p>

            <div n="41" type="section">
                <p>Accordingly the law excludes the murderer from all these places; but if anyone
                    puts him to death elsewhere, outside the places specified, the same retribution
                    is provided as when an Athenian is slain. He did not describe the fugitive by
                    the name of the city, for in that name he has no part, but by that of the act
                    for which he is chargeable. Accordingly he says: “if any man kill the murderer;”
                    and afterwards, when he prescribed the places from which the man is debarred, he
                    introduces the name of the City for the lawful assignment of punishment: “he
                    shall be liable to the same penalty as if he killed an Athenian.” Gentlemen,
                    that phrase is very different from the wording of the decree before us. </p>

                    mercy which the unfortunate may justly claim from those who are unconcerned in

                    is uncertain for which of us that benefit is in store? In this case, if the man

                    by men who capture him as an outcast, after he has gone into exile, and while he
                    absents himself from the places specified in the law, they will be liable to a

                    have “quitted the country,” not of those who have gone into exile, and because
                    it specifies persons “whose goods are not confiscate,” for the property of

                    country he permits them to be pursued and seized; but outside of it he permits
                    neither seizure nor pursuit. For anyone who contravenes this rule he orders the
                    same punishment as if he had done the man wrong at home, in the words, “shall
                    incur the same penalty as if he had so acted at home.” </p>
            </div>
            <div n="47" type="section">
                <p>Now suppose the defendant Aristocrates were asked,—you must not think it a silly
                    question—first if he knows whether Charidemus will be killed by someone, or will
                    die in some other way. He would reply, I take it, that he does not know.
                    However, we will presume that somebody will kill him. Next question: will the
                    man who is to do it be a voluntary or an involuntary agent, an alien or a
                    citizen,—do you know, Aristocrates? You cannot say that you do know. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="48" type="section">
                <p>Then of course you ought to have supplied these particulars, and written, “if any
                    man, whether alien or citizen, shall kill, with or without intention, rightfully
                    or wrongfully,” in order that any man soever, by whom the deed should have been
                    done, might have received his deserts according to law; but assuredly, after
                    merely naming an accusation, you ought not to have added, “he shall be liable to
                    seizure.” What boundary have you left in this clause? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="49" type="section">
                <p>Yet the law distinctly provides that beyond the frontier a man shall not be
                    pursued, whereas you permit him to be seized anywhere. Beyond the frontier the
                    law forbids not only pursuit but also seizure; and yet according to your decree
                    anyone who chooses will take as an outcast and forcibly seize a man who has
                    slain without intention, and carry him by violence into the country of the slain
                    man. Are you not treating human conduct indiscriminately, and ignoring the
                    motives according to which a given act is either virtuous or immoral?— </p>

                <p>Observe, gentlemen, that this is a universal distinction: it does not apply only
                    to questions of homicide. “If a man strike another, giving the first blow,” says
                    the law. The implication is that he is not guilty, if the blow was defensive.
                    “If a man revile another,”—“with false hoods,” the law adds, implying that, if
                    he speaks the truth, he is justified. “If a man slay another with malice
                    aforethought,”—indicating that it is not the same thing if he does it
                    unintentionally. “If a man injures another with intention, wrongfully.”
                    Everywhere we shall find that it is the motive that fixes the character of the
                    act. But not with you: you say, without qualification, “if any man slay
                    Charidemus, he shall be seized,” though he do it unwittingly, or righteously, or
                    in self-defence, or for a purpose permitted by law, or in any way whatsoever.

                    the other excerpts from the law of homicide which I have cited for comparison,
                    is a statute of Draco; and you must pay attention to his meaning. “No man is to
                    be liable to prosecution for murder for laying information against manslayers
                    who return from exile illegally.” Herein he exhibits two principles of justice,
                    both of which have been transgressed by the defendant in his decree. In the
                    first place, though he allows information to be laid against the homicide, he
                    does not allow him to be seized and carried off; and secondly, he allows it only
                    if an exile returns, not to any place, but to a prohibited place. </p>

            <div n="52" type="section">
                <p>Now the prohibited place is the city from which he has gone into exile. That the

                    cannot be used in relation to any other city except that from which he has fled;
                    for of course a man cannot return from exile to a place from which he was never
                    expelled. What is allowed by the statute is an information, and that only in
                    case of return to a prohibited place; whereas Aristocrates has proposed that a

                    none more gravely than that which has just been read. Though the law so clearly
                    gives permission to slay, and states under what conditions, the defendant
                    ignores all those conditions, and has drawn his penal clause without any

                <p>Yet mark how righteously and admirably these distinctions are severally defined
                    by the lawgiver who defined them originally. “If a man kill another in an
                    athletic contest,” he declared him to be not guilty, for this reason, that he
                    had regard not to the event but to the intention of the agent. That intention
                    is, not to kill his man, but to vanquish him unslain. If the other combatant was
                    too weak to support the struggle for victory, he considered him responsible for
                    his own fate, and therefore provided no retribution on his account. </p>

            <div n="55" type="section">
                <p>Again, “if in battle unwittingly”—the man who so slays is free of
                    bloodguiltiness. Good: If I have destroyed a man supposing him to be one of the
                    enemy, I deserve, not to stand trial, but to be forgiven. “Or in intercourse
                    with his wife, or mother, or sister, or daughter, or concubine kept for the
                    procreation of legitimate children.” He lets the man who slays one so treating
                    any of these women go scot-free; and that acquittal, men of <placeName

                    friends, if they insult them and defile them in defiance of law. Men are not our
                    friends and our foes by natural generation: they are made such by their own
                    actions; and the law gives us freedom to chastise as enemies those whose acts
                    are hostile. When there are so many conditions that justify the slaying of
                    anyone else, it is monstrous that that man should be the only man in the world
                    whom, even under those conditions, it is to be unlawful to slay. </p>

                <p>If anyone interrupts me with a question, “And where, pray, are such things likely

                    kill Charidemus?” Well, we need not go into those questions; only, inasmuch as
                    the decree now on trial refers, not to any past transaction, but to something of
                    which nobody knows whether it will happen or not, let the uncertainty of the
                    future be common ground to both sides; let us, as mankind are wont, adjust our

                    has been defrauded of his legal remedy. Therefore on every ground the decree is
                    contrary to law, and ought to be annulled. </p>

                <p>Here are other conditions of lawful homicide. If any man, while violently and
                    illegally seizing another, shall be straightway slain in self-defence, the
                    legislator ordains that there shall be no penalty for his death. I beg you to
                    observe the wisdom of this law. By adding the word “straightway” after
                    indicating the conditions of lawful homicide, the legislator has excluded any
                    long premeditation of injury and by the expression, “in self-defence,” he makes
                    it clear that he is giving indulgence to the actual sufferer, and to no other
                    man. Thus the law permits homicide in immediate self-defence; but Aristocrates
                    has made no such exception. He says, without qualification, “if anyone ever
                    kills,”—that is, even if he kill righteously, or as the laws permit. </p>

                <p>I shall be told that this is a quibble of ours; who will ever be “violently and

                    who has troops at command lays hands on whomsoever he thinks he can overpower,
                    demanding ransom. Heaven and Earth! Is it not monstrous, is it not manifestly

                    law of our common humanity,—that I should not be permitted to defend myself
                    against one who violently seizes my goods as though I were an enemy? And that
                    will be so, if the slaying of Charidemus is forbidden even on those terms,—if
                    even though he be iniquitously plundering another man's property, his slayer is
                    to be liable to seizure, though the statute ordains that he who takes life under

                    Aristocrates, with very little regard for the lawgiver, is trying both to alter
                    it and to frustrate it. For surely, to permit punishment outside the established

                    draft a series of clauses, all of them exactly contradicting the provisions of

                    of the fact, no oath-taking,—when the penalty follows on the heels of the
                    accusation, and that a penalty forbidden by the laws? Yet all the proceedings I

                    truths, the relation of which reflects credit and honor upon the city, and which
                    you will be gratified to hear. I will begin with a statement which you will find
                    especially instructive, first referring to the free gift which has already been
                    conferred upon Charidemus. </p>

                <p>It was we, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, who made

                    and religious observances, in our legal rights, and in everything in which we
                    ourselves participate. There are many institutions of ours the like of which are
                    not to be found elsewhere, but among them one especially peculiar to ourselves
                    and venerable,—I mean the Court of Areopagus. Concerning that Court I could
                    relate a greater number of noble stories, in part traditional and legendary, in
                    part certified by our own personal testimony, than could be told of any other

                    the gods condescended both to render and to demand satisfaction for homicide,
                    and to sit in judgement upon contending litigants,—Poseidon, according to the
                    legend, deigning to demand justice from Ares on behalf of his son Halirrothius,
                    and the twelve gods to adjudicate between the Eumenides and Orestes. These are
                    ancient stories; let us pass to a later date. This is the only tribunal which no
                    despot, no oligarchy, no democracy, has ever dared to deprive of its
                    jurisdiction in cases of murder, all men agreeing that in such cases no
                    jurisprudence of their own devising could be more effective than that which has
                    been devised in this court. In addition to these great merits, here, and here
                    alone, no convicted defendant and no defeated prosecutor has ever made good any
                    complaint against the justice of the verdict given. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="67" type="section">
                <p>And so, in defiance of this safeguard of justice, and of the lawful penalties
                    that it awards, the author of this decree has offered to Charidemus a free
                    licence to do what he likes as long as he lives, and to his friends the right of
                    vindictive prosecution when he is dead. For look at it in this light. You are
                    all of course aware that in the Areopagus, where the law both permits and
                    enjoins the trial of homicide, first, every man who brings accusation of such a
                    crime must make oath by invoking destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his
                    household; </p>
            </div>
            <div n="68" type="section">
                <p>secondly, that he must not treat this oath as an ordinary oath, but as one which
                    no man swears for any other purpose; for he stands over the entrails of a boar,
                    a ram, and a bull, and they must have been slaughtered by the necessary officers
                    and on the days appointed, so that in respect both of the time and of the
                    functionaries every requirement of solemnity has been satisfied. Even then the
                    person who has sworn this tremendous oath does not gain immediate credence; and
                    if any falsehood is brought home to him, he will carry away with him to his
                    children and his kindred the stain of perjury,—but gain nothing. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="69" type="section">
                <p>If, on the other hand, he is believed to be laying a just charge, and if he
                    proves the accused guilty of murder, even then he has no power over the
                    convicted criminal; only the laws and the appointed officers have power over the
                    man for punishment. The prosecutor is permitted to see him suffering the penalty
                    awarded by law, and that is all. Such are the prosecutor's rights. As for the
                    defendant, the rules for his oath are the same, but he is free to withdraw after
                    making his first speech, and neither the prosecutor, nor the judges, nor any
                    other man, has authority to stop him. </p>

            <div n="70" type="section">
                <p>Now why is that so, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>?
                    Because they who originally ordained these customs, whoever they were, heroes or
                    gods, did not treat evil fortune with severity, but humanely alleviated its
                    calamities, so far as they honestly could. All those regulations, so nobly and
                    equitably conceived, the author of the decree now in question has manifestly
                    infringed, for not a single shred of them is to be found in his decree.—That is
                    my first point: here is one tribunal whose written laws and unwritten usages he
                    has contravened in drafting his decree. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="71" type="section">
                <p>Secondly, there is another tribunal, the court by the Palladium, for the trial of
                    involuntary homicide; and it shall be shown that he nullifies that tribunal
                    also, and transgresses the laws there observed. Here also the order is first the
                    oath-taking, secondly the pleadings, and thirdly the decision of the court; and
                    not one of these processes is found in the defendant's decree. If the culprit be
                    convicted, and found to have committed the act, neither the prosecutor nor any
                    other person has any authority over him, but only the law. And what does the law
                    enjoin? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="72" type="section">
                <p>That the man who is convicted of involuntary homicide shall, on certain appointed
                    days, leave the country by a prescribed route, and remain in exile until he is
                    reconciled to one of the relatives of the deceased. Then the law permits him to
                    return, not casually, but in a certain manner; it instructs him to make
                    sacrifice and to purify himself, and gives other directions for his conduct. In
                    all these provisions, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    the law is right. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="73" type="section">
                <p>It is just to allot a lesser penalty for involuntary than for willful homicide;
                    it is quite right, before ordering a man to go into exile, to provide for his
                    safe departure; and the provisions for the reinstatement of the returning exile,
                    for his purification by customary rites, and so forth, are excellent. Well,
                    everyone of these ordinances, so righteously enacted by the original
                    legislators, has been transgressed by the defendant in drafting his decree. So
                    we have now two tribunals, of great antiquity and high character, and usages
                    handed down from time immemorial, which he has insolently overridden. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="74" type="section">
                <p>Besides these two tribunals there is also a third, whose usages are still more
                    sacred and awe-inspiring, for cases in which a man admits the act of slaying,
                    but pleads that he slew lawfully. That is the court held at the Delphinium. It
                    appears to me, gentlemen of the jury, that the first inquiry made by those who
                    originally defined the rules of jurisprudence in these matters was, whether we
                    are to regard no act of homicide as righteous, or whether any kind of homicide
                    is to be accounted righteous; and that, arguing that Orestes, having slain his
                    own mother, confessing the fact, and finding gods to adjudge his case, was
                    acquitted, they formed the opinion that there is such thing as justifiable
                    homicide,—for gods could not have given an unjust verdict. Having formed this
                    opinion, they immediately set down in writing an exact definition of the
                    conditions under which homicide is lawful. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="75" type="section">
                <p>The defendant, however, admitted no exception; he simply makes an outcast of any
                    man who kills Charidemus, even though he kill him justly or as the laws permit.
                    And yet to every act and to every word one of two epithets is applicable: it is
                    either just or unjust. To no act and to no word can both these epithets be
                    applied at the same time, for how can the same act at the same time be both just
                    and not just? Every act is brought to the test as having the one or the other of
                    these qualities; if it be found to have the quality of injustice, it is adjudged
                    to be wicked, if of justice, to be good and honest.—But you, sir, used neither
                    qualification when you wrote the words, “if any man kill.” You named the mere
                    accusation, without any definition, and then immediately added, “let him be
                    liable to seizure.” Thereby you have evidently ignored this tribunal and its
                    usages as well as the other two. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="76" type="section">
                <p>There is also a fourth tribunal, that at the Prytaneum. Its function is that, if
                    a man is struck by a stone, or a piece of wood or iron, or anything of that
                    sort, falling upon him, and if someone, without knowing who threw it, knows and
                    possesses the implement of homicide, he takes proceedings against these
                    implements in that court. Well, if it is not righteous to deny a trial even to a
                    lifeless and senseless thing, the object of so grave an accusation, assuredly it
                    is impious and outrageous that a man who may possibly be not guilty, and who in
                    any case,—and I will assume him to be guilty,—is a human being endowed by
                    fortune with the same nature as ourselves, should be made an outcast on such a
                    charge without a hearing and without a verdict. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="77" type="section">
                <p>Then there is a fifth tribunal which he has overruled,—and I beg you to take note
                    of its character; I mean the court held in the precinct of Phreatto. In that
                    court, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the law orders
                    every man stand his trial who, having gone into exile on a charge of
                    unintentional homicide, and being still unreconciled to the persons who procured
                    his banishment, incurs a further charge of willful murder. The author of the
                    several rules of court did not let such a man alone, on the ground that he was
                    unable to return to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, nor did
                    he, because the man had already committed a like offence, treat the similarity
                    of the accusation as proof positive against him; </p>
            </div>
            <div n="78" type="section">
                <p>he found a way of satisfying the requirements of religion without depriving the
                    culprit of a fair hearing and a trial. How did he manage it? He conveyed the
                    judges who were to sit to a place to which the accused was able to repair,
                    appointing a place within the country but on the sea-coast, known as the
                    precinct of Phreatto. The culprit approaches the shore in a vessel, and makes
                    his speech without landing, while the judges listen to him and give judgement on
                    shore. If found guilty, the man suffers the penalty of willful murder as he
                    deserves; if acquitted, he goes his way scot-free in respect of that charge, but
                    still subject to punishment for the earlier homicide. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="79" type="section">
                <p>Now with what object have these regulations been made so carefully? The man who
                    drew them up accounted it equally irreligious to let slip the guilty, and to
                    cast out the innocent before trial. But if such great pains are taken in the
                    case of persons already adjudged to be homicides, to ensure for them a hearing,
                    a trial, and fair treatment in every respect upon any subsequent accusation,
                    surely it is most outrageous to provide that a man who has not yet been found
                    guilty, and of whom it is still undecided whether he committed the act or not,
                    and whether the act was involuntary or willful, should be handed over to the
                    mercy of his accusers. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="80" type="section">
                <p>In addition to all these provisions for legal redress there is a sixth, which the
                    defendant has equally defied in his decree. Suppose that a man is ignorant of
                    all the processes I have mentioned, or that the proper time for taking such
                    proceedings has elapsed, that for any other reasons he does not choose to
                    prosecute by those methods; if he sees the homicide frequenting places of
                    worship or the market, he may arrest him and take him to jail; but not, as you
                    have permitted, to his own house or wherever he chooses. When under arrest he
                    will suffer no injury in jail until after his trial; but, if he is found guilty,
                    he will be punished with death. On the other hand, if the person who arrested
                    him does not get a fifth part of the votes, he will be fined a thousand
                    drachmas. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="81" type="section">
                <p>The proposals of the defendant are quite different: the accuser is to prosecute
                    without risk, the culprit to be given up incontinently and without trial; and if
                    any person, or indeed any entire city, shall intervene to prevent the
                    destruction of all those usages which I have described and the overthrow of all
                    the tribunals I have mentioned; tribunals introduced by the gods and frequented
                    by mankind from that day to this,—and to rescue the victims of outrage and
                    lawless violence, he proposes that any such person shall be banned; for him also
                    he allows no hearing and no trial, but punishes him instantly and without trial.

                    and the remarkable humanity with which it is drawn up. </p>

            <div n="83" type="section">
                <p>“If any man die a violent death,” says the legislator. First, by adding the
                    epithet “violent,” he has given an indication by which we understand his meaning
                    to be, “if a man die wrongfully.” “His kinsmen may take and hold hostages in
                    respect of such death, until they either submit to trial for bloodguiltiness, or
                    surrender the actual manslayers.” You will note what an admirable provision this
                    is. He requires the hostages, in the first instance, to stand trial; and then if
                    they refuse, he enjoins them to give up the murderers; but, if they decline both
                    these duties, he adds that the right to hold hostages is limited to three and no
                    more. The whole of this statute is defied in the wording of the decree. </p>

                    proposes that the culprit shall be liable to seizure instantly and before any
                    claim of redress has been made. Furthermore, while the statute ordains that, if
                    the persons in whose house the death took place will neither submit to trial nor
                    give up the perpetrators, as many as three may be detained as hostages, </p>

                    culprit, who, as I will assume, has already gone into exile, if they refuse to
                    surrender their suppliant. Thus, by omitting to specify the mode of the
                    homicide, by not providing for a trial, by omitting the claim of redress, by
                    permitting arrest in any place whatsoever, by punishing those who harbor the
                    fugitive, and by not punishing those in whose house the death took place,—in

                    claiming for his decree authority superior to that of a statute? </p>

                <p>Now I wish to cite for your information one or two decrees drawn in favour of
                    genuine benefactors of the commonwealth, to satisfy you that it is easy to frame
                    such things without injustice, when they are drawn for the express purpose of
                    doing honor to a man, and of admitting him to a share of our own privileges, and
                    when, under the pretence of doing so, there is no malicious and fraudulent
                    intention.—Read these decrees.—To save you a long hearing, the clauses
                    corresponding to that for which I am prosecuting the defendant have been
                    extracted from the several decrees.<quote type="Decrees">

                <p>You see, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that they
                    have all drawn them in the same fashion. For instance: “There shall be the same
                    redress for him as if the person slain were an Athenian.” Here, without
                    tampering with your existing laws respecting such offences, they enhance the
                    dignity of those laws by making it an act of grace to allow a share in them to
                    others. Not so Aristocrates: he does his very best to drag the laws through the
                    mire; anyhow, he tried to compose something of his own, as though they were
                    worth nothing; and he makes light even of that act of grace which you bestowed
                    your citizenship upon Charidemus. For when he assumes that you still owe the man
                    a debt of gratitude, and has proposed that you should protect him into the
                    bargain, so that he may do just what he likes with impunity, does not such
                    conduct merit my description? </p>

            <div n="90" type="section">
                <p>I am well aware, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that,
                    although Aristocrates will be quite unable to disprove the charge of framing his
                    decree in open defiance of the laws, he will make an attempt to shuffle away the
                    most serious part of the accusation,—namely, that from beginning to end of his
                    decree he does not order any trial of a very grave indictment. On that point I
                    do not think I need say much; but I will prove clearly from the actual phrasing
                    of the decree that he himself does not suppose that the man accused will get any
                    trial at all. </p>

            <div n="91" type="section">
                <p>The words are: “If any man kill Charidemus, he shall be liable to seizure; and if
                    any person or any city rescue him, they shall be put under ban,”—not merely in
                    case they refuse to give up for trial the man they have rescued, but absolutely
                    and without more ado. And yet if he were permitting instead of disallowing a
                    trial, he would have made the penal clause against the rescuers conditional upon
                    their not giving up for trial the person rescued. </p>

            <div n="92" type="section">
                <p>I dare say that he will use the following argument, and that he will try very
                    hard to mislead you on this point. The decree, he will urge, is invalid because
                    it is merely a provisional resolution,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An order
                        of Council not valid until confirmed by the vote of the Assembly.</note> and
                    the law provides that resolutions of the Council shall be in force for one year
                    only; therefore, if you acquit him today, the commonwealth can take no harm in
                    respect of his decree. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="93" type="section">
                <p>I think your rejoinder to that argument should be that the defendant's purpose in
                    drafting the decree was, not that it should be inoperative and have no
                    disagreeable results,—for it was open to him not to draft it at all, if he had
                    wished to consult the best advantage of the commonwealth;—but that you might be
                    misled and certain people might be enabled to carry through projects opposed to
                    your interests. That the decree has been challenged, that its operation has been
                    delayed, and that it has now become invalid, you owe to us; and it is
                    preposterous that the very reasons that ought to make you grateful to us should
                    be available as reasons for acquitting our opponents. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="94" type="section">
                <p>Moreover the question is not so simple as some suppose. If there were no other
                    man likely to propose decrees like his without regard to your interests, the
                    matter might, perhaps, be a simple one. But in fact there are many such; and
                    that is why it is not right that you should refuse to annul this decree. If it
                    is pronounced flawless, who will not move decrees in future without misgiving?
                    Who will refuse to put them to the vote? Who will impeach them? What you have to
                    take into account is, not that this decree has become invalid by lapse of time,
                    but that, if you now give judgement for the defendant, by that verdict you will
                    be offering impunity to every man who may hereafter wish to do you a mischief.

            <div n="95" type="section">
                <p>It also occurs to my mind, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, that Aristocrates, having no straightforward or honest
                    defence, nor indeed any defence at all, to offer, will resort to such fallacious
                    arguments as this,—that many similar decrees have been made before now in favour
                    of many persons. That is no proof, gentlemen, of the legality of his own
                    proposal. There are many pretences by which you have often been misled. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="96" type="section">
                <p>For instance, suppose that one of those decrees which have in fact been
                    disallowed had never been impeached in this Court. It would certainly have been
                    operative; nevertheless it would have been moved contrary to law. Or suppose
                    that a decree, being impeached, was pronounced flawless, because the
                    prosecutors, either collusively or through incompetence, had failed to make good
                    their case: that failure does not make it legal. Then the jurors do not give
                    conscientious verdicts? Yes, they do; I will explain how. They are sworn to
                    decide to the best of an honest judgement; but the view that commends itself to
                    their judgement is guided by the speeches to which they listen, and, inasmuch as
                    they cast their votes in accordance with that view, they are true to their oath.

            <div n="97" type="section">
                <p>Every man keeps his oath who does not, through spite or favour or other dishonest
                    motive, vote against his better judgement. Suppose that he does not apprehend
                    some point that is explained to him, he does not deserve to be punished for his
                    lack of intelligence. The man who is amenable to the curse is the advocate who
                    deceives and misleads the jury. That is why, at every meeting, the crier
                    pronounces a commination, not upon those who have been misled, but upon
                    whosoever makes a misleading speech to the Council, or to the Assembly, or to
                    the Court. </p>

            <div n="98" type="section">
                <p>Do not listen to proof that the thing has happened, but only to proof that it
                    ought to have happened. Do not let them tell you that those old decrees were
                    upheld by other juries; ask them to satisfy you that their plea for this decree
                    is fairer than ours. Failing that, I do not think that you ought to give greater
                    weight to the delusions of others than to your own judgement. </p>

            <div n="99" type="section">
                <p>Moreover, I cannot but think that there is something uncommonly impudent in such
                    a plea as that other people have before now got decrees of this sort.—If, sir,
                    an illegal act has already been done, and you have imitated that act, that is no
                    reason why you should be acquitted. On the contrary, it is an additional reason
                    why you should be convicted. If one of them had been found guilty, you would
                    never have moved our decree and similarly another will be deterred, if you are
                    found guilty today. </p>

            <div n="100" type="section">
                <p>I say that I do not expect that Aristocrates will be able to deny that he has
                    moved a decree in open violation of all the laws; but before now, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I have seen a man
                    contesting an indictment for illegal measures, who, though convicted by law,
                    made an attempt to argue that his proposal had been to the public advantage, and
                    insisted strongly on that point,—a simple-minded argument, surely, if it was not
                    an impudent one. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="101" type="section">
                <p>Admit a man's proposition to be in every other respect advantageous; it is still
                    disadvantageous in so far as he begs you, who are sworn to give judgement
                    according to law, to ratify a decree which he himself cannot prove to have been
                    honestly drawn, seeing that every man is bound to set the highest value upon
                    fidelity to his oath. At the same time the plea, though impertinent, has reason
                    in it; but not a reason which Aristocrates will be able to submit to you.
                    Entirely opposed as his decree is to the laws, it is not less pernicious than
                    illegal. </p>

            <div n="102" type="section">
                <p>That is the point which I wish now to make good to you; and, in order to do what
                    I wish in as few words as possible, will cite an illustration that is well known
                    to you all. You are aware that it is for the advantage of Athens that neither
                    the Thebans nor the Lacedaemonians should be powerful; that the Thebans should
                    be counterbalanced by the Phocians, and the Lacedaemonians by other communities;
                    because, when that is the position of affairs, you are the strongest nation, and
                    can dwell in security. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="103" type="section">
                <p>You must, then, take the view that for those of our fellow-citizens who live in
                    the <placeName key="tgn,7017285">Chersonese</placeName> the same condition is
                    advantageous, that is, that no one man shall be all-powerful among the
                    Thracians. In fact the quarrels of the Thracians, and their jealousy of one
                    another, afford the best and most trustworthy guarantee of the safety of the
                        <placeName key="tgn,7017285">Chersonese</placeName>. Now the decree before
                    us, by offering security to the minister who controls the affairs of
                    Cersobleptes, and by putting the commanders of the other kings in imminent fear
                    of being accused of crime, makes those kings weak, and the king who stands by
                    himself strong. </p>

                    remind you of a piece of history within the knowledge of all of you. After the
                        revolt<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In 361; See Grote, chap. 80.</note>
                    of Miltocythes against Cotys, when the war had already lasted a considerable
                    time, when Ergophilus had been superseded, and Autocles was on the point of
                    sailing to take command, a decree was proposed here in such terms that
                    Miltocythes withdrew in alarm, supposing that you were not well disposed towards
                    him, and Cotys gained possession of the Sacred Mountain and its treasures. Now
                    observe that later, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    although Autocles was put on his trial for having brought Miltocythes to ruin,
                    the time for indicting the author of the decree was past; and, so far as
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was concerned, the whole
                    business had come to grief. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="105" type="section">
                <p>Even so today, if you do not annul this decree, the kings and their commanders
                    will be immensely discouraged. They will regard themselves as altogether
                    slighted, and will imagine that your favour is inclining towards Cersobleptes.
                    Now suppose that on this assumption they surrender their royalty, whenever
                    Cersobleptes seizes opportunity and attacks them; and again observe what will
                    happen.— </p>

            <div n="106" type="section">
                <p>In heaven's name, tell me this. If Cersobleptes attacks us,—and he is more likely
                    than not to do so, when he has the power,—shall we not have recourse to those
                    kings? Shall we not try to reduce him through them? Very well; then suppose they
                    reply: “Athenians, so far from helping us when we were ill-treated, you made us
                    grievously afraid of defending ourselves, for you issued a decree that anyone
                    who should kill the man who was working against your interests and ours alike,
                    should be liable to seizure. Therefore you have no right to call upon us to help
                    you in a matter which you mismanaged for us as well as for yourselves.” Tell me
                    this, I say: will not they have the best of the argument? I think so. </p>

                <p>Again, it cannot possibly be alleged that it was natural that you should be
                    hoodwinked and misled. For even though you had no other basis of calculation,
                    even though you were unable of yourselves to grasp the state of affairs, you had
                    before your eyes the example of those people at <placeName

                    And how are they treating him? He restored <placeName key="tgn,6004814"
                        >Potidaea</placeName> to them, not at a time when he was no longer able to
                    keep them out, as Cersobleptes restored the <placeName key="tgn,7012057"
                        >Chersonesus</placeName> to you; no,—after spending a great deal of money on
                    his war with you, when he had taken <placeName key="tgn,6004814"
                        >Potidaea</placeName>, and could have kept it if he chose, he made them a

            <div n="108" type="section">
                <p>Nevertheless, although so long as they saw that he was not too powerful to be
                    trusted, they were his allies and fought us on his account, when they found that
                    his strength had grown too great for their confidence, they did not make a
                    decree that whosoever should kill any man who had helped to consolidate Philip's
                    power should be liable to seizure in the country of their allies. </p>

            <div n="109" type="section">
                <p>No, indeed; they have made friendship, and promise to make alliance, with
                    you,—you who of all men in the world would be most delighted to kill Philip's
                    friends or even Philip himself. When mere Olynthians know how to provide for the
                    morrow, will not you, who are Athenians, do likewise? It is discreditable that
                    you, who have a reputation for superior ability in political deliberation,
                    should be convicted of a duller perception of your own advantage than

                <p>I am informed that Aristocrates will also say something to the same effect as a
                    speech once made in the Assembly by Aristomachus,—that it is inconceivable that
                    Cersobleptes would ever deliberately provoke your enmity by trying to rob you of
                    the <placeName key="tgn,7012057">Chersonesus</placeName>, because, even if he
                    should take it and hold it, it will be of no use to him. Indeed when that

                    is at war, not a single talent. On the other hand the revenue of his ports,
                    which, in the event supposed, would be blockaded, is more than two hundred
                    talents. They wonder,—as they will put it,—what he could possibly mean by
                    preferring small returns and a war with you, when he might get larger returns
                    and be your friend. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="111" type="section">
                <p>But I am at no loss for plenty of instances in the light of which a man might
                    reasonably be skeptical, instead of putting his trust in those orators, and
                    allowing Cersobleptes to become a potentate. However, I will be content with the
                    instance that lies nearest to hand. Of course, gentlemen, you all know that
                    Macedonian, Philip. It was certainly more profitable for him to draw the
                    revenues of all <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> in safety,
                    than the revenue of <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>
                    with risks attached; and more agreeable to have you, his hereditary friends, on
                    his side, than the Thessalians who once ejected his own father. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="112" type="section">
                <p>Apart from that, it may be observed that you, Athenians, never yet betrayed any
                    of your friends, while the Thessalians have betrayed every one of theirs.
                    Nevertheless, in spite of all that, you see that he has deliberately chosen
                    small gains, faithless friends, and big risks, in preference to a life of
                    security. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="113" type="section">
                <p>Now what can be the reason? For the logic of the thing is certainly not so very
                    obvious. The truth is, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                    >Athens</placeName>, that there are two things that are excellent for everybody:
                    good luck, the chiefest and greatest of goods, and good counsel, inferior to
                    good luck, but greater than any other; but men do not get both these good things
                    at once, and no successful man sets any limit or end to his desire to get more.
                    And that is why men, in the desire for more, so often throw away what they
                    already have. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="114" type="section">
                <p>But what need to name Philip, or any other man? Why, Cersobleptes' own father,
                    Cotys, whenever he had a quarrel on hand, used to send his ambassadors, and was
                    ready to do anything, and then he could see that being at war with <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was quite unprofitable. But, as soon
                    as he had all <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> at his command, he
                    would occupy cities, do mischief, discharge his drunken fury, first on himself,
                    and then on us; he must needs subjugate the whole country; there was no dealing
                    with the fellow. For everybody who attempts improper enterprises for the sake of
                    aggrandizement is apt to look, not to the difficulties of his task, but to what
                    he will achieve if successful. </p>

                <p>My own opinion, then, is that your policy should be fashioned in such a way that,
                    if Cersobleptes' views in regard to you are what they should be, he shall not be
                    unjustly treated by you, but that, if he is so unreasonable as to treat you
                    unjustly, he may not be too strong to be punished. I will read to you the letter
                    which Cersobleptes sent at the time of the revolt of Miltocythes, and also that
                    which, when the whole kingdom was his, he sent to Timomachus before seizing your

                    which, if you will be guided by me, you will bear in mind; and, remembering also
                    that, when Philip was besieging <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
                        >Amphipolis</placeName>, he pretended to be doing so in order to hand the
                    place over to you, but that, when he had got it, he annexed <placeName

                    the same sort of assurance that, according to the story, Philocrates, son of
                    Ephialtes, once opposed to the Lacedaemonians. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="117" type="section">
                <p>It is said that, when the Lacedaemonians were trying to overreach him, and
                    offered any assurance he was willing to accept, Philocrates replied that the
                    only possible assurance would be that they should satisfy him that, if they had
                    a mind to injure him, they would not have the power; “for,” he added, “I am
                    quite certain that you will always have the mind, and there can be no assurance
                    so long as you have the power.” That,—if you will let me advise you,—is the sort
                    of assurance that you will hold against this Thracian. If he ever became master
                    of all <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, you need not inquire

                <p>That it is entirely the act of insane men to compose such decrees, or to bestow
                    such favours as this, may easily be learned from many examples. I am sure, men
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that you all know as well
                    as I do that you once admitted Cotys over yonder to your citizenship, evidently
                    because you regarded him at the time as a sincere well-wisher. Indeed, you
                    decorated him with golden crowns; and you would never have done that, if you had
                    thought him your enemy. </p>

            <div n="119" type="section">
                <p>Nevertheless, when he was a wicked, unprincipled man, and was doing you serious
                    injury, you treated the men who put him to death,
                            <persName><surname>Pytho</surname></persName> and Heracleides of

                    citizens, and decorated them with crowns of gold. Now suppose that, at the time
                    when the disposition of Cotys was thought to be friendly, it had been proposed
                    that any one who killed Cotys should be given up for punishment, would you have
                    given up <persName><surname>Pytho</surname></persName> and his brother? Or would
                    you, in defiance of the decree, have given them your citizenship, and honored

                    time when he had imprisoned Pelopidas, and was holding him captive, when he was
                    the most bitter enemy of the Thebans, when his feelings towards you were so
                    fraternal that he applied to you for a commander, when you gave aid to his arms,
                    when it was Alexander here and Alexander there,—why, gracious heavens! if
                    anybody had moved that whoever killed Alexander should be liable to seizure,
                    would it have been safe for any man to try to give him due punishment for his

                    citizens in the act of trying to restore Argaeus, he released them and made good
                    all their losses, when he professed in a written message that he was ready to
                    form an alliance with us, and to renew his ancestral amity, if at that time he
                    had asked us for this favour, and if one of the men he had released had proposed
                    that “whoever shall kill Philip” should be liable to seizure, a fine insult we

                    by vote any such resolution as this? I say it is not the part of sane men either
                    to put such confidence in a man, whenever they imagine him to be friendly, as to
                    deprive themselves of all defence against possible aggression, or, on the other
                    hand, when they regard anyone as an enemy, to hate him so fiercely that, if he
                    ever wants to reform and be their friend, they have taken it out of his power to
                    do so. But we should, I think, carry both our friendship and our hatred only so
                    far as not to exceed the due measure in either case. </p>

                    Charidemus,—Simon, for example, if you want a name, or Bianor, or Athenodorus,
                    or thousands more. No; if we make the same decree in favour of the whole
                    company, we shall unconsciously make ourselves a bodyguard for every one of

                    everyone who desires to become an Athenian citizen, because he has fallen in
                    love with our customs and laws, will make his home in our midst, as soon as he
                    receives our franchise, and will enjoy his share in the advantages he coveted.
                    But as for those who are not moved by any desire or emulation of those
                    institutions, but value only the advantage they derive from the credit of being
                    distinguished by you, I fancy, indeed I am quite certain, that as soon as they
                    discern a prospect of larger advantage elsewhere, they will devote their
                    attention to that prospect, without the least concern for you. </p>

            <div n="127" type="section">

                    did not think it safe to take his chance of a place of refuge, he came to you,
                    applied for your citizenship, and thought you the finest people in the world.
                    But now that he thinks relations with Philip more advantageous to him, he takes
                    Philip's side, without the slightest regard for you. No, men of <placeName

                    pursuit of their own ambitions, I say that there is no stability and no honesty
                    to be found in them. Every sensible man must get the better of such people by
                    wary conduct: he should not begin by trusting and end by denouncing them. </p>

                <p>Athenians, if we should assume,—though it is the reverse of the truth,—that

                    he will never entertain any other sentiment, it is not a whit the more wise to
                    pass such decrees for him. If he had accepted the security offered by the decree
                    for any other purpose than the interests of Cersobleptes, the danger would have
                    been less; but, in fact, I find on a calculation of probabilities that the man
                    for whose benefit he will turn to account the advantage given by the decree is
                    himself equally unworthy of his confidence and of ours. </p>

                <p>Observe how honestly I examine the several points, and how entirely reasonable

                    marriage to Iphicrates in the same degree as Cersobleptes to Charidemus; and
                    that the achievements of Iphicrates on behalf of Cotys were far more important
                    and meritorious than anything that Charidemus has done for Cersobleptes. Let us
                    consider it in this way. </p>

                    at the Town Hall, and other grants and distinctions. Nevertheless he had the
                    courage to fight a battle at sea against our commanders in defence of Cotys,
                    setting a higher value on the salvation of that king than upon all the honors he
                    enjoyed in your city. If your resentment had not been more restrained than his

                    danger, he took no pains to reward him, and never showed you any civility
                    through his agency in the hope of winning forgiveness for his past conduct. On

                    return to you, whom he had slighted for the sake of a Thracian and a barbarian.
                    On the other hand, he thought it dangerous to remain at the court of a king whom
                    he had found so negligent of his safety. </p>

            <div n="133" type="section">
                <p>Now suppose, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that
                    Cersobleptes also, having his power enhanced by the immunity that is being
                    procured for Charidemus, should disdain that man, and initiate plots and
                    disturbances against you,—are you content, as long as Charidemus is misled, to
                    have furnished the Thracian with strength to fight you? I hope not! Here is the
                    view that I think the just one: if Charidemus makes it his business to get these
                    decrees, after perceiving and foreseeing that peril, you must distrust him as an
                    intriguer. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="134" type="section">
                <p>On the other hand, if he has failed to discern the peril, the more you credit him
                    with good intentions, the more forethought you should exercise for his sake as
                    well as your own. Honest friends should not bestow upon their well-wishers such
                    favours as will bring disaster to both alike, but should rather cooperate in any
                    action that tends to their common advantage; and when a man is more far-sighted
                    than his friend, he should order things for the best, and not treat the
                    gratification of the moment as of more value than all future time. </p>

            <div n="135" type="section">
                <p>Moreover, I cannot discover on reflection that Cersobleptes, though both
                    barbarous and faithless, is likely to take any pains not to injure Charidemus so
                    seriously; for when I look backwards and observe the advantages of which Cotys
                    was going to deprive Iphicrates without the slightest consideration for him, I
                    really cannot think that Cersobleptes would trouble himself about the losses
                    that will fall on Charidemus. </p>

            <div n="136" type="section">
                <p>Cotys expected to rob Iphicrates of honors, of maintenance, of statues, of the
                    country that made him a man to be envied, I may almost say of everything that
                    made life worth living; yet he had no scruple. But, really, what is there of
                    which this man should be anxious not to deprive Charidemus? He has no
                    possessions whatsoever in your city,—neither children, nor a statue, nor
                    kindred, nor anything else. </p>

                    that should induce him, even against his judgement and his character, to promote
                    the welfare of Charidemus, for what reason should we, in sheer absolute
                    stupidity, help him to accomplish his desires, even to our own detriment? I see

                    fact it has been made for Charidemus, a man not domiciled in any free state at
                    all, but commanding an army for a Thracian and an autocrat, and maltreating

                    on a certain occasion, you gave your citizenship to Ariobarzanes,<note

                    and also, on his account, to Philiscus,—just as you have recently given it to
                    Charidemus for the sake of Cersobleptes. Philiscus, who resembled Charidemus in
                    his choice of a career, began to use the power of Ariobarzanes by occupying
                    Hellenic cities. He entered them and committed many outrages, mutilating
                    free-born boys, insulting women, and behaving in general as you would expect a
                    man, who had been brought up where there were no laws, and none of the
                    advantages of a free constitution, to behave if he attained to power. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="142" type="section">
                <p>Now there were two men in <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>, one
                    named Thersagoras and the other Execestus, who had formed views about tyranny
                    very much like those that prevail here. These men put Philiscus to death, as he
                    deserved, because they felt it their duty to liberate their own fatherland. Now
                    suppose that one of those orators who spoke on behalf of Philiscus, at a time
                    when he was paymaster of the mercenaries at Perinthus, when he held all the
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, and was the most
                    powerful of viceroys, had then, like Aristocrates today, moved a resolution that
                    whosoever killed Philiscus should be liable to seizure in allied territory. I
                    entreat you to reflect upon the depth of ignominy to which our city would have
                    fallen. </p>

                    and lived there. Well, if any son or any friend of Philiscus had laid hands on
                    them, they would have been given up to justice in pursuance of your decree; and
                    assuredly you would have been guilty of a shameful and a scandalous act if,
                    while ostentatiously setting up bronze statues of the men who performed a
                    similar feat in your own city, and loading them with unparalleled honors, you
                    had condemned to outlawry those who in some other country had exhibited the
                    selfsame spirit of patriotism. I am glad to say that, in the case of Philiscus,
                    it was not your fate to be ensnared and to incur that great dishonor; but in the
                    present case, if you will heed my warning, you will be very careful; for, if
                    there is no limiting clause and if the phrase “whosoever shall kill Charidemus”
                    is unqualified, it is quite possible that the outcome will be such as I have

                    this,—and I hope no one will take my pledge in bad part,—that I will satisfy
                    you, not only that he is unworthy of the protection proposed by the defendant,
                    but that he deserves to be most severely punished, if chastisement is justly due

                <p>I dare say that some of you, reflecting that the fellow has first been made a
                    citizen, and thereafter has been decorated with crowns of gold, are astonished
                    that it has been such an easy task to delude you so completely. Well, you may be
                    quite sure, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that you
                    have been deluded; and I will explain why such a result was to be expected. You

                    traders, or the silver-miners, or any class like those, but if any one named the
                    people who make speeches and move resolutions for hire, I am sure that your
                    assent would be unanimous. So far your judgement is excellent; but it is no

            <div n="147" type="section">
                <p>For it is on the very people whom you regard as most unprincipled that you rely

                    virtuous or wicked, not when the description is honest and true, but when it
                    brings money into their own pockets. And that is what the orators have
                    constantly done in respect of Charidemus, as you will agree when I have given
                    you an account of his past career. </p>

                    your allies. But I pass these things by. And for what reason? Because,
                    gentlemen, hard necessity does away with all consideration of what anyone should
                    or should not do; and therefore in such matters a candid examiner must not be
                    too fastidious. But let me tell you of the mischief he did to you at the outset

                <p>First of all, he was hired by Iphicrates, and drew pay in his army for more than
                    three years. When you had cashiered Iphicrates, and dispatched Timotheus as
                    commander-in-chief to <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>
                    and the <placeName key="tgn,7012057">Chersonesus</placeName>, the man's first
                    performance was to surrender to the Amphipolitans those hostages of theirs whom
                    Iphicrates had taken from Harpalus, and put under his care, although you had
                    ordered them to be conveyed to <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. That act prevented you from occupying <placeName

                    his turn wanted to hire him and his troops, he refused the engagement, and
                    repaired by sea to Cotys, taking with him your light galleys, though he was
                    perfectly well aware that Cotys was the most bitter enemy you had in the world.

                    the recent arrest of Artabazus by Autophradates, he hired out his forces and
                    himself to the sons-in-law of Artabazus. He had taken and given pledges, but he
                    ignored and broke his oaths, and, finding the inhabitants of the country, who
                    thought they were dealing with a friend, off their guard, he seized their towns,

                    even an ordinary person, not to say a man calling himself a commander, could
                    never have blundered. Although he held no position on the sea-coast, and had no
                    means of supplying his troops with provisions, and although he had no food in
                    the towns, he remained within the walls, instead of looting the towns and making
                    off in pursuance of his intention to do mischief. But Artabazus, having been
                    released by Autophradates, collected an army, and appeared on the scene; and he
                    could draw supplies from the friendly countries of upper <placeName

                    be reduced by famine, if by no other means, he made the discovery, whether by
                    suggestion or by his own wits, that his only chance of salvation lay where there
                    is salvation for everybody. And where is that? In your good-nature, if that is

                    to you,—and it is worth your while to hear it read. His desire was, by means of
                    a promise to recover the <placeName key="tgn,7012057">Chersonesus</placeName>
                    for you, and on the pretence that such was also the wish of Cephisodotus, as an

                <p>Do you remember the immediate sequel, by which the trick was exposed in the very
                    act? Memnon and Mentor, the sons-in-law of Artabazus, were young men, enjoying
                    unexpected good fortune by their relationship to Artabazus. What they wanted was
                    to govern the country peaceably without delay, and to win distinction without
                    warfare and peril. Accordingly, they persuaded Artabazus to forgo his vengeance
                    upon Charidemus, and to send him off under an armistice, advising him that you
                    would bring Charidemus across with or without his consent: he could not possibly
                    stop you. </p>

            <div n="158" type="section">
                <p>Having gained this unaccountable and unforeseen deliverance, Charidemus crossed

                    authority by reason of the armistice; but then, so far from attacking
                    Cotys,—although he had told you in his letter that Cotys would not repel his
                    attack,—and so far from helping you to recover the <placeName key="tgn,7012057"
                        >Chersonesus</placeName>, he entered the service of Cotys once more, and
                    began to beleaguer your last remaining strongholds, Crithote and Elaeus. You
                    will find proof in his route across the straits that he had already decided on
                    this action at the time when he was in <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                        >Asia</placeName> and was sending you the letter, and therefore that he was
                    cheating you; for he crossed from <placeName key="tgn,6000031"
                        >Abydus</placeName>, a place always hostile to you, and the base from which

                            <persName><surname>Pytho</surname></persName>; Cersobleptes, the present

                    control of affairs, because he was on the spot and had a force at his back.
                    Cephisodotus, the man to whom he sent the famous letter, had arrived in command
                    of an army, and so had the galleys, which were to have rescued him, even without

                    language of goodwill. At the outset we took anchorage at Perinthus with only ten
                    ships, having heard that he was in the neighborhood, and hoping to meet him and
                    talk matters over. He waited till our men were having their breakfast, and then
                    tried to take our ships, killed a number of our sailors, and hunted every man of

                    name or for any of his supporters, you in your turn cancelled the new
                    convention, and resolved, on the motion of Glauco, to elect ten citizens as
                    ambassadors. If Cersobleptes would abide by his covenant with Athenodorus, they
                    were to make him renew his oath;if not, they were to accept the oaths of the two

                <p>There is another plea of the same sort by which they hope to lead you off the
                    track. “Cersobleptes and Charidemus,” they will say, “did perhaps oppose
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at a time when they were
                    unfriendly; but now they are our friends, and wish to be useful friends. We
                    really must not be vindictive. When we were rescuing the Lacedaemonians, we
                    dismissed from our minds the injuries they had done to us as enemies; so too
                    with the Thebans, and, quite recently, with the Euboeans.” </p>
            </div>
            <div n="192" type="section">
                <p>—But I hold that this plea would have been rightly offered, if they had offered
                    it on some occasion when an expedition in relief of Cersobleptes and Charidemus
                    had been proposed, and we were trying to block it. But, as we have here no such
                    occasion and no such proposal, but only the argument of men trying to make
                    Cersobleptes more powerful than he deserves by means of an immunity received
                    from you by his generals, I regard their action as dangerous. It is not fair,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that the pleas of men

                <p>Apart from that, if he had injured you as an enemy, but had been reformed after
                    claiming to be your friend, such an excuse might, perhaps, have been acceptable;
                    but, inasmuch as that is not so, and as most of his deceptions fall after the
                    date of his profession of friendship, you ought to distrust him for his later,
                    if not to dislike him for his earlier, conduct. With regard, however, to not
                    being “vindictive,” I have this to say. The vindictive man is the man who hunts
                    up grievances in order to inflict injury; the man who bears them in mind in

                    consider it. If he were our friend honestly and in all sincerity, if he really
                    did intend to do us all manner of good, even then I should not think this
                    argument worthy of your attention. In my judgement there is no man who could
                    possibly do you so much service that for his sake you ought to perjure

                    it is his desire to be really on good terms with us, he will make a genuine
                    effort to serve us well, having discovered that he can no longer accomplish his
                    purposes by chicanery. For that reason alone, if for no other, you will do well

                    they showed their gratitude in a manner that was equally creditable to
                    themselves and the recipients. They were all men of merit, but they chose those

                <p>The truth is, gentlemen, that they would not rob themselves of their own share in

                    Themistocles,—it was the battle of the Athenians; or that the victory at

                    today, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is commonly
                    said that <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName> was captured by
                    Timotheus, that the Spartan battalion was cut to pieces by Iphicrates, that the

                    Chabrias. It really looks as though you disclaimed any merit for those feats of

                    liable to seizure; they made him a citizen, and thought that distinction
                    adequate. </p>

                    bestow upon him this immunity into the bargain? For what? What ships has he
                    taken for you, to cause the men who have lost them to plot against him? What
                    city has he captured and handed over to you? What perils has he encountered in
                    your defence? When has he chosen your enemies as his own? No man can tell you.

            <div n="215" type="section">
                <p>Before I leave the tribune, gentlemen of the jury, I wish to add some brief
                    observations upon the statutes that we have adduced. If you will bear them in
                    mind, I think that you will keep a better look-out for any attempts these men
                    may make to cajole and mislead you. The first statute expressly ordains that, if
                    any man slay another, the Areopagus shall take cognizance. Aristocrates proposes
                    that such a manslayer shall be liable to seizure without more ado. Mark that
                    carefully, and remember that to make a man an outlaw without trial is exactly
                    the opposite of trying him. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="216" type="section">
                <p>The second statute forbids personal maltreatment or extortion even in the case of
                    a convicted homicide. Aristocrates, by making him liable to seizure, has
                    permitted such misusage; for it will be competent for captors to treat the man
                    as they will. The statute provides that the culprit shall be conveyed to the
                    judges, even though arrested in the country of his victim. He allows the
                    homicide on seizure to be taken to the house of the prosecutor, even though the
                    capture be effected in foreign parts. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="217" type="section">
                <p>There are certain injuries for which the statute permits life to be taken.
                    Aristocrates, even though the life be taken in such circumstances, makes no
                    reservation, but permits a man whom the laws release without penalty to be
                    handed over for punishment. When a man has suffered this misfortune, the law
                    enjoins that satisfaction be first claimed. In defiance of this law he proposes
                    no trial, demands no redress from the persons on whom he has such claim, but
                    declares incontinently that the man is liable to seizure, and puts under an
                    immediate ban anyone who tries to rescue him. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="218" type="section">
                <p>The statute provides that not more than three hostages may be taken from the
                    people with whom the offender lives, if they refuse to give satisfaction. The
                    defendant puts under ban without more ado whosoever rescues the accused from his
                    captors because he is unwilling to surrender him before judgement. The statute
                    forbids anyone to introduce a new law without making it applicable to all men
                    alike; he composes a special decree in favour of a particular man. The statute
                    does not permit any decree to override the law. The relevant laws are many, but
                    Aristocrates annuls them all and makes a mere decree supreme. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="219" type="section">
                <p>Bear all this in mind and memory so long as you sit in that box. Dismiss all the
                    fallacious reasons they will allege; do not allow them to be uttered. Tell them
                    to show you the clause in which he has proposed a trial, or the clause that
                    punishes a man duly convicted of murder. If he had provided for the due
                    punishment of a man tried and found guilty elsewhere, or if he had himself
                    proposed a trial to determine whether homicide has been committed or not, and if
                    so whether justifiably or not, he would have done no wrong. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="220" type="section">
                <p>But inasmuch as, after a phrase of mere accusation, “if any man kills,” without
                    any such addition as “and is found guilty of murder,” or, “is adjudged to have
                    killed,” or, “he shall submit to judgement for the murder,” or, “he shall be
                    liable to the same penalty as if he had killed an Athenian,” he has omitted
                    every just precaution, and has simply made the man liable to seizure, do not be
                    led astray, but be assured that in this decree the laws have been absolutely
                    contravened.</p>
