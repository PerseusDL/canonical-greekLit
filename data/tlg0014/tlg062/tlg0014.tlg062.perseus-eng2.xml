			<head>Exordia</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="1"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The beginning of Philippic 1 (<bibl n="Dem. 4">Dem. 4</bibl>) differs but slightly from this.</note> If it had been proposed to discuss some new measure, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I should have waited until most of the regular speakers had declared their opinions, and if any of their views had pleased me, I should have held my peace; otherwise, I should then have attempted to say what I myself think. But since you are now considering matters on which these speakers have often spoken before, I feel that, even if the first to rise, I may reasonably appear to be speaking after them.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Now, if our interests were prospering, there would be no need to deliberate; but since, as you all observe, they are in straits, I shall try, on that assumption, to advise what I consider best. In the first place, you ought to recognize that none of the policies you pursued while engaged in the war are to be used henceforth, but quite their opposites.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Similar advice is given in <bibl n="Dem. 8.38">Dem. 8.38</bibl>. Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 2.23">Dem. 2.23</bibl>.</note> For if those policies have brought your fortunes low, it is very likely that their opposites will improve them.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">This advice is satirically tendered to Dionysus by Euripides in <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 1446">Aristoph. Frogs 1446-1450</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Next, you must consider that it is not the speaker who places upon you little or no burden who is in the right, for you see that, as a consequence of such optimistic speeches, our present condition has reached the limit of wretchedness, but rather the speaker who, putting aside the thought of pleasing you, shall tell you what ought to be done and by what means we may cease bringing disgrace upon ourselves and incurring losses.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The danger of speaking to please only is mentioned in <bibl n="Dem. 9.63">Dem. 9.63-64</bibl> and <bibl n="Dem. 3.3">Dem. 3.3</bibl>.</note> For, to speak truthfully, if all that a man passes over in his speech through reluctance to pain you is going to be passed over also by the course of events, it is right to harangue you for your pleasure; but if the charm of words, when unbecoming the occasion, becomes a penalty in action,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 4.38">Dem. 4.38</bibl>.</note> it is shameful to cheat yourselves, and to do only under the utmost necessity what you should have done voluntarily long before.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="2"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>The same thoughts do not present themselves to me, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, when I hear you refer by name to our form of government and again when I see the manner in which some of you treat those who speak in its defence. As you all know, the name you give to our government is democracy, but I see that some of you listen with more pleasure to those who advocate the opposite to it.</p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>I wonder just what their motive may be. Or do you imagine they are making these speeches gratis? Well, the masters of the oligarchies, whose cause these men are pleading, might quietly increase their fees.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">This is ironical, explaining <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόφασις</foreign>; virtual reported speech.</note> But honestly, have you assumed that their principles are better than the other kind? So oligarchy, presumably, looks better to you than democracy! Then do you think the men themselves are better? And yet who could reasonably be regarded by you as honest when he speaks in public against the interest of the established government? Therefore it remains to conclude that you are mistaken when you hold this opinion. Consequently, be on your guard against falling into this error, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, so that you shall not some day give those who are plotting against you an opening, and only then learn that you have made a mistake, when it will no longer be of the least advantage to you.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now, the fact that everything is not going as we might wish, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, either at home or among our allies, is perhaps not astonishing; for in many things the whim of Fortune prevails and there are many plausible reasons why everything does not turn out according to plan, men being but men. Yet for the common people to have no portion at all and their opponents a superabundance is something to astound and alarm intelligent men, as I judge it, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. This, then, is the starting point of my entire speech.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="3"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I believe, <note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The beginning of <bibl n="Dem. 1">Dem. 1</bibl> differs but slightly.</note> men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that in preference to a large sum of money you would choose the plan that will pay you in the matters you are now considering. This being so, it is then your duty to show yourselves willing hearers of your prospective counsellors; for not only in the event of someone having come here with a useful idea thought out, would you, having listened, have the benefit of it, but I also assume it to be part of your good fortune that many timely suggestions would occur to some men on the spur of the moment, so that from the whole number the choice of the advantageous is made easier for you.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="4"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>It is your duty, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to listen to every proposal made, since it is your prerogative to adopt whichever of them you choose. For it often happens that the same person is wrong on one point and right on another; and so by shouting him down when displeased you may perhaps deprive yourselves of many useful ideas, whereas by attending with decorum and in silence, you will act on every sound proposal, and if you think someone is making a foolish suggestion, you will ignore it. As for me, I am not accustomed to make long speeches, and even if previously I had been in the habit, I should not have taken this occasion to do so; instead, I shall tell you as briefly as I can what I consider to be in your interests.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="5"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I observe, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that there is no mistaking what kind of speeches you would like to hear and to what kind you are averse. Yet to say what one thinks will find favour I consider to be the badge of those who wish to work some deception, whereas to endure, when one is speaking for measures he is convinced are advantageous to the State, either your heckling or what else you choose to do, I judge to be the part of a loyal and honest citizen.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And I should like to have you bear patiently with the speeches of both sides to this end, if for no other, in order that, if someone shall be found to offer a proposal better than those upon which you are intent, you may avail yourselves of it, but, if he falls short and is unable to make his point, that he may seem to have suffered this repulse through his own fault and not because of your refusing to listen. Furthermore, your experience would not be so disagreeable if you should listen to some fool making a long speech as it would if you prevented a man from speaking who had something timely to propose.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>In all matters, of course, the first step toward right judgement is never to imagine you understand before learning, especially knowing as you do that many men before now have often changed their minds. If, then, you on your part are now convinced of these truths, I think that I on my part shall seem justified in speaking briefly in opposition and be found to propose the plans that are best for you.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="6"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Although many speeches have been made, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, by all your counsellors, I do not see that you are now any nearer to discovering what ought to be done than before you came up to the Assembly. The cause of this, in my opinion, is the same as the cause of the wretched plight of our affairs in general, that the speakers do not offer advice about the business before you, but accuse and revile one another, accustoming you, in my judgement, to hearing, without process of law, all the mischief of which they are the cause, in order that if, after all, they do come to face the test some day, you, thinking you are hearing nothing new, but only the charges over which you have often been angry, may so become more merciful jurors and judges of their misdeeds.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Perhaps it would be foolish at the moment to inquire into the exact reason why they do this; but because it harms you, for this reason I censure them. For my own part, I will accuse no one today nor will I sponsor any charge that I shall not make good on the spot, nor, in general, will I do any of the things which these men do; but when I have stated as briefly as I can what I think best for your interests and most profitable for you who deliberate, I will step down.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="7"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The beginning of <bibl n="Dem. 14">Dem. 14</bibl> is identical</note> Those who praise your forefathers, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in my judgement choose a charming theme upon which to speak, and yet I do not think they do a favour to those whom they extol. For instance, when they undertake to tell of the deeds of those men, to which no speaker could do justice, while winning for themselves a reputation for ability to speak, they cause the valor of those men to seem to their hearers less than had been supposed. As for me, I consider the greatest commendation of those heroes to be the test of time, for although a long interval has gone by, no others have been able to exhibit greater deeds than those performed by them, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>and I shall myself merely try to tell you after what manner I think you will be best able to make your preparations. For this is the situation; though we should all prove ourselves to be clever speakers, I know well that your interests would not be advanced in the slightest, but if just one speaker, no matter who, should come forward and be able to demonstrate convincingly what kind of preparation, and how great, and provided from what funds, would be to the State’s advantage, all our present apprehension is as good as dispelled. This I shall try to do, if, after all, I am able, having first told you briefly how my opinion stands with respect to our relations with the King.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, known also as <q type="emph">the great king</q></note></p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="8"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The beginning of <bibl n="Dem. 14">Dem. 14</bibl> is identical</note> Both parties seem to me to be in the wrong, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, both those who have supported the Arcadians and those who have supported the Spartans. For, just as if they had come here from one or the other of the two countries and were not of your own citizen body, to which both embassies are appealing, they are denouncing and abusing one another. This, however, was a concern of the visiting envoys, while to discuss the questions in the common interest and to consider your own interest without self-seeking is the duty of those who see fit to offer advice here in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Yet as things now are, if one could cancel the fact of their being known and their using the Attic speech, many people, I believe, would think the one group Arcadians and the other Spartans!</p> <p>I know myself how difficult it is to propose the best procedure, for when you have been deceived and some of you want this and others that, if someone undertakes to suggest a compromise and then you do not wait to learn the facts, he will please neither party and will be put in the wrong with both sides.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p></p> <p>Nevertheless, I shall choose to be thought to talk nonsense, if that, after all, is to be my fate, rather than to abandon you to certain people to be deceived in violation of what I consider best for you. And so, with your permission, I shall go into other details later, and proceed to explain what I think is best, starting from the premises upon which both sides agree.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="9"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I have taken the floor, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, because I do not hold the same views as some of those who have spoken. Still I shall not allege that these men out of villainy have expressed sentiments opposed to your best interests, but I say that many, while neglecting to judge events critically, make a practice of considering the words they will use, and if they chance to find an ample supply of these, of haranguing the people without more ado. In this they are wrong nor do they reflect in their own minds that, since it is the experience of all that over a long period many plans have worked out happily and some of them, because of the times, quite contrary to their promise, if some speaker cites the one kind and passes over the other, he will unconsciously be doing the easiest thing in the world, deceiving himself.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Now those who thus use the privilege of advising you seem to me to look upon the reputation for eloquence accruing to them from their speeches as an adequate ambition, but it is my opinion that the man who proposes to advise the State on matters of policy should rather consider how the measures adopted shall prove of benefit, and not how his remarks of the moment may find favour. For those who win esteem by their words ought to add to it the accomplishment of some useful work in order that not only now, but for all time, their utterances may have merit.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="10"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>If you have decided, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, what it is best to do in the circumstances, it is a mistake to propose debate; for why should you be needlessly bored by listening to what you have yourselves judged to be expedient before hearing it discussed? But if, assuming that you must reach a judgement on the basis of what shall be said, you are exploring and deliberating, it is wrong to stop those who wish to speak, since by so doing you are deprived entirely of whatever practical proposal some speakers have thought up, and you cause other speakers to abandon their own conclusions in favour of what they think you desire to hear.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>While to unite in forcing the speaker to express your wishes shows an intention to do wrong, the willingness to deliberate is proved when you listen to his views, scan them and, if any Is good, adopt it. I say this, not as one about to recommend measures opposed to those you are favouring, but as one who knows that, if you refuse to hear the opposition, they will say you have been deceived, while, if you do listen and are not persuaded, they will have been proved on the spot to be offering the worse proposals.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="11"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I think you all know, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that you have not come here today to put any of the wrongdoers on trial but to deliberate about the present state of affairs. So it is our duty to defer all accusations and only when we put someone on trial<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The Assembly sometimes acted as a court, for example, in cases of treason.</note> should this or that man speak before you against another who, he has convinced himself, is an offender. But if anyone has something practical or profitable to say, now is the time to declare it. For accusation is for those who have fault to find with past actions, but in deliberative session the discussion is solely about present and future actions. Therefore the present is no occasion for abuse or blame but for taking counsel together, it seems to me. For this reason I shall try to guard against falling myself into the error which I condemn in these men and to offer the advice that I think best in the present state of affairs.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="12"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I think that no man will deny, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that it is the mark of a disloyal citizen and a low-minded man so to hate or favour anyone who enters into public life that he takes no thought for the State’s best interests, but shapes his public utterances sometimes to vent his malice and sometimes to prove his friendship, as a number of those are doing who come forward here to speak. To these I would say no more than this: that in my opinion, if they have done something of the kind, their greatest offence is not this, but rather that they show themselves unprepared ever to stop doing it!</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>As for yourselves, I give you this advice: do not be guilty of self-ruin and think it enough if you punish these men when you see fit; but, while holding them in check so far as lies in your power, you must yourselves, as becomes men deliberating on behalf of the State, put aside your own private feuds and aim at what is most to the common good, reflecting that the punishment of no individual, nor even of all the politicians in a body, can square the account if once the laws should be destroyed on which your very life depends.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Or, less probably, <q type="translation">the laws of which you are in charge.</q></note></p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="13"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Perhaps it might seem offensive to certain persons, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if someone, an ordinary citizen and one of the common people like yourselves, should come forward after others who are eminent for both long political experience and reputation among you have already stated their opinions, and say that he thinks the others are not only wrong but not even near to discerning what ought to be done. Nevertheless, I feel so confident that I am going to give more profitable counsel than theirs that I shall not hesitate to declare all they have said to be worthless. I think that you too would be doing well if you kept in view, not the speaker, but the advice being offered. For the right thing, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is to extend your goodwill, not to certain persons as though by hereditary privilege, but to those who from time to time offer the best counsel.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="14"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I should like you to listen attentively to what I am going to say, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; it is not unimportant. I wonder just why it is that, before we come up to the Assembly, any one of you whom a person may chance to meet is prepared to say readily by what means the present state of affairs may be improved; and then again, the minute you leave the Assembly, each man will be just as ready to say what we ought to do. But when we are met together and dealing with these problems, you hear anything rather than this from certain speakers.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Then has each one of you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the gift of deciding what ought to be done, and does each know how to state the duties of the rest, while he is reluctant himself to do his own, and then again, does each man as an individual, as if to give the impression of being one who would of course promptly do what is best, find fault with everyone else, but as a body are you committed to fighting shy of voting such measures as will ensure that you will one and all become engaged in performing some duty to the State?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Well then, if you really think that no crisis will arrive to make a breach in this fence of evasiveness, it would be grand to carry on after this fashion. But if you see your troubles drawing nearer, you must plan that you shall not have to grapple with them at close range when it is possible to forestall them from a distance, and that you shall not have those whom you now disregard exulting later on at your discomfiture</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="15"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As for the problems now confronting the State, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, even though things are not as they should be, I do not consider it altogether difficult to discover by what action one may effect an improvement. I judge, on the other hand, that the manner in which I must speak to you about them means very grave irritation; not because you will fail to understand what a person will say but because you seem to me to have become so accustomed to hearing many untruths and anything rather than what best meets your needs, that I fear it may be the lot of the man who now makes the best proposal to earn for his reward at your hands the hostility which would properly have been the due of those who have deceived you.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For I observe that often you hate, not those who are to blame for your troubles, but those who have most recently made mention of them to you.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 1.16">Dem. 1.16</bibl>.</note> Nevertheless, although I am so precisely measuring this hazard, I still think that I must put all other subjects aside and confine myself to saying what I think is the best advice about the present situation.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="16"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I should have wished, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that you treat yourselves with that benevolence which you are accustomed to practise toward all other peoples. As it now is, you are better at rectifying the woes of others than you are at taking to heart the troubles which befall yourselves. Someone may perhaps say, of course, that this is exactly what brings the greatest glory to the State—to have deliberately chosen to assume many risks for the sake of sheer justice with no thought of selfish advantage. Now, while I for one believe this reputation which prevails concerning the State to be true and desire it to be, yet I assume it also to be an obligation of prudent men to exercise as much foresight in their domestic affairs as in those of strangers, so that you may show yourselves to be not only men of goodwill but sensible also.</p> </div></div>

For I do not think it due to any lack of speeches that now once more you observe all your affairs to be in a muddle, but the reason is that some are orating and playing politics for their own gain, and others, who have so far not given evidence of this offence, are more concerned to be thought good speakers than that some concrete good may be effected by what they say. As for me, that I may not unwittingly do the opposite of what I myself say is right, and say more about other matters than about those of which I have risen to speak, I shall disregard all other topics and endeavor to tell you forthwith what I recommend.</p> </div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>I, at any rate,—so help me Heaven—after it occurred to me to reflect upon our present problems, began to hit upon themes, and no end of them, to which you would have listened not without pleasure.

As for me, although I should have thought it proper to remain silent on this occasion had I observed you abiding by your previous decisions—for I am one of those who are convinced that these are to your advantage—yet, now that certain members seem to have changed their minds because of the speeches made by these men, even though you perhaps know that what they say is neither true nor for your good, I will nevertheless make this clear in case you are unaware of it.</p> </div></div>

I should like to ask them—and what I am about to say is not to become the signal for any tirade—just why, since they praise the Spartans in all other respects, they do not imitate the most admirable of all their practices, but rather do the very opposite.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For they say, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that among them each man airs any opinion he may have until the question is put, but when the decision has been ratified, they all approve it and work together, even those who opposed it.

For, to begin with, Fortune—to whom be thanks—arranges much of your business to take care of itself, so well that you would pray for nothing better, because little of it would be in good shape through such foresight as is exercised by those in authority. Next, you know in advance, not only what speeches each man will make, but also with what motives each one harangues you, and if it were not spiteful, I should also have said, for what price.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>I think you are prudent in reducing to a minimum the time for being cheated. If I were intending to speak in the same vein as the rest, I should not have thought it necessary to bore you by speaking.

Listen and examine it, and, if it pleases you, adopt it.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="37"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I shall make the beginning of my speech both short and reasonable, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, nor shall I deliver the whole of it. For I believe that, while it is the way of a man who intends deception to cast about for a plan whereby he may conceal from you, his hearers, by means of his words the disagreeable aspects of the situation, on the other hand, the first duty of a man who has resolved to deal candidly with you is to declare which side he has come forward to endorse, in order that, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>if after hearing this statement you are willing to hear the sequel, he may enlighten you and explain what measures seem best to himself, but if you shall reject his views, that he may have done with the matter and neither annoy you nor tire himself out.</p> <p>This, then, will be my first statement: It is my opinion that the democratic party in <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName> has been wronged and that it is your duty to obtain justice for them.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The democracy was overthrown in <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName> after the Social War in <date when="-0355">355</date> B.C.: <bibl n="Dem. 13.8">Dem. 13.8</bibl> and <bibl n="Dem. 15.19">Dem. 15.19</bibl>.</note> For obtaining this justice I have a plan to propose when once I have demonstrated that they have been wronged and that it is your duty to go to their aid.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="38"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>First of all, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is not altogether surprising that those who wish to tender you advice do not readily find the words, because, when the conditions that require consideration are bad, it is inevitable that the recommendations made concerning them should also be disagreeable. Of course, if by your refusing to listen there is hope of this situation becoming better, that is the thing to do, but if everything is going to get worse and nothing better by so doing, why should you, having allowed things to come to the worst, after a longer interval than has now elapsed, and with greater difficulty, try to save the situation, though, starting from present conditions, it is still possible even now to set things to rights and effect a change for the better?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p></p> <p>Certainly it is reasonable for you to feel angry after these unhappy experiences; but to vent your anger, not upon the parties responsible, but upon everybody in turn, ceases to be either reasonable or right: because those who are in no way responsible for past events but can tell you how an improvement may be effected for the future would rightly meet with gratitude, not hostility, from you. If you treat these men with untimely irritation, you will make them hesitate to rise and speak.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And yet I am myself not unaware that often it is the lot, not of those who are guilty, but of persons who get in the way of those who are angry, to suffer unpleasant consequences. In spite of this I have risen to advise you, for I have confidence myself that I shall not be found to be advocating any inferior measure, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but have really better proposals to offer you than other speakers.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="39"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>The events that have occurred, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are such as you have all heard, but you must not allow yourselves to be at all dismayed, reflecting that to be discouraged in the face of the present troubles is neither improving the situation nor worthy of yourselves. On the contrary, to consider it incumbent on yourselves to set these things to rights would manifestly be in keeping also with your reputation. Men such as you would profess to be should prove themselves superior to other breeds in times of stress.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>As for me, I should by no means have wished these calamities to come upon the city nor yet for you to suffer misfortune, but if, after all, this had to happen and was in store as something predestined, I consider it to your profit that these events have occurred just as they have. For the dispensations of Fortune exhibit sharp reversals and impartial visitations to both sides, whereas the events that follow upon the villainy of men make for sure defeat.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now, while I am of the opinion that even those who have gained the upper hand are not unaware that, should you form your resolve and be stung to action by what has happened, it is not yet quite clear whether what has been done is good fortune or the opposite for them, yet if it turns out that the exploit has inspired them to become over-confident, this would already be another point in your favour. For the more they look down upon you, the sooner will they blunder.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="40"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I do not believe, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that you are deliberating upon this occasion concerning only the city you have in mind, but concerning all the allied cities. For however you decide concerning the city in question, the other cities, looking to this decision, will probably expect to receive the same treatment themselves. Consequently you must, for the sake both of doing what is best and of guarding your own reputation, strive earnestly that you may be clearly seen to be devising measures which are alike expedient and just.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p></p> <p>Now, the initiative in all such matters is in the hands of the generals. Most of these men, though they sail out under your orders, do not consider it their duty to cultivate those who are friendly to you, people whom they have taken over from their predecessors as men who have shared the same dangers as you throughout all our history, but each and all, having established their own private friendships, expect you to regard their personal flatterers as your friends also. But the facts are exactly the opposite.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>You could find no more bitter or inevitable enemies than these flatterers. For the more gains they make by deception, the greater is the number of offences for which they think they are due to be punished. And no one could feel goodwill toward those at whose hands he expects to suffer some harm. However, the present is perhaps not the time to denounce them. Instead, I shall give you the advice that I consider in your interests.</p> </div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="41"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I no not suppose, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that there is one of all your number so disloyal to the city as not to feel distressed and pained by these events. If, then, it were possible by nursing indignation to render undone any of the things that have been done, this is what I should be urging upon you all. But since the facts are unalterable and you must take forethought whereby you may escape the same misfortune in the future, the keenness of your indignation, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, over what has now taken place ought to set the measure for your determination that the same shall not occur again, nor should you think that any of your advisers has such a wonderful plan to propose as will be capable of redressing the present evils without any of you shouldering a share of the burden. For no speech would be wonderful enough for that, only some divine intervention.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p></p> <p>Now the origin of this present state of affairs hinges upon this fact, that, for the sake of a momentary popularity with you, some of those who speak in this place declared to the Assembly: <q type="spoken">There is no need to pay a special war-tax or to do military service, but everything will take care of itself.</q> To be sure, the absurdity of this ought to have been exposed by some other speaker—the sort of exposure that profits the State: still, even as things now are, it seems to me that Fortune is somehow kinder to you than are those at the head of affairs.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For while the occurrence of one loss after another ought to be counted evidence of the villainy of those who are in charge, the fact that all your resources have not been destroyed long ago I, at least, judge to be a benefaction of the Fortune that attends you. In the interval, therefore, while Fortune allows a respite and is holding your foes in check, have a care for what lies in the future. Otherwise take heed lest at one and the same time you shall be bringing to justice those who have been appointed to the several posts, and your power, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, shall be declining; for it is impossible that this shall continue to stand, barring some miracle, if not one of you puts his hand to the task.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 3.35">Dem. 3.35-36</bibl>.</note></p> </div></div>

On the contrary, one might much more reasonably be astonished that you, though aware of the truth, repeatedly prefer to listen to them rather than to those who speak in your own defence. It may very well be that it is difficult to act wisely in all public matters, just as it is in private matters, but certainly it is wrong to take a light view of things of the very greatest importance.</p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Assuredly all other considerations are of less consequence, and when you listen good-naturedly to speeches on behalf of government efficiency<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">There is an ironical touch in <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτείας</foreign> as if implying that oligarchy was the ideal form of government to those whose phrases he here quotes.</note> and killings and the overthrow of democracy, how can one help but consider that you too are out of your minds?

<div type="textpart" subtype="exordium" n="43"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Perhaps none of you has ever inquired, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, just why men in adversity deliberate more wisely over their affairs than do the prosperous. This comes about for no other reason than this, that it is not natural for the prosperous to feel any alarm or to believe that such dangers as someone may report concern themselves; those, however, who are close in time to the mistakes through which they have come to adversity are rendered discreet with reference to future actions and inclined to moderation.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt"><bibl n="Aesch.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>It therefore becomes serious-minded men at the very time that they enjoy the presence of Fortune at her best to show the greater eagerness to practise discretion.

I say this, not to frighten you needlessly, but in order that, when you hear rumors of danger, you may not despise them because of your present prosperity—they may come true unless you take forethought for your interests— but rather in order that, without waiting to learn by experience, you may forestall trouble, just as becomes men who at least claim to be second to none in point of discretion.</p> </div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I assume, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that the time for humoring you and the time for recommending the measures I regard as best are not the same; for often, I observe, humoring you contrary to one’s own judgement has earned more hatred than opposing at the outset. Now, if you all held the same opinions, I should not have come forward if you seemed to me to prefer the right course, considering it superfluous to speak before people doing the right thing of their own accord, nor again, if the contrary were true, for I should have thought that a lone person like myself was more likely to misapprehend the best measures than all of you.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But since I see some of you holding the same views as myself and the opposite to those held by others, I shall try with the support of these to persuade those who differ. Now, if you shall think it right to refuse to listen, you will make a mistake; but if you will listen in silence and bear with me in this, one of two benefits will accrue to you: for either you will be persuaded if we seem to advocate something advantageous, or you will be more firmly convinced of the rightness of your own views; for if the grounds upon which we think you are going somewhat astray shall be proved valueless, with the benefit of argument you will this time have chosen the plans approved before.</p> </div></div>

What is more, I do not believe that even these men would lie to you with such effrontery if they were not aware of this, and if it were not clear in advance that of all people you are the most addicted to listening to whatever anyone may say against you.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Apart from these two possibilities, there is a suspicion, and by no means to your credit, that, although you have come to the assembly under obligation to choose the best plan on the basis of what shall be said, instead, you will be found, before reaching a judgement on the basis of the speeches, to have been convinced of something in your own minds, and this so strongly that you are not even willing to hear anything to the contrary.</p> </div></div>

For if those men had done at the outset what you enjoined, it would not have been necessary for us to speak a second time or, if they had complied on the second occasion, a third time. As it is, the more often you have voted what your duty demanded, the less those men, it seems to me, have been prepared to act upon it.</p></div>

For the officials, or some of them— to avoid saying all—feel not even the slightest regard for your decrees but consider how they shall make some gain. Certainly, if it had been feasible for me to make a payment, I might have been justly rebuked for this very reason, if I chose to annoy you through balking at a paltry expenditure.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>In my opinion, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, no intelligent citizen would deny that it is best of all for the city, preferably at the outset not to do anything inexpedient, but otherwise, that those should be on hand who will object at once. To this must be added, however, that you shall be willing to listen and learn; for nothing is gained by having a man who will give the best counsel unless he shall have people who will listen to him.</p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Neither would the following suggestion prove unprofitable as the next step, that whatever deceptions anyone shall practise upon you through some well-timed maneuver,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Demosthenes in <bibl n="Dem.

For it would be a shocking thing that those who had failed to choose the best plan should be forced to put the worst into effect, and not have a chance to reconsider and choose from among other alternatives the plan that had stood second.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now while all other men, I observe, stand ready to submit to an accounting at any time, whenever they are confident that some measure of theirs has been honestly put through,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">This principle was invoked against Aeschines: <bibl n="Dem. 19.2">Dem. 19.2</bibl>.</note> yet these men, on the contrary, resent it if you desire now to reverse your action in matters wherein you have made a mistake, thinking their deception ought to prevail rather than spend time on an inquiry. So, even if the majority of you are perhaps not unaware of pressure on the part of these men, it is still one’s duty, once he has been given the floor, to declare what action he thinks best under the circumstances.</p> </div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Whatever measure is going to benefit the whole State, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I pray that all speakers will propose and you will adopt. I, at any rate, shall say what I have persuaded myself is most to your advantage, asking only this of you—that you neither consider those who urge you to take the field to be for this reason brave, nor those who undertake to oppose them to be for this reason cowards; for the test of speech and the test of action, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are not the same; rather we must now show ourselves to have been wise in counsel and later, if in the end this proposal is adopted, display the deeds of courage.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Your enthusiasm, I allow, is worthy of all praise and such as a man of goodwill toward the State might pray for; but the more intense your enthusiasm the more foresighted you should now be to employ it as you ought.

I am sure I once heard here in your presence, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, a man who was thought to be lacking neither in sense nor in experience of war.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I refer to Iphicrates,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Iphicrates died in <date when="-0353">353</date> B.C. when Demosthenes was about thirty years of age.

The meaning of this was obvious, for he meant <q type="emph">that he might come off victorious.</q> So, when you take the field, whoever is leader is master of you, but now each one of yourselves is a general. Thus it is your duty to show yourselves to have made such decisions as will inevitably be good for the State and that you shall not, for the sake of mere hopes of future goods, bring about something not so good as the prosperity you at present enjoy.</p> </div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I should have thought, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that no one who has a clean conscience about the measures taken would prefer a complaint against those who move to bring these matters to an accounting; for the more often one examines into them, the more the authors of them are bound to grow in esteem. These men themselves, however, seem to me to render it manifest that they have not acted with the State’s interests in view. At any rate, just as if they were bound to be found guilty if they should come again to an accounting, they assume the defensive and say we are acting outrageously. And yet when you accuse of outrageous conduct those who wish to investigate, what are we citizens to say of those who in that very transaction have perpetrated a fraud against our own selves?</p> </div></div>

That these designs have fallen short of success, credit is due to Fortune and to the fact that you are now wiser than when you were misled by these men. Yet the State, I believe, is so far from being able to exact justice of the wrongdoers, that it seems to me you must content yourselves if you shall be able to avoid sustaining loss; so formidable are the trickeries and chicaneries and, not to particularize, certain salaried public services<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπηρεσίαι</foreign> denotes services to which pay was attached; in all such the people took an avid interest, leaving unpaid offices to the wealthy: see <bibl n="Dem.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For on the one hand, these men, the kind who hold office year after year, when earnest and upright men from a different class were given them as yokemates, used to show themselves more circumspect; and on the other hand, the kind of men among you who are honest and upright in office, but not at all of the sort to push their way and appeal for support, were not shut out of the posts of trust. But now, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you appoint your magistrates in exactly the same manner as you appoint your priests.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">While some priesthoods were subject to choice by lot, <bibl n="Dem. 59.106">Dem. 59.106</bibl>, the majority of them were perhaps hereditary, <bibl n="Dem. 59.104">Dem. 59.104</bibl>, and the reference is to these.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>It seems to me a fine and seemly thing, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, for a man who has convinced himself he has something profitable to say to take the floor, but I consider it altogether shameful to force people to listen against their will.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>What, then, do I advise? First of all, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to require the man who comes forward to confine himself to the matters you are considering. For otherwise someone may embrace many other topics in his speech and say many witty things, especially those who are smart at it, as some of these are. Well, if you have come here to listen to fine phrases, the thing to do is to make them and listen to them, but if you have come to deliberate about a choice of measures, I urge you to judge the measures strictly by themselves, eliminating all passages of a nature to mislead.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>This, then, is my first point. My second, which to some of you will perhaps be inconsistent with cutting the speeches shorter, is that you listen in silence. For on the question whether this or that is expedient and which choice the State might more rightly prefer, there are few arguments to be presented, unless by such persons as wish to prattle aimlessly, nor would anyone have occasion to state them a second time. As for the claim that it is only fair to listen to the heckling,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">This seems to refer to genuine heckling and not to organized interruption as in <bibl n="Dem. 13.20">Dem. 13.20</bibl> and <bibl n="Dem. 2.29">Dem. 2.29</bibl>.</note> and to give an answer and to make speech after speech, there is no one who could not do that. Thus by heckling you do not get rid of speeches; instead you are forced in addition to hear speeches that are totally irrelevant. Accordingly my judgement concerning the matter before you now begins.</p> </div></div></div>
