  <head>On Political Harmony</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent"><note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Citations from sects. 6 and 12 of this letter are found in Bekker’s <title>Anecdota</title>, Antiatticista pp. 111. 31. and 110. 5, a lexicographical work. This is evidence for authenticity.</note> For one who is about to take any serious step, whether in speech or action, I assume that the proper course is to take his beginning from the gods. Accordingly I entreat all the gods and goddesses that what is best for the democracy of the Athenians and for those who bear goodwill toward the democracy, both now and for time to come, I may myself be moved to write and the members of the Assembly to adopt. With this prayer, having hopes of good inspiration from the gods, I address this message.</p> <p rend="center">Demosthenes to the Council and the Assembly sends greeting.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">Concerning the question of my return<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Demosthenes is writing from exile on the island of Calauria south of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, <date when="-0323">323</date> B.C.</note> to my native land I always bear in mind that it will be for you as a body to decide; consequently I am writing nothing about it at the present moment. Observing, however, that the present occasion, if you but choose the right course, is capable of securing for you at one stroke glory and safety and freedom, not for yourselves alone but for all the rest of the Greeks as well, but that, if you act in ignorance or be led astray, it would not be easy to secure the same opportunity again, I thought I ought to place before the public the state of my opinion on these questions.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>It is a difficult thing, I know, for advice conveyed by letter to hold its ground,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Isocrates enlarges upon this difficulty, <bibl n="Isoc. L. 1.2">Isoc. L. 1.2-3</bibl> and <bibl n="Isoc. 5.25">Isoc. 5.25-26</bibl></note> because you Athenians have a way of opposing many suggestions without waiting to understand them. In the case of a speaker, of course, it is possible to perceive what you want and easy to correct your misapprehensions; but the written page possesses no such aid against those who raise a clamor. In spite of this fact, if you will but consent to listen in silence and have the patience to learn all that I have to say, I think that,—to speak in the hope of divine favour—brief though the writing is, I shall myself be found to be doing my duty by you with all goodwill and that I shall demonstrate clearly where your interests lie.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Not as supposing you were running short of speakers, or of those, either, who will say glibly and without real thought what happens to occur to them, did I decide to send the letter; but I desired, after putting plainly before those who like to make speeches all that I happen to know through experience and long association with public business, first, to furnish them with ample means of arriving at what I deem to be your interests, and second, to render easy for the people the choice of the best procedures. Such, then, were the considerations that prompted me to write the letter.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">First of all, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is necessary that you bring about harmony<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Cicero saturated his mind with the writings of Demosthenes. <q type="emph">Political harmony</q> will be recognized as his political ideal: <title>Ad Atticum</title> 1. 14. 4; his friend Demitrius of Magnesia wrote on the subject: ibid. 8. 11. 7. The Romans deified this abstraction under the name <placeName key="tgn,1019348">Concordia</placeName></note> among yourselves for the common good of the State and drop all the contentions inherited from previous assemblies and, in the second place, that you all with one mind vigorously support your decisions, since the failure to follow either a uniform policy or to act consistently is not only unworthy of you and ignoble but, in addition, involves the greatest risks.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Those things must not escape your attention either, which, though by themselves they are not sufficient to effect your purpose, yet when added to your military forces, will render all your aims much easier of accomplishment. To what, then, do I refer? Toward no city and toward none of the citizens in this or that city who have supported the existing order<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> were forced to set up pro-Macedonian governments after the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName> in <date when="-0338">338</date> B.C. A Macedonian garrison was stationed in <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>. <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> was less harshly treated but outspoken advocates of freedom were out of favour.</note> must you harbor any bitterness<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">πικραίνεσθαι</foreign> is cited as used by Demosthenes, Bekker, 1. p. 111. 31.</note> or bear a grudge.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Because the fear of such animosity causes those who are conscious of guilt in their own hearts, because necessary to the existing order and facing a manifest danger, to be zealous supporters of it, but relieved of this fear they will all become more amenable, and this is of no slight usefulness. Now, to proclaim such intentions in the various cities would be foolish, or rather quite impossible, but in whatever spirit you shall be seen treating your own fellow-citizens, such will be the expectation you will create in the minds of each group concerning your feeling toward the rest also.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Accordingly I say that in general you must not cast any blame or censure whatsoever upon any general or orator or private individual of the groups that are believed, at least previously, to have supported the existing order, but rather concede to all parties in the city that they have done their duty as public men, inasmuch as the gods, to whom be thanks, by saving the city have bestowed upon you the privilege of deciding afresh whatever you shall choose to do, and you must be of the opinion that, just as on board a ship, when some declare themselves for making good their escape by the sail and others by the oars, just as all proposals of both parties aim at salvation, so it is to meet a crisis created by the gods that the need has arisen.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>If you shall have made up your minds to regard past events in this way, you will gain the confidence of all and play the part of good and honorable men; you will also further your own interests not a little and will cause your opponents in the various cities either to change their minds, all of them, or will cause only a certain very small number of them, the ringleaders themselves, to be left. Acquit yourselves, therefore, with magnanimity and statesmanship in the general interest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and bear in mind your own interests as Athenians.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The implication is that the interests of the Athenians coincide with the good of all, but the editors add <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign>: <q type="translation">Do not think of your own interests.</q></note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">I urge you to this line of conduct, though I have not myself met with such generosity from certain persons but have been unjustly and in a spirit of faction tossed off<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The odd metaphor derives from the reckless giving of presents in connection with the drinking of toasts at banquets. Lexicon under <foreign xml:lang="grc">προπίνω</foreign>.</note> for the gratification of others. I do not think, however, that I have the right while satisfying my private resentment to hurt the public interest, nor do I at all mix my private enmity with the general good. On the contrary, the conduct I urge upon the rest of men I think I ought to be myself the first to practise.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">Now, the steps to be taken by way of preparation and the mistakes to be guarded against, and the measures by which one might, as human calculations go, most likely succeed, have been, for practical purposes, stated by me; but how to oversee our business from day to day and how to deal rightly with situations that arise unexpectedly, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>how to know the right moment for each action and to judge which of our objectives it is possible to attain through negotiation<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Under the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμιλία</foreign> this passage is cited by Bekker, 1. p. 110. 4-6.</note> and which requires force in addition, these are the responsibility of the generals in charge. Therefore to give advice is to be in a very difficult position, because decisions that have been rightly taken and weighed with great care and pains are often spoiled through faulty execution on the part of those in authority.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>Yet I hope that all will be well this time; for if any man has assumed that Alexander was fortunate because he always succeeded,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Plutarch wrote an essay entitled <q type="title">Whether the success of Alexander was due to luck or ability.</q></note> let him reflect upon the fact that it was by doing and toiling and daring, not by sitting still, that he continued to be fortunate. Now, therefore, since Alexander is dead, Fortune is seeking some people with whom to co-operate, and you ought to become her choice.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>As for your leaders, through whom your interests must necessarily be handled, place at the head of your forces men whose loyalty is the greatest available, and as for yourselves, let every man of you repeat to himself a solemn promise to perform whatever he in particular shall be able and shall elect to do. And see to it that he does not break this pledge or shirk his responsibility, saying that he was deceived or misled and overpersuaded, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>because you will never find others to make good the lack of those qualities in which you yourselves shall fall short; neither does it involve the same danger to change your minds often about matters wherein it will be in your power to do as you please as it does about matters over which war will arise; but in the case of the latter a change of mind means defeat of your purpose. So do nothing of this kind, but whatever you intend to execute honestly and promptly with your whole souls, vote for that, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>and once you have passed a decree, adopt as your leaders Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> and the rest of the gods, who have uttered in your interest many splendid, encouraging and true oracles, and summon them to your aid and after you have prayed to all of them for success with a vow of the fruits of victory,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Mar. 26">Plut. Marius 26</bibl> <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔξατο τοῖς θεοῖς κατὰ ἑκατόμβης</foreign>, <q type="translation">He prayed to the gods for victory, taking a vow to sacrifice a hecatomb.</q></note> with good fortune attending you, proceed to liberate the Greeks. Farewell.</p></div></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="letter" n="2">
  <head>Concerning His Own Restoration</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="center"><note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Three citations of this letter may be found in Walz’s <title>Rhetores Graeci</title>, which will be mentioned in the footnotes. Harpocration refers to sect. 20 under the name <title>Calauria</title>.</note> Demosthenes to the Council and the Assembly sends greeting</p> <p rend="indent">I used to believe, because of my conduct in public life, that, as one who was guilty of no wrong toward you, I should not only never meet with such treatment as this<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The opening sentence down to this point is cited by <bibl>Hermog. Rhet. Graec. 3</bibl>, p. 349.</note> but, even if I should have committed some slight offence, that I might meet with forgiveness. Since, however, it has turned out as it has, so long as I observed you, without any manifest proof or even a scrutiny of evidence on the part of the Council,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">In <bibl n="Plut. Dem. 26">Plut. Dem. 26</bibl>, Plutarch informs us that the trial took place before the Areopagus. This was in the spring of <date when="-0324">324</date> B.C. The exile lasted a year.</note> condemning all the accused on the strength of the unrevealed information of that body, I chose to make the best of it, thinking that you were surrendering rights no less valuable than those of which I was being deprived. Because, for the jurors under oath to assent to whatever the Council should declare, without any proof having been cited, that was a surrender of a constitutional right.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Since, however, you have happily become aware of the undue ascendancy. which certain members of the Council were contriving for themselves and since you are now deciding the cases in the light of the proofs and have found the secretiveness of these men deserving of censure, I think it is my right, with your consent, to enjoy the same acquittal as those who have incurred the like accusations, and not to be the only one to be deprived on a false charge of his fatherland, his property, and the company of those who are nearest and dearest to him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">And you would have good reason, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to be concerned about my deliverance, not only for the reason that I have been outrageously treated, though guilty of doing you no wrong, but also for the sake of your good name abroad. For you must not imagine, just because no one reminds you of those times and occasions upon which I was of the greatest service to the city, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>that the rest of the Greeks are not aware of them or have forgotten what I have accomplished in your behalf. At the present moment I hesitate to write of these services in detail for two reasons; one reason is that I am afraid of jealousy, in the face of which it is useless to speak the truth; the second is this, that because of the cowardice of the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> we are now compelled to do many things that are below the standard of those services of mine.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>In brief, however, the record upon which I passed scrutiny as your servant was of such a kind as to make you envied by all because of it and myself confident in the greatest rewards from you. And when Fortune, as irresistible as she was unkind, decided as she pleased, and not according to justice, the struggle<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The reference is to the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>, <date when="-0338">338</date> B.C.</note> for the liberty of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in which you engaged, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>not even in the times that followed did I retreat from my loyalty toward you, nor did I bargain for anything in place of it, no man’s favour, no hopes of preferment, nor wealth, nor power, nor personal safety. Yet I observed that all these prizes were accruing to those who chose to play the game of politics to your detriment.</p></div>
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">Now one fact which is especially significant—although there are many significant facts which, it occurs to me, would justify me in speaking frankly—I shall not refrain from writing to you: although of men who are mentioned in history in all time, Philip had the most uncanny ability of all, whether through personal contact to persuade men to pay heed to his wishes or to corrupt with bribes the notable men in every one of the Greek cities, I was the only man who did not fall a victim to either of these methods, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>a fact that brings to you also cause for pride, and although I met Philip often and parleyed with him on those matters on which you sent me as envoy,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Demosthenes was one of ten envoys who negotiated with Philip the Peace of Philocrates in <date when="-0346">346</date> B.C. and was several times sent on similar missions afterwards.</note> yet I kept my hands off the substantial sums he offered me, as many men are aware who still live. Just ponder what opinion these men may reasonably entertain of you, for to have dealt this treatment to such a man, while for myself I am sure it would seem a misfortune, though no conviction of vice, yet on your part it would seem defiance of justice.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">This sentence is cited by Hermogenes, <title>Rhetores Graeci</title> 3, p. 235 and by Maximus Planudes, ibid. 5, p.395.</note> I beg of you to change your verdict and cancel this imputation.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">All the considerations which I have mentioned above, however, I consider of less importance than my conduct from first to last and every day in public life, in which I showed myself in action to be a statesman, never encouraging any nursing of a grudge or a feud or the grasping for unfair advantage, whether shared or for myself, never preferring false charges against either citizen or alien, never being over-clever to work in secret against your interests but always working for them, if occasion should arise, and above board, subject to public approval.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>The older men would know—and in all fairness you ought to inform the younger ones—of the hearing granted Python<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Python, pupil of Isocrates and a presumptuous orator headed a deputation of all the Allies of Philip when they come to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in <date when="-0343">343</date> B.C. to accuse the people of unjust conduct. See <bibl n="Dem. 7.20">Dem. 7.20-23</bibl>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.136">Dem. 18.136</bibl>, <bibl n="Plut. Dem. 9">Plut. Dem. 9</bibl>, and <bibl>Lucian Encomium 32</bibl>.</note> of <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> before the Assembly when he arrived with the envoys from the Greeks, expecting to show that the city was acting unjustly, but went away with the tables turned against him after I, alone of those who spoke on that occasion, had brought out the rights of the matter in your defence. I forbear to mention all the embassies upon which I served in support of your interests, in which you were never worsted even in a single instance; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>for I shaped my policy, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, not with an eye to helping you get the better of one another, nor whetting the State against itself, but furthering measures from which I thought a reputation for magnanimity would redound to you. With such aspirations you should all be delighted, and especially the younger men, not looking for someone who will always play the lackey to win your favour in his public conduct—for of this type there will never be a dearth—but for one who, actuated by loyalty, will even rebuke you for your errors of judgement.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">Now I pass over many other considerations, on the strength of which a different kind of a man and with no other service to his credit would justly demand to obtain acquittal; I mean the equipping of choruses and triremes and the contributing of money on all occasions.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Prosperous citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> were required from time to time to contribute money for the equipment of triremes, dramatic choruses, and religious deputations to various shrines. These were the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λῃτουργίαι</foreign>in contrast to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπηρεσίαι</foreign>mentioned in <bibl n="Dem. Ex. 52">Dem. Ex. 52</bibl>.</note> In these duties I shall be found, not only to have been the first to do my own part, but also to have urged the rest to do theirs. Reviewing these services one by one, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, consider how undeserved is the calamity that has now befallen me.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">Since my present troubles are so abundant I am at a loss to know what I shall bemoan first. Will it be my advanced age,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">His age was sixty. Cicero was only a year older when he wrote his essay <bibl n="Cic. Sen.">Cic. <title>On Old Age.</title></bibl></note> at which, for the first time and contrary to my deserts, I am compelled to experience the hazards of a perilous exile? Or will it be the disgrace of having been convicted and ruined without any investigation or proof of guilt? Or will it be in disappointment of my hopes in place of which I have fallen heir to evils that rightfully belonged to others, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>since neither because of my previous political record was I deserving punishment nor had the charges been proved upon which I was being tried. For I shall never be shown to have been one of the friends of Harpalus,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Harpalus was an absconding treasurer of Alexander who sought refuge in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. Part of his illicit funds disappeared from the Acropolis, where they had been sequestered by the Athenians. Demosthenes was accused and convicted of accepting twenty talents. Few historians believe that he was guilty; some suggest that he may have spent part of the money in the cause of liberty.</note> and among the decrees that were passed concerning him only those proposed by me have afforded the State a clean record. From all these facts it is clear that I was caught in an unfortunate conjuncture, not taken in wrongdoing, and that through coming first on the list into court I unjustly fell foul of the public rage against all those involved in those charges.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Because, which of the just pleas that have saved those subsequently tried did not I myself advance? Or what proof did the Council allege against me? Or what proof could it now allege? There is none; for it is impossible to make facts out of what never happened. I refrain, however, from enlarging upon these topics, though there is plenty to write, for the consciousness of innocence has afforded me proof through experience that, while a feeble help in time of trouble, it is the most excruciating of all means of enhancing one’s suffering.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>So, since, quite rightly, you have become reconciled with all others involved in these charges, be reconciled with me also, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for I have done no wrong against you, as I call upon the gods and heroes<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Demigods or semi-divine ancestors of noble families.</note> to bear testimony. My witness is the whole extent of time that has gone by, which has a juster claim upon your credence than the unsupported charge which has now been brought against me; nor shall I be found to be the worst or the least trustworthy of those who have been falsely accused.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p rend="indent">And surely my departure from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> would not afford you just grounds for resentment against me, for it was not because I had renounced allegiance to you nor because I was looking to another quarter for comfort<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The suggestion is that another man might have offered his services to the Macedonians.</note> that I changed my residence to another country, but because, in the first place, I was pained at contemplating the disgrace of imprisonment, and in the second, on account of my age I was in no condition to endure the bodily discomforts. Besides, I did not think that you, either, were averse to my getting beyond the reach of revilement which, without benefiting you, was breaking me down.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>For, as indications that it was on you my thoughts were centered and on no others, you may note many items of evidence; for instance, I did not go to a city in which I was likely to play an outstanding role myself,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">He hints that he might have gone to some other city friendly to the Macedonians, where a welcome would have awaited him if he had renounced his allegiance to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> but to one where I knew our ancestors had gone when the Persian danger overtook them,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The Athenians abandoned the city before the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in <date when="-0480">480</date> B.C.</note> and where I knew too there existed abundant goodwill toward yourselves.</p></div>

In this city, when certain persons, thinking to make themselves agreeable to me, ventured to censure you for your arbitrary action in my regard, I preserved all reticence, as was my duty, which I believe was the chief reason for their being moved to admiration of me and honoring me in the name of the city.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p rend="indent">Observing, however, that though the goodwill of the men there was strong, yet the power of the city was insufficient for the present need, I changed my residence and now have my quarters in the sanctuary of Poseidon in Calauria,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Calauria is situated south of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> in the Sardonic Gulf.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p rend="indent">In order, therefore, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that I may no longer be held in the grip of these present miseries, enact for me those measures you have already voted for the benefit of certain others, so that neither shall anything unworthy of you become my lot nor I be compelled to become the suppliant of rival powers; for that would not be an honorable thing for you either.

<head>Concerning the Sons of Lycurgus</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="center"><note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Eight citations of this letter by Hermogenes, Aristeides and others may be found in Walz’s <title>Rhetores Graeci</title>. It is also cited by Harpocration and by Antiatticista in Bekker’s <title>Anecdota</title>. It seems to have been known also to Photius and to the author of the <title>Etymologicum Magnum</title>. References to all of these will be found in the footnotes. In spite of these evidences of authenticity the majority of editors reject the letter. By Blass it is defended and of all six letters it certainly has the strongest case.</note> Demosthenes to the Council and the Assembly sends greeting.</p> <p rend="indent">I sent you the previous letter about matters that concern myself, stating what steps I thought in justice ought to be taken by you; in regard to these you will take favorable action when it seems good to you. The message I now address to you I should not like you to overlook or to hear it in a spirit of contentiousness, but with due regard to the justness of it. For it happens that, although sojourning in an out-of-the-way place, I hear many people censuring you for your treatment of the sons of Lycurgus.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Now I should have sent you the letter merely out of regard for those services that Lycurgus performed during his lifetime, for which you would all, like myself, be in justice grateful if you would but do your duty. For Lycurgus, having taken a post in the financial department of the government<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Lycurgus managed the finances of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> efficiently for twelve years (338-326), for one legal term of four years as treasurer and for two terms through others. During this period the income of the State was doubled and a large building program was carried through. In politics Lycurgus was associated with Demosthenes. Though he ranked as one of the ten Attic orators, his style was rather forceful than polished. One speech, <title>Against Leocrates</title>, is extant and his Life in Ps. <bibl n="Plut. Dec. Orat. 1">Plut. Vit. 10 Orat.</bibl>, whose author seems to have made extensive use of the decree in his honor, <title>I.G.</title> 2. 456. Cf. also <title>I.G.</title> 2. 333, <date from="1493" to="1496">1493-1496</date>.</note> at the outset of his career and not being at all accustomed to draft documents pertaining to the general affairs of the Greeks and their relations with their allies, only when the majority of those who pretended to be the friends of democracy were deserting you, began to devote himself to the principles of the popular party, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>not because from this quarter opportunity was offering to secure gifts and emoluments, since all such prizes were coming from the opposite party,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The Macedonians.</note> nor yet because he observed this policy to be the safer one, since there were many manifest dangers which a man was bound to incur who chose to speak on behalf of the people, but because he was truly democratic and by nature an honest man.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And yet before his very eyes he observed those who might have assisted the cause of the people growing weak with the drift of events and their adversaries gaining strength in every way. None the less for all that, this brave man continued to adhere to such measures as he thought were in the people’s interest and subsequently he continued to perform his duty unfalteringly in word and deed, as was clear to see. As a consequence his surrender was straightway demanded,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The surrender of Lycurgus, along with that of Demosthenes and others, was demanded after the fall of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> in <date when="-0335">335</date> B.C. Alexander was persuaded by the Athenian orator Demades to relent.</note> as all men are aware.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">Now I would have written this letter, as I said at the outset, for the sake of Lycurgus alone, but over and above that, believing it to be to your interest to know the criticisms being circulated among those who go abroad, I became all the more eager to dispatch the letter. I beg of those who for private reasons were at odds with Lycurgus to endure to hear what in truth and justice may be said in his behalf; for be well assured, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that, as things now are, the city is acquiring an evil reputation because of the way his sons have been treated.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>For none of the Greeks is ignorant that during the lifetime of Lycurgus you honored him extraordinarily,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">In addition to offices of trust Lycurgus several times received the honor of a crown and of statues at the public expense.</note> and, though many charges were brought against him by those who were envious of him, you never found a single charge to be true, and you so trusted him and believed him to be truly democratic beyond all others that you decided many points of justice on the ground that <q type="emph">Lycurgus said so,</q> and that sufficed for you. This would certainly not have happened unless it had seemed to you that he was so honest.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Today, therefore, all men, upon hearing that his sons are in prison, while pitying the dead man, sympathize with the children as innocent sufferers, and reproach you bitterly after a manner that I, for one, should not dare to write down for, touching the reports which make me vexed at those who utter them, and which I contradict as best I can, trying to come to your defence, I have written these only to the extent of making it clear to you that many people are blaming you, since I believe it to be to your interest to know this, though to quote their words verbatim I judge would be offensive.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Apart from mere abuse, however, I shall reveal all that certain people say and which I believe it to your advantage to have heard. For, after all, no one has supposed that you laboured under a misunderstanding and deception concerning the truth so far as Lycurgus himself is concerned, for the length of time during which, where subject to scrutiny,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">There was a board of thirty men at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> who acted as accountants and auditors. Ten of the thirty were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔθυνοι</foreign>; any official who handled public money could be charges before them with bribery or misappropriation of funds. All accounts were subject to their inspection. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 48.3">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 48.3-4</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 53.2">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 53.2</bibl>.</note> he never was found guilty of any wrong toward you in either thought or deed and the fact that no human being could ever have accused you of indifference to any other action of his naturally eliminate the pretext of ignorance.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">So the explanation is left—what all would declare the conduct of vile men—that so long as you have use for each official you seem to be concerned for him but after that feel no obligation; for where else is one to expect that the gratitude due from you to the dead will be shown, when he observes the opposite treatment meted out to his children and his good name, which are the sole concerns of all men when facing death, that it may continue to be well with them? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>And assuredly, to appear to do these things for the sake of money is also unworthy of truly honorable men, for it would be clearly inconsistent either with your magnanimity or with your general principles of conduct. For instance, if it were necessary to ransom the children from foreign captors by giving this sum out of the revenues, I believe you would all be eager to do it; but when I observe you reluctant to remit a fine which was imposed because of mere talk and envy, I do not know what judgement I can pass unless it be that you have launched upon a course of utterly bitter and truculent hostility toward the members of the popular party. If this be the case, you have made up your minds to deliberate neither righteously nor in the public interest.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent">I am amazed if none of you thinks that it is a disgraceful thing for the people of Athens, who are supposed to be superior to all men in understanding and culture and have also maintained here for the unfortunate a common refuge in all ages, to show themselves less considerate than Philip, who, although naturally subject to no correction, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>nursed as he was, in licence, still thought that at the moment of his greatest good fortune<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>, <date when="-0338">338</date> B.C.; the Greeks magnified its importance.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>You, however, though Athenians and partners in a culture which is thought capable of making even stupid people tolerable, in the first place—and of all your actions this is the most heartless—hold the sons in chains as a penalty for offences which certain parties allege against the father<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The precise accusation is not known; it seems to have been concerned with the administration of the treasury.</note>; in the next place, you claim this action to be equality before the law, just as if you were inspecting equality in the field of weights or measures and not deliberating about men’s ethical and political principles.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>In testing these, if the actions of Lycurgus seem honest and public-spirited and inspired by loyalty, then it is justice that his sons should not only meet with no harm at your hands, but with all the benefits imaginable; yet if his actions seem quite the opposite, he ought to have been punished while he lived, and these children should not thus incur your anger on the ground of charges someone prefers against the father, because for all men death is an end of responsibility for all their offences.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Consequently, if you are going to be so minded that those who have conceived some grudge against those who espouse the cause of the people will not be reconciled even with dead men, but will persist in maintaining their enmity against the children, and if the people, in whose cause every friend of democracy labours, shall remember their gratitude only so long as they can use a man in the flesh and thereafter shall feel no concern, then nothing will be more miserable than to choose the post of champion of the people.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p rend="indent">If Moerocles<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Moerocles was archon in <date when="-0324">324</date> B.C. His surrender had been demanded by Alexander in <date when="-0335">335</date> B.C., which indicates his importance.</note> replies that this view is too subtle for his understanding, and that, to prevent them from running away, he put them in chains upon his own responsibility, demand of him why in the world he did not see the justice of this proceeding when Taureas, Pataecus, Aristogeiton and himself,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Nothing specific is known about these imprisonments, but it need not be assumed that all four men were under sentence at a single time.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>If, on the other hand, he shall say that he was not then archon, he had no right to speak, at any rate according to the laws.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">If Moerocles ordered the two sons of Lycurgus to be imprisoned but left Taureas, Pataecus and Aristogeiton at liberty, the charge against him is criminal partiality. If he denies that he was archon at the time and so lacked the authority to order these men to be detained in prison, then the minor charge still stands against him of addressing the Assembly while technically a prisoner himself. As a prisoner he would be subject to partial <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</foreign> or diminution of his rights as a citizen.</note> Accordingly, how can it be equal justice when some men are in office who have no right even to speak and others are in fetters whose father was useful to you in numerous ways? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>I certainly cannot figure it out unless you mean to demonstrate this fact officially—that blackguardism, shamelessness and deliberate villainy are strong in the State and enjoy a better prospect of coming off safely, and that, if such men happen to get into a tight place, a way out is discovered, but to elect to live in honesty of principle, sobriety of life and devotion to the people will be hazardous and, if some false step is made, the consequences will be inescapable.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p rend="indent">Furthermore, the fact that it is unjust to entertain concerning Lycurgus the opposite opinion to the one you held while he lived, and that justice demands that you should have more regard for the dead than for the living, and all such considerations I shall pass over, for I assume them to be universally agreed upon. Of the children of others, however, whom you recompensed for their fathers’ good services I would gladly see you reminded; for instance, the descendants of Aristeides, Thrasybulus, Archinus and many others.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">At times the Athenian Assembly bestowed extravagant gifts upon the children of famous men, as may be learned from <bibl n="Plut.

Archinus was one of the restorers of democracy in <date when="-0403">403</date> B.C., but the greater share of the credit went to Thrasybulus.</note> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>Not by way of censure have I cited these examples, for so far am I from censuring as to declare it my belief that such repayments are in the highest degree in the interest of the State, because you challenge all men by such conduct to be champions of the people, when they observe that, even if during their own lives envy shall stand in the way of their receiving merited honors, yet their children, at any rate, will be sure to receive their due rewards at your hands.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p rend="indent">Is it not absurd, therefore, or rather even disgraceful, toward certain other men to keep alive the goodwill justly due them, in spite of the fact that the times of their usefulness are long past and after this interval you learn of their good deeds by hearsay and have not assumed them from things of which you have been eye-witnesses, but toward Lycurgus, whose political career and death are so recent, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>you do not show yourselves so ready to display even pity and kindness as you were at all other times toward men whom you never knew and by whom you used to be wronged, and, worse still, your vengeance is visited upon his children, whom even an enemy, if only he were fair-minded and capable of reason, would pity?  </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p rend="indent">Moreover, I am amazed if any one of you is ignorant of this fact also, that it is not to the interest of our political life, either, for this to become public knowledge, that those who have established friendship in a certain other quarter<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">That is, with the Macedonian court.</note> are sure to prosper in all things and fare better and, if some mishap occurs, the ways of escape are easier, but those who have attached themselves to the cause of the people will not only fare worse in other respects but for them alone of all men calamities will remain irremediable. Yet it is easy to demonstrate the truth of this, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>for who of you does not know the incident of Laches<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Laches is known from an inscription as a syndic of the deme Aexonê (I.G. 2. <date when="1197">1197</date>, p. 560, 13 f.).</note> the son of Melanopus, whose lot it was to be convicted in a court of law precisely as the sons of Lycurgus in the present instance, but his entire fine was remitted when Alexander requested it by letter? And again, that it happened to Mnesibulus<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Mnesibulus is not otherwise known.</note> of Acharnae to be similarly convicted, the court condemning him just as it has the sons of Lycurgus, and to have the fine remitted, and rightly too, for the man was deserving? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>And none of those who are now making such an outcry declared that by these actions the laws were being nullified. Quite rightly so, for they were not being nullified, if it be true that all our laws are enacted for the sake of just men and for the preservation of honest men, and that it is expedient neither to render the calamities of the unfortunate perpetual nor for men to show themselves void of gratitude.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>And furthermore, if it is expedient for these principles to hold true, as we would declare, not only were you not nullifying the laws where you released those men, but you were preserving the lifework of those men who enacted the laws, first, by releasing Laches in compliance with the request of Alexander and, secondly, by restoring Mnesibulus to his rights because of the sobriety of his life.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p rend="indent">Beware of demonstrating, therefore, that to acquire some outside friendship<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">Of the Macedonians.</note> is more profitable than to give one’s self in trust to the people and that it is better to remain in the ranks of the unknown than to become known as a man who in public life consults the interests of you, the majority. For although it is impossible for one who recommends policies and administers the commonwealth to please everyone, yet if a man, actuated by loyalty, has at heart the same interests as the people, he has a right to security of person. Otherwise you will teach everyone to serve the interests of others rather than those of the people and to shun recognition for doing any of those things that are to your advantage.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>In short, it is a reproach common to all citizens, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and a misfortune of the State as a whole, that envy should be thought to be stronger among you than the grace of gratitude for services performed, and the more so because envy is a disease but the Graces<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">A verbal play on <foreign xml:lang="grc">χάριτες</foreign>, <q type="gloss">feelings of gratitude</q> or <q type="gloss">Graces.</q></note> have been assigned a place among the gods.</p></div>

For who does not know that this man, when, under the obligation to serve you, he was entering upon public life, was being hounded as a slave and was under indictment as an alien usurping the rights of a citizen and came near being sold by these men whose servant he now is and for whom he used to write the speeches against me, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>but since he is himself now practising what he then accused others of doing, is in such easy circumstances as to keep two mistresses, who have escorted him—and kind it is of them—on the way to death by consumption,<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθόη</foreign> was peculiar enough to prick the interest of Harpocration, who cites this passage.</note> and to be able to discharge a debt of five talents more easily than he could have produced five drachmas previously, and besides all this, with the permission of you, the people, not only participates in the government, which is a common reproach to all, but also performs on your behalf the ancestral<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The point is that Pytheas himself lacked ancestors of note.</note> sacrifices at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>?  </p></div>

<head>On the Slanderous Attacks of Theramenes</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="center"><note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">This letter is not cited in ancient authorities and there is less likelihood of its being genuine</note> Demosthenes to the Council and the Assembly sends greeting.</p> <p rend="indent">I hear that Theramenes<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">There is no known connection between this obscure man and the Theramenes who played a conspicuous role during the latter years of the Peloponnesian War.</note> has uttered various slanderous statements concerning me and in particular that he taunts me with being ill-fated.<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">The implication is that Demosthenes was an unlucky person who brought bad luck to the State. Deinarchus in his speech <title>Against Demosthenes</title> 31-33 (<bibl n="Din. 1.31">Din. 1.31-33</bibl>) asserts that he also involved his collaborators in his own ill luck. It may he noted that <bibl n="Cic. pro Man. 10.28">Cicero, <title>For the Manilian Law</title> 10. 28</bibl>, places <foreign xml:lang="lat">felicitas</foreign> on a par with <foreign xml:lang="lat">scientia rei militaris</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="lat">virtus</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="lat">auctoritas</foreign>.</note> Now I am not astonished that this man should be ignorant that abusive language, which demonstrates no vice on the part of the one against whom it is spoken, carries no weight with fair-minded people. For if one who in his way of life is insolent, by birth is not a citizen, and was reared from childhood in a brothel, had even a faint perception in such matters, it would be more unintelligible than complete ignorance.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>As for this man, If some day I return and am restored to my rights, I shall plan to have a talk with him about the drunken abuse he directs at me and at you, and I believe that, even if he is devoid of shame, I shall render him more self-restrained. To you, however, in the interest of the common good, I wish to make known by letter what statements I have to make about these matters. Listen to my words with all attention, for I think they are not only worth hearing but also worth remembering.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">As for me, I assume that your city is the most fortunate in the world and the dearest to the gods, and I know that Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> and Dione<note anchored="true" resp="DeWitt">At the shrine of Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> it was Dione, and not Hera, who was considered his consort. Elsewhere Dione was identified with Aphrodite or Venus.</note> and the Pythian Apollo are always saying this in their oracles and confirming with the seal of their approval the opinion that good fortune has her abode in the city among you. Moreover, all that the gods reveal about coming events it is obvious that they prophesy; but the epithets based upon past events they apply to experiences of the past.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Now, what I have done as a public man among you belongs in the class of events already past, on the ground of which the gods have bestowed upon you the epithet fortunate. How, then, is it fair for those who followed advice to be denominated fortunate but the adviser to receive the opposite epithet? Unless someone should give this explanation, that for the common good fortune, of which I was the counsellor, it is the gods who vouch, and to think they lie would be sacrilege, but that the personal slander, which Theramenes has directed against me, it is an insolent, shameless and not even intelligent person who has uttered.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">Now, it is not only by the words of the oracles coming from the gods that you will find the fortune you have enjoyed to be good but also by viewing it in the light of the facts themselves, if you will scan them rightly. For if as human beings you are willing to regard our affairs, you will find that our city, as a result of the policy I advised, has been very fortunate, but if you shall demand to receive those blessings which are reserved for the gods alone, you aim at the impossible.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>What, then, is reserved for gods but for men is impossible? To be in absolute control of all the blessings there are, both to possess them themselves and to bestow them upon others, and never in all eternity either to suffer anything bad or to look forward to suffering it. Next, these propositions having been laid down, as is proper, scan your blessings in comparison with those of the rest of mankind.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>No one, for instance, is so foolish as to assert that what has befallen either the Spartans, whom I never advised, or the Persians, whom I never even visited, is preferable to your present lot. I pass over the Cappadocians, the Syrians, and the beings who inhabit the land of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> toward the ends of the earth, all of whom have had the misfortune to suffer many terrible and grievous afflictions.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>O yes, by Zeus, all will agree that you are faring better than these, but worse, they declare, than the Thessalians, Argives and Arcadians, or certain others, who had the luck to be in alliance with Philip. But you have come off far better than these, not only because you have not been reduced to slavery—and yet what blessing equals that?—but also because, while all those are thought to be responsible for the evils that have befallen the Greeks through Philip and their enslavement, in consequence of which they are hated with good reason, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>you are seen to have struggled in defence of the Greeks at the expense of your lives, your property, your city, your territory and all you possess, in return for which you are entitled to glory and undying gratitude from all lovers of justice. Therefore, as a result of the counsels I gave, it has been the city’s good fortune to fare best of all the states that resisted Philip and there is the added gain of standing in higher repute than those who co-operated with him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">On these grounds, therefore, the gods, while giving favorable oracles to you, are turning back the unjust slander upon the head of him who utters it, and any man would recognize the facts if he chose to examine the practices in which he spends his life. For instance, he does by preference the very things that one might invoke upon him as a curse.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>I would not have written this had I not wished to stir in you the recollection of the vices that attach to him. For many terrible and shameful things, which a man would shrink from telling and would guard against mentioning in writing and, as I think, would be disgusted to hear of, each one of you, reminded by these words, knows to attach to this man, so that nothing indecent has been uttered by me and this man upon sight is a reminder to all of his own vices.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>It would also be to me one of the most grievous disappointments if, after having started out to feel friendly toward you, I should be compelled to take the opposite decision instead, and if I assume that I have been slighted and deceived, even if I shall deny it, believe me, it will be so.</p></div>
