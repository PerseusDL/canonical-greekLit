<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Let me begin, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, by beseeching all the Powers of Heaven that on this trial I may find in Athenian hearts such benevolence towards me as I have ever cherished for the city and the people of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. My next prayer is for you, and for your conscience and honor. May the gods so inspire you that the temper with which you listen to my words shall be guided, not by my adversary— </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>that would be monstrous indeed!— but by the laws and by the judicial oath, by whose terms among other obligations you are sworn to give to both sides an impartial hearing. The purpose of that oath is, not only that you shall discard all prejudice, not only that you shall show equal favor, but also that you shall permit every litigant to dispose and arrange his topics of defence according to his own discretion and judgement.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Among many advantages which Aeschines holds over me in this contention, there are two, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, of great moment. In the first place, I have a larger stake on the issue; for the loss of your favor is far more serious to me than the loss of your verdict to him. For me, indeed—but let me say nothing inauspicious at the outset of my speech: I will only say that he accuses me at an advantage. Secondly, there is the natural disposition of mankind to listen readily to obloquy and invective, and to resent self-laudation.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>To him the agreeable duty has been assigned; the part that is almost always offensive remains for me. If as a safeguard against such offence, I avoid the relation of my own achievements, I shall seem to be unable to refute the charges alleged against me, or to establish my claim to any public distinction. Yet, if I address myself to what I have done, and to the part I have taken in politics, I shall often be obliged to speak about myself. Well, I will endeavor to do so with all possible modesty; and let the man who has initiated this controversy bear the blame of the egoism which the conditions force upon me.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">You must all be agreed, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that in these proceedings I am concerned equally with <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, and that they require from me no less serious consideration. Any loss, especially if inflicted by private animosity, is hard to bear; but to lose your goodwill and kindness is the most painful of all losses, as to gain them is the best of all acquisitions.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Such being the issues at stake, I implore you all alike to listen to my defence against the accusations laid, in a spirit of justice. So the laws enjoin—the laws which Solon, who first framed them, a good democrat and friend of the people, thought it right to validate not only by their enactment but by the oath of the jury; </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>not distrusting you, if I understand him aright, but perceiving that no defendant can defeat the charges and calumnies which the prosecutor prefers with the advantage of prior speech, unless every juryman receives with goodwill the pleas of the second speaker, as an obligation of piety to the gods by whom he has sworn, and forms no final conclusion upon the whole case until he has given a fair and impartial hearing to both sides.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">It appears that I have today to render account of the whole of my private life as well as of my public transactions. I must therefore renew my appeal to the gods; and in your presence I now beseech them, first that I may find in your hearts such benevolence towards me as I have ever cherished for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and secondly that they will guide you to such a judgement upon this indictment as shall redound to the good repute of the jury, and to the good conscience of every several juryman.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">If then Aeschines had confined his charges to the matters alleged in the prosecution, I should have immediately addressed my defence to the resolution of the Council; but as he has wastefully devoted the greater part of his speech to irrelevant topics, mostly false accusations, I conceive it to be both fair and necessary, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to say a few words first on those matters, lest any of you, misled by extraneous arguments, should listen with estrangement to my justification in respect of the indictment.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p rend="indent">To his abusive aspersion of my private life, I have, you will observe, an honest and straightforward reply. I have never lived anywhere but in your midst. If then you know my character to be such as he alleges, do not tolerate my voice, even if all my public conduct has been beyond praise, but rise and condemn me incontinently. But if, in your judgement and to your knowledge, I am a better man and better born than Aeschines, if you know me and my family to be, not to put it offensively, as good as the average of respectable people, then refuse credence to all his assertions, for clearly they are all fictitious, and treat me today with the same goodwill which throughout my life you have shown to me in many earlier contentions.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>Malicious as you are, Aeschines, you were strangely innocent when you imagined that I should turn aside from the discussion of public transactions to reply to your calumnies. I shall do nothing of the sort: I am not so infatuated. Your false and invidious charges against my political life I will examine; but later, if the jury wish to hear me, I will return to your outrageous ribaldry.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent">The crimes he has laid to my charge are many, and to some of them the law has assigned severe and even capital punishment. But the purpose of this prosecution goes further: it includes private malice and violence, railing and vituperation, and the like; and yet for none of these accusations, if made good, is there any power at all in the state to inflict an adequate penalty, or anything like it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>It is not right to debar a man from access to the Assembly and a fair hearing, still less to do so by way of spite and jealousy. No, by heavens, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is neither just, nor constitutional, nor honest! If he ever saw me committing crimes against the commonwealth, especially such frightful crimes as he described just now so dramatically, his duty was to avail himself of the legal penalties as soon as they were committed, impeaching me, and so putting me on my trial before the people, if my sins deserved impeachment, or indicting me for breach of the constitution, if I had proposed illegal measures. For, of course, if he prosecutes <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> now on my account, it is impossible that he would not have indicted me, with a certain hope of conviction!</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>Yet if he detected me in any of the acts which he has recounted to my prejudice, or in any other iniquity, there are statutes dealing with those offences, punishments, legal processes, trials involving severe penalties and heavy fines; and any of these proceedings he might have taken. Had he so acted, had he in that way employed the methods applicable to my case, his denunciations would have been consistent with his conduct; </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>but in fact he has deserted the path of right and justice, he has flinched from the proof of recent guilt, and then, after a long interval, he makes a hotchpotch of imputation and banter and scurrility, and stands on a false pretence, denouncing me, but indicting <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>. He sets in the forefront of the controversy his private quarrel with me, in which he has never confronted me fairly; yet he is avowedly seeking to disfranchise somebody else.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>There are many other arguments, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to be pleaded on <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>’s behalf, but this surely is eminently reasonable, that the honest course was to fight out our own quarrels by ourselves, not to turn aside from our antagonism and try to find some one else to injure. That is carrying iniquity too far!</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p rend="indent">It is a fair inference that all his accusations are equally dishonest and untruthful. I wish, however, to examine them one by one, and especially the falsehoods he told to my discredit about the peace and the embassy, attributing to me what was really done by himself with the aid of Philocrates. It is necessary, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and not improper, to remind you of the position of affairs in those days, so that you may consider each transaction with due regard to its occasion.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p rend="indent">When the Phocian war began—not by my fault, for I was still outside politics—you were at first disposed to hope that the Phocians would escape ruin, although you knew that they were in the wrong, and to exult over any misfortune that might befall the Thebans, with whom you were justly and reasonably indignant because of the immoderate use they had made of the advantage they gained at Leuctra. The <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> was divided. The enemies of the Lacedaemonians were not strong enough to destroy them; and the aristocrats whom the Lacedaemonians had put into power had lost control of the several states. In those states and everywhere else there was indiscriminate strife and confusion.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>Philip, observing these conditions, which were apparent enough, spent money freely in bribing traitorous persons in all the cities, and tried to promote embroilment and disorder. He based his designs on the errors and follies of others, and the growth of his power was perilous to us all. When it was evident that the Thebans, now fallen from arrogance to disaster, and much distressed by the prolongation of the war, would be compelled to seek the protection of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, Philip, to forestall such an appeal and coalition, offered peace to you and succor to them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>Now what contributed to his success, when he found you ready to fall into his trap almost eagerly, was the baseness, or, if you prefer the term, the stupidity, or both, of the other Greek states. You were fighting a long and incessant war for purposes in which, as the event has proved, they were all concerned, and yet they helped you neither with money, nor with men, nor with anything else; and so, in your just and natural indignation, you readily accepted Philip’s suggestion. The peace conceded to him at that time was due to the causes I have named, and not, as Aeschines maliciously insists, to me; and the misdeeds and the corruption of Aeschines and his party during that peace will be found, on any honest inquiry, to be the true cause of our present troubles.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>These distinctions and explanations I offer merely for the sake of accuracy; for if you should suppose that there was any guilt, or ever so much guilt, in that peace-making business, the suspicion does not concern me. The first man to raise the question of peace in a speech was Aristodemus, the actor, and the man who took up the cue, moved the resolution, and, with Aeschines, became Philip’s hired agent, was Philocrates of Hagnus—your confederate, Aeschines, not mine, though you lie till you are black in the face. Their supporters in the debate were Eubulus and Cephisophon—on whose motives I have at present nothing to say. I never spoke in favor of the peace.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>And yet, though the facts are such and demonstrated to be such, he has the amazing impudence to tell you that I am to blame for the terms of peace, and that I stopped the city from arranging the terms in conjunction with a congress of the Greek states. Why, you, you—but I can find no epithet bad enough for you—was there any single occasion when you, having observed me in your presence trying to rob the state of a negotiation and of an alliance which you have just described as of the greatest importance, either made any protest, or rose to give the people any information whatsoever about the proceeding which you now denounce?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>Yet if I had really intrigued with Philip to stop a Panhellenic coalition, it was your business not to hold your peace, but to cry aloud, to protest, to inform the people. You did nothing of the sort. No one ever heard that fine voice of yours. Of course not; for at that time there was no embassy visiting any of the Greek states, but all the states had long ago been sounded, and there is not an honest word in his whole story.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>Moreover, his falsehoods are the worst of slanders upon <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. If at one and the same time you were inviting the Greeks to make war and sending envoys to Philip to negotiate peace, you were playing a part worthy of Eurybatus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Eurybatus, of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, a proverbial knave, gave to Cyrus military money entrusted to him by Croesus.</note> the impostor, not of a great city or of honest men. But it is false; it is false! For what purpose could you have summoned them at that crisis? For peace? They were all enjoying peace. For war? You were already discussing terms of peace. Therefore it is clear that I did not promote, and was in no way responsible for, the original peace, and that all his other calumnies are equally false.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p rend="indent">Now observe what policy we severally adopted after the conclusion of peace. You will thereby ascertain who acted throughout as Philip’s agent, and who served your interests and sought the good of the city. I proposed in the Council that the ambassadors should sail without delay to any place where they might learn that Philip was to be found, and there receive from him the oath of ratification; but in spite of my resolution they refused to go. What was the reason of that refusal?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>I will tell you. It suited Philip’s purposes that the interval should be as long, and ours that it should be as short as possible; for you had suspended all your preparations for war, not merely from the day of ratification, but from that on which you first began to expect peace. That was just what Philip was contriving all the time, expecting with good reason that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he might seize before the ratification, as no one would break the peace to recover them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>Foreseeing that result, and appreciating its importance, I moved that the embassy should repair to the place where they would find Philip and swear him in without delay, in order that the oath might be taken while your allies the Thracians were still holding the places about which Aeschines was so sarcastic—Serrium, Myrtenum, and Ergisce—and that Philip might not get control of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> by seizing the positions of advantage and so providing himself amply with men and money for the furtherance of his ulterior designs.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>That decree Aeschines neither cites nor reads; though he mentions to my discredit that I suggested in Council that the Macedonian ambassadors should be introduced. What ought I to have done? Objected to the introduction of men who had come expressly to confer with you? Ordered the lessee not to give them reserved seats in the theatre? But they could have sat in the threepenny seats, if I had not moved my resolution. Or was it my business to take care of the public pence, and put up the state for sale, like Aeschines and his friends? Surely not. Please take and read this decree, which the prosecutor omitted, though he knows it well.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p rend="center"><label>(The Decree of Demosthenes is read)</label></p> <delSpan spanTo="#a001"/><p rend="indent"><quote type="decree">In the archonship of Mnesiphilus, on the thirtieth day of Hecatombaeon, the tribe Pandionis then holding the presidency, Demosthenes, son of Demosthenes, of Paeania, proposed that, whereas Philip has sent ambassadors and has agreed to articles of peace, it be resolved by the Council and People of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, with a view to the ratification of the peace as accepted by vote of the first Assembly, to choose at once five ambassadors from all the citizens; and that those so elected repair without delay wheresoever they ascertain Philip to be, and take and administer to him the oaths with all dispatch according to the articles agreed on between him and the People of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, including the allies on either side. The ambassadors chosen were Eubulus of Anaphlystus, Aeschines of Cothocidae, Cephisophon of Rhamnus, Democrates of <placeName key="tgn,7012055">Phlya</placeName>, Cleon of Cothocidae.</quote></p><anchor xml:id="a001"/></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p rend="indent">My object in moving this decree was to serve <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, not Philip. Nevertheless these excellent envoys took so little heed of it that they loitered in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> for three whole months, until Philip returned from <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, having subdued the whole country; though they might have reached the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> in ten or perhaps in three or four days, and rescued the outposts by receiving the oaths of ratification before Philip captured them. He dared not have touched them in our presence, or we should not have accepted his oath, and so he would have missed his peace, instead of gaining both his objects—peace and the strongholds as well.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p rend="indent">Such then is the history of the first act of knavery on Philip’s part, and venality on the part of these dishonest men at the time of the embassy. For that act I avow that I was then, am still, and ever shall be their enemy and their adversary. I will next exhibit an act of still greater turpitude which comes next in order of time.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>When Philip had sworn to the peace, having first secured <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> because of their disobedience to my decree, he bribed them to postpone our departure from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> until he had made ready for his expedition against the Phocians. He was afraid that, if we reported that he intended and was already preparing to march, you would turn out and sail round with your fleet to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, and block the passage, as you did before; and his object was that you should not receive our report until he had reached this side of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> and you were powerless.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>He was so nervous, and so much worried by the fear that, in spite of his Thracian success, his enterprise would slip from his fingers if you should intervene before the Phocians perished, that he made a new bargain with this vile creature—all by himself this time, no t in common with his colleagues— to make that speech and to render that report to you, by which all was lost.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>I earnestly beg you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to bear in mind throughout this trial that, if Aeschines had not gone outside the articles of indictment in his denunciation of me, I too would not have digressed; but as he has resorted to every sort of imputation and slander, I am compelled to reply briefly to all his charges in turn.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>What then were the speeches he made at that crisis—the speeches that brought everything to ruin? He told you that you need not be excited because Philip had passed <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>; that, if only you kept quiet, you would get all you wanted, and would within two or three days learn that Philip was now the friend of those to whom he came as enemy, and the enemy of those to whom he came as friend. The bonds of amity, he declared, with his most impressive eloquence, are fortified not by words but by community of interest; and it was an interest common to Philip, to the Phocians, and to all of you alike, to be quit of the unfeeling and offensive behavior of the Thebans.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>Some of you were delighted to hear these remarks, for at that time we all disliked the Thebans. What was the result—not the distant, but the immediate result? That the Phocians perished and their cities were demolished; that you took his advice and kept quiet—and before long were carrying in your chattels from the country; and that Aeschines pocketed his fee. A further result was that <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> got all the ill will of the Thebans and Thessalians, and Philip all their gratitude for these transactions.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>To prove the truth of these statements, please read the decree of Callisthenes and Philip’s letter, which will make every point clear.</p> <p rend="center"><label>(The Decree of Callisthenes is read)</label></p> <delSpan spanTo="#a002"/><p rend="indent"><quote type="decree">In the archonship of Mnesiphilus, at an extraordinary assembly convened by the Generals and the Presidents, with the approval of the Council, on the twenty-first day of Maemacterion, Callisthenes, son of Eteonicus of Phalerum, proposed that no Athenian be allowed upon any pretext whatsoever to pass the night in the country, but only in the City and Peiraeus, except those stationed in the garrison; that the latter keep each the post assigned to him, leaving it neither by day nor by night.</quote></p></div>

We have put garrisons in all the fortified places that surrendered voluntarily; those that did not obey we have stormed and razed to the ground, selling the inhabitants into slavery. Hearing that you are actually preparing an expedition to help them, I have written to you to save you further trouble in this matter. Your general policy strikes me as unreasonable, to agree to peace, and yet take the field against me, and that although the Phocians were not included in the ill terms upon which we agreed.

By such delusions he carried them off their feet so completely that they had no foresight nor any inkling whatever of the sequel, but allowed him to take control of the whole business; and that is the real cause of their present distresses.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p>And the man who was hand-in-glove with Philip, and helped him to win that blind confidence, who brought lying reports to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and deluded his fellow-citizens, was this same Aeschines who to day bewails the sorrows of the Thebans and recites their pitiful story, being himself guilty of those sorrows, guilty of the distresses of the Phocians, guilty of all the sufferings of every nation in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p rend="indent">However, I have digressed to topics that will perhaps be more appropriately discussed later on. I return to my proof that the misdeeds of these men are the real cause of the present situation.</p> <p rend="indent">When you had been deluded by Philip through the agency of the men who took his pay when on embassy and brought back fictitious reports, and when the unhappy Phocians were likewise deluded, and all their cities destroyed, what happened?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>Those vile Thessalians and those ill-conditioned Thebans regarded Philip as their friend, their benefactor, and their deliverer. He was all in all to them; they would not listen to the voice of any one who spoke ill of him. You Athenians, though suspicious and dissatisfied, observed the terms of peace, for you could do nothing. The rest of the Greeks, though similarly overreached and disappointed, observed the peace; and yet in a sense the war against them had already begun; </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>for when Philip was moving hither and thither, subduing Illyrians and Triballians, and some Greeks as well, when he was gradually getting control of large military resources, and when certain Greek citizens, including Aeschines, were availing themselves of the liberty of the peace to visit <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and take bribes, all these movements were really acts of war upon the states against which Philip was making his preparations. That they failed to perceive it is another story, and does not concern me.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>My forebodings and expostulations were unceasing; I uttered them in the Assembly and in every city to which I was sent. But all the cities were demoralized. The active politicians were venal and corrupted by the hope of money: the unofficial classes and the people in general were either blind to the future or ensnared by the listlessness and indolence of their daily life; in all the malady had gone so far that they expected the danger to descend anywhere but upon themselves, and even hoped to derive their security at will from the perils of others.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p>In the result, of course, the excessive and inopportune apathy of the common people has been punished by the loss of their independence, while their leaders, who fancied they were selling everything except themselves, discover too late that their own liberty was the first thing they sold. Instead of the name of trusty friend, in which they rejoiced when they were taking their bribes, they are dubbed toad-eaters and scoundrels, and other suitable epithets. What did they expect?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>Men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is not because he wants to do a traitor a good turn that a man spends his money; nor, when he has once got what he paid for, has he any further use for the traitor’s counsels. Otherwise treason would be the most profitable of all trades. But it is not so. How could it be? Far from it! As soon as the man who grasps at power has achieved his purpose, he is the master of those who sold him his mastery; and then—yes, then!—knowing their baseness, he loathes them, mistrusts them, and reviles them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>Look at these instances, because, though the right time for action is past, for wise men it is always the right time to understand history. Lasthenes was hailed as friend—until he betrayed <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>; Timolaus, until he brought <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to ruin; Eudicus and Simus of Larissa, until they put <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> under Philip’s heel. Since then the whole world has become crowded with men exiled, insulted, punished in every conceivable way. What of Aristratus at <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>? or Perilaus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Perilaus: so MSS. here, and, with variations, in 295; according to Greek lexicographers the name was Perillus.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>? Are they not outcasts?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p>From these examples it may be clearly discerned that the man who is most vigilant in defence of his country and most vigorous in his opposition to treason—he is the man, Aeschines, who provides you traitors and mercenaries with something that you can betray for a bribe; and, if you are still secure and still drawing your pay, you owe this to the great majority of these citizens, and to those who thwarted your purposes—for your own efforts would long ago have brought you to destruction.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p rend="indent">I could say much more about the history of that time, but I suppose that what has been said is more than enough. My antagonist is to blame, for he has so bespattered me with the sour dregs of his own knavery and his own crimes, that I was obliged to clear myself in the eyes of men too young to remember those transactions. But it has perhaps been wearisome to you, who, before I said a word, knew all about his venality.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>However, he calls it friendship and amity; and only just now he spoke of <q type="spoken">the man who taunts me with the friendship of Alexander.</q> I taunt you with the friendship of Alexander! Where did you get it? How did you earn it? I am not out of my mind, and I would never call you the friend either of Philip or Alexander, unless we are to call a harvester or other hired laborer the friend of the man who pays him for his job.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>But it is not so. How could it be? Far from it!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p>Now take first the clause which recites that in word and deed I have constantly done my best for the common weal, and that I am ever zealous to do all the good in my power, and which commends me on those grounds.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>As for his proposing that a crown should be given to me, and the decoration proclaimed in the Theatre, without adding the words, <q type="written">provided he shall first have rendered his accounts,</q> I conceive that that also is related to my public acts, whether I am, or am not, worthy of the crown and of the proclamation before the people; but I have, however, also to cite the statutes that authorize such a proposal. In this way, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I am resolved to offer an honest and straightforward defence. I will proceed at once to the history of my own actions; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p>and let no one imagine that I am straying from the indictment if I touch upon Hellenic policy and Hellenic questions; for by attacking as mendacious that clause of the decree which alleges that in word and deed I have acted for the common good, it is Aeschines who has made a discussion of the whole of my public life necessary and pertinent to the indictment. Further, out of many spheres of public activity I chose Hellenic affairs as my province, and therefore I am justified in taking Hellenic policy as the basis of my demonstration.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p rend="indent">Well, I pass by those successes which Philip achieved and maintained before I became a politician and a public speaker, as I do not think that they concern me. I will, however, remind you of enterprises of his which were thwarted after the day on which I entered public life. Of these I will render an account, premising only that Philip started with this enormous advantage.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p>In all the Greek states—not in some but in every one of them—it chanced that there had sprung up the most abundant crop of traitorous, venal, and profligate politicians ever known within the memory of mankind. These persons Philip adopted as his satellites and accomplices. The disposition of Greeks towards one another was already vicious and quarrelsome and he made it worse. Some he cajoled; some he bribed; some he corrupted in every possible way. He split them into many factions, although all had one common interest—to thwart his aggrandizement.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p>Now seeing that all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was in such a plight, and still unconscious of a gathering and ever-growing evil, what was the right policy for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to adopt, and the right action for her to take? That is the question, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which you ought to consider, and that is the issue on which I ought to be called to account; for I was the man who took up a firm position in that department of your public affairs.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p>Was it the duty of our city, Aeschines, to abase her pride, to lower her dignity, to rank herself with Thessalians and Dolopians, to help Philip to establish his supremacy over <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, to annihilate the glories and the prerogatives of our forefathers? Or, if she rejected that truly shameful policy, was she to stand by and permit aggressions which she must have long foreseen, and knew would succeed if none should intervene?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p>I would now like to ask the man who censures our past conduct most severely, what party he would have wished our city to join. The party that shares the guilt of all the disasters and dishonors that have befallen <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,—the party, as one may say, of the Thessalians and their associates? Or that which permitted those disasters in the hope of selfish gain, the party in which we may include the Arcadians, the Messenians, and the Argives?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>Why, the fate of many, indeed of all, of those nations is worse than ours. For if, after his victory, Philip had at once taken himself off, and relapsed into inactivity, harassing neither his own allies nor any other Greeks, there might have been some reason for finding fault with the opponents of his enterprises; but seeing that, wherever he could, he destroyed the prestige, the authority, the independence, and even the constitution of every city alike, who can deny that you chose the most honor able of all policies when you followed my advice?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p rend="indent">To resume my argument: I ask you, Aeschines, what was the duty of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> when she perceived that Philip’s purpose was to establish a despotic empire over all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>? What language, what counsels, were incumbent upon an adviser of the people at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, of all places in the world, when I was conscious that, from the dawn of her history to the day when I first ascended the tribune, our country had ever striven for primacy, and honor, and renown, and that to serve an honor able ambition and the common welfare of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> she had expended her treasure and the lives of her sons far more generously than any other Hellenic state fighting only for itself; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>and knowing as I did that our antagonist Philip himself, contending for empire and supremacy, had endured the loss of his eye, the fracture of his collar-bone, the mutilation of his hand and his leg, and was ready to sacrifice to the fortune of war any and every part of his body, if only the life of the shattered remnant should be a life of honor and renown?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p>Surely no man will dare to call it becoming that in a man reared at <placeName key="perseus,Pella">Pella</placeName>, then a mean and insignificant city, such lofty ambition should be innate as to covet the dominion of all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and admit that aspiration to his soul, while you, natives of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, observing day by day, in every speech you hear and ill every spectacle you behold, memorials of the high prowess of your forefathers, should sink to such cowardice as by a spontaneous, voluntary act to surrender your liberty to a Philip.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p>No one will make that assertion. The only remaining, and the necessary, policy was to resist with justice all his unjust designs. That policy was adopted by you from the start in a spirit that well became you, and forwarded by me in all my proposals, according to the opportunities of my public life. I admit the charge. Tell me; what ought I to have done? I put the question to you, Aeschines, dismissing for the moment everything else—<placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Pydna">Pydna</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>, Halonnesus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p>Serrium, Doriscus, the sack of Peparethus, and all other injuries of our city—I ignore them utterly. Yet you told us that I entangled the citizens in a quarrel by my talk about those places, though every resolution that concerned them was moved by Eubulus, or Aristophon, or Diopeithes, not by me; only you allege so glibly whatever suits your purpose!</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p>Even now I will not discuss them. But here was a man annexing <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> and making it a basis of operations against <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, attacking <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, occupying Oreus, demolishing Porthmus, establishing the tyranny of Philistides at Oreus and of Cleitarchus at <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName>, subjugating the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, besieging <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, destroying some of the Greek cities, reinstating exiled traitors in others: by these acts was he, or was he not, committing injustice, breaking treaty, and violating the terms of peace? Was it, or was it not, right that some man of Grecian race should stand forward to stop those aggressions?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p>If it was not right, if <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was to present the spectacle, as the phrase goes, of the looting of <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">looting of <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, by pirates; the proverbial example of cowardly non-resistance.</note> while Athenians still lived and breathed, then I am a busybody, because I spoke of those matters, and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, too, is a busybody because she listened to me; and let all her misdeeds and blunders be charged to my account!

The difference between railing and accusation I take to be this: accusation implies crimes punishable by law; railing, such abuse as quarrelsome people vent upon one another according to their disposition. These law courts, if I am not mistaken, were built by our ancestors, not that we should convene you here to listen to us taunting one another with the secret scandal of private life, but that we should here bring home to the guilty offences against the public weal.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p>Aeschines knows that as well as I do; but he has a keener taste for scurrility than for accusation.

You pose as my enemy; are you sure you are not the enemy of the people?</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p rend="indent">A righteous and conscientious verdict is now sufficiently indicated; but I have still, as it seems—not because I have any taste for railing, but because of his calumnies—to state the bare necessary facts about Aeschines, in return for a great many lies. I must let you know who this man, who starts on vituperation so glibly—who ridicules certain words of mine though he has himself said things that every decent man would shrink from uttering—really is, and what is his parentage.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p>Why, if my calumniator had been Aeacus, or Rhadamanthus, or Minos, instead of a mere scandalmonger, a market-place loafer, a poor devil of a clerk, he could hardly have used such language, or equipped himself with such offensive expressions.

Why it was only the day before yesterday when he became simultaneously an Athenian and an orator, and, by the addition of two syllables, transformed his father from Tromes to Atrometus, and bestowed upon his mother the high sounding name of Glaucothea, although she was universally known as the Banshee, a nickname she owed to the pleasing diversity of her acts and experiences—it can have no other origin.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p>In fact, the Council of the Areopagus knew well that Aeschines had been to blame throughout this affair, and therefore when, after choosing him by vote to speak in support of your claims to the Temple at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, by a misapprehension such as has often been fatal to your public interests, you invited the cooperation of that Council and gave them full authority, they promptly rejected him as a traitor, and gave the brief to Hypereides.

Philip had sent to us <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> of <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> in company with an embassy representing all his allies, hoping to bring dishonor upon <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and convict her of injustice. <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> was mightily confident, denouncing you with a full spate of eloquence, but I did not shrink from the encounter. I stood up and contradicted him, refusing to surrender the just claims of the commonwealth, and proving that Philip was in the wrong so conclusively that his own allies rose and admitted I was right; but Aeschines took Philip’s side throughout, and bore witness, even false witness, against his own country.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p rend="indent">Nor did that satisfy him. At a later date he was caught again in the company of the spy Anaxinus at the house of Thraso.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p rend="indent">I omit thousands of stories that I could tell you about him. The fact is, I could cite many clear instances of his conduct at that time, helping the enemy and maligning me; only it is not your way to score up such offences for accurate remembrance and due resentment. You have a vicious habit of allowing too much indulgence to anyone who chooses by spiteful calumnies to trip up the heels of a man who gives you good advice. You give away a sound policy in exchange for the entertainment you derive from invective; and so it is easier and safer for a public man to serve your enemies and pocket their pay than to choose and maintain a patriotic attitude.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p rend="indent">Though it was a scandalous shame enough, God knows, openly to take Philip’s side against his own country even before the war, make him a present, if you choose, make him a present of that.

No profitable proposition, great or small, stands to the credit of Aeschines. If he claims any, let him cite it now, while my hour-glass<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">hour-glass, the clepsydra or water-clock, used to measure the time allowed by the court to each speaker.</note> runs. But there is none. Now one of two things: either he made no alternative proposal because he could find no fault with my policy, or he did not disclose his amendments because his object was the advantage of the enemy.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p rend="indent">Did he then refrain from speech as well as from moving resolutions, when there was any mischief to be done? Why, no one else could get in a word! Apparently the city could stand, and he could do without detection, almost anything; but there was one performance of his that really gave the finishing touch to his earlier efforts. On that he has lavished all his wealth of words, citing in full the decrees against the Amphissians of <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName>, in the hope of distorting the truth. But he can never disguise it. No, Aeschines, you will never wash out that stain; you cannot talk long enough for that!</p></div>

But if with malice or in the spirit of personal rivalry I lay against him any false charge, I pray that they may dispossess me of everything that is good.</p></div>

That mistake was made before, when by his false reports he contrived the destruction of the unhappy Phocians.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>The war at <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName>, that is, the war that brought Philip to Elatea, and caused the election, as general of the Amphictyons, of a man who turned all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> upside down, was due to the machinations of this man. In his own single person he was the author of all our worst evils. I protested instantly; I raised my voice in Assembly; I cried aloud, <q type="spoken">You are bringing war into <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, Aeschines, an Amphictyonic war;</q> but a compact body of men, sitting there under his direction, would not let me speak, and the rest were merely astonished and imagined that I was laying an idle charge in private spite.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p>Men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you were not allowed to hear me then; but now you must and shall hear what was the real nature of that business, what was the purpose of the conspiracy, and how it was accomplished.

                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p rend="indent">For Philip there could be no end or quittance of hostilities with <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> unless he should make the Thebans and Thessalians her enemies. Now, aIthough your commanders were conducting the war against him without ability and without success, he was vastly distressed both by the campaign and by the privateers; for he could neither export the products of his own country, nor import what he needed for himself.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p>At that time he had no supremacy at sea, nor could he reach <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> by land unless the Thessalians followed his banner and the Thebans gave him free passage. In spite of his successes against the commanders you sent out, such as they were—I have nothing to say of their failure—he found himself in trouble by reason of conditions of locality and of the comparative resources of the two combatants.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p>Now, if he should invite the Thebans or the Thessalians to take up his private quarrel and march against you, he could expect no attention; but if he should espouse their joint grievances and be chosen as their leader, he might hope to succeed by a mixture of deception and persuasion. Very well; he sets to work—and observe how cleverly he managed it—to throw the Pylaean Congress into confusion and to implicate the Amphictyonic Council in warfare, feeling certain that they would immediately beg him to deal with the situation.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p>If, however, the question should be introduced by any of the commissioners of religion sent by him or by any allies of his, the Thebans and Thessalians, as he expected, would be suspicious and all on their guard; but, if the operator should be an Athenian, representing his opponents, he conceived that he would easily escape detection. And such was the actual result.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p rend="indent">How did he manage it? By hiring Aeschines. Nobody, of course, had any inkling; nobody was watching— according to your usual custom! Aeschines was nominated for the deputation to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>; three or four hands were held up, and he was declared elected. He repaired to the Council, invested with all the prestige of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and at once, putting aside and disregarding everything else, addressed himself to the business for which he had taken pay. He concocted a plausible speech about the legendary origin of the consecration of the Cirrhaean territory, and by this narration induced the commissioners, men unversed in oratory and unsuspicious of consequences, </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p>to vote for a tour of survey of the land which the Amphissians said they were cultivating because it belonged to them, while Aeschines accused them of intruding on consecrated ground. It is not true that these Locrians w ere meditating any suit against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, or any other action such as he now falsely alleges in excuse. You will find a proof of his falsehood in this argument:—Of course it was not competent for the Locrians to take proceedings against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> without serving a summons. Well, who served it? From what office was it issued? Name anyone who knows; point him out. You cannot; it was a false and idle pretext of yours.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p rend="indent">With Aeschines as their trusty guide, the Amphictyons began their tour of the territory; but the Locrians fell upon them, were within an ace of spearing the whole crowd, and did actually seize and carry off the sacred persons of several commissioners. Complaints were promptly laid, and so war against the Amphissians was provoked. At the outset Cottyphus was commander of an army composed of Amphictyons; but some divisions never joined, and those who joined did nothing at all. The persons engaged in the plot, mostly scoundrels of old standing from <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and other states, prepared to put the war into Philip’s hands at the next congress.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p>They found a plausible pretext: you must either, they said, pay contributions to a war-chest, maintain mercenary forces, and levy a fine on all recusants, or else elect Philip as commander-in-chief: and so, to cut a long story short, elected he was on this plea. He lost no time, collected his army, pretended to march to <placeName key="tgn,6001466">Cirrha</placeName>, and then bade the Cirrhaeans and the Locrians alike good-bye and good luck, and seized Elatea.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p>When the Thebans saw the trick, they promptly changed their minds and joined our side; otherwise the whole business would have descended upon <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> like a torrent from the hills.

                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p rend="indent">Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the presiding councillors<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">presiding councillors: the fifty representatives on the Council of that one of the ten tribes within whose term of administrative duty the meeting fell.</note> the news that Elatea had been taken.

Unfolded is a conjectural reading derived from the scholium cited; but no satisfactory explanation is forthcoming of the reading of all MSS., set fire to the hurdles.</note> while others summoned the commanders and ordered the attendance of the trumpeter. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the morrow the presidents summoned the Council to the Council House, and the citizens flocked to the place of assembly. Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p>The Council arrived, the presiding Councillors formally reported the intelligence they had received, and the courier was introduced. As soon as he had told his tale, the marshal put the question, Who wishes to speak? No one came forward. The marshal repeated his question again and again, but still no one rose to speak, although all the commanders were there, and all the orators, and although the country with her civic voice was calling for the man who should speak for her salvation; for we may justly regard the voice, which the crier raises as the laws direct, as the civic voice of our country.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p>Now had it been the duty of every man who desired the salvation of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to come forward, all of you, aye, every Athenian citizen, would have risen in your places and made your way to the tribune, for that salvation, I am well assured, was the desire of every heart. If that duty had fallen upon the wealthy, the Three Hundred would have risen; if upon those who were alike wealthy and patriotic, the men who thereafter gave those generous donations which signalized at once their wealth and their patriotism.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p>But, it seems, the call of the crisis on that momentous day was not only for the wealthy patriot but for the man who from first to last had closely watched the sequence of events, and had rightly fathomed the purposes and the desires of Philip; for anyone who had not grasped those purposes, or had not studied them long beforehand, however patriotic and however wealthy he might be, was not the man to appreciate the needs of the hour, or to find any counsel to offer to the people.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p>On that day, then, the call was manifestly for me. I came forward and addressed you; and I will now ask your careful attention to the speech I then made, for two reasons: first, that you may understand that I, alone among your orators and politicians, did not desert the post of patriotism in the hour of peril, but approved myself as one who in the midst of panic could, both in speech and in suggestion, do what duty bade on your behalf; and secondly, because at the cost of a few minutes of study you may gain experience which will stand you in good stead for your policy in times to come.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p rend="indent">What I said was this. <q type="spoken">In my judgement the present position of affairs is misunderstood by those who are so much alarmed by the apprehension that all <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> is at the disposal of Philip. If that were true, I am quite certain that we should have heard of him not at Elatea but on our own frontiers. But I know with certainty that he has come to complete his preparations at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. Let me tell you how he is situated.</q></p> </div>

If, however, you will listen to my advice, and apply your minds to consideration, but not to captious criticism, of what I lay before you, I believe that you will find my proposals acceptable, and that I shall disperse the perils that overhang our city.</q></p></div>

Do not ask any favor of the Thebans: for that the occasion is not creditable. Pledge yourselves to come to their aid at their call, on the ground that they are in extremities, and that we have a clearer foresight of the future than they. And so, if they accept our overtures and take our advice, we shall have accomplished our desires and have acted on a principle worthy of our traditions; while, if success does not fall to our lot, they will have themselves to blame for their immediate blunder, and we shall have done nothing mean or discreditable.</q></p></div>

Then was the time therefore for an honest man to point, if he could, to a better way; now cavilling comes too late.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p>That is the salient difference between the statesman and the charlatan, who are indeed in all respects unlike one another. The statesman declares his judgement before the event, and accepts responsibility to his followers, to fortune, to the chances of the hour, to every critic of his policy.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p>That then, as I said, was the opportunity for any man who cared for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> or for honest discussion. But I will make a large concession. If even now any man can point to a better way, nay, if any policy whatever, save mine, was even praticable, I plead guilty. If anyone has now discerned any course which might have been taken profitably then, I admit that I ought not to have missed it. But if there is none, if there never was any, if to this very day no one is able to name any, what was a statesman to do? Surely to choose the best policy among those that were visible and feasible.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p>That is what I did, Aeschines, when the marshal put the question, <q type="spoken">Who wishes to speak?</q> He did not ask, <q type="spoken">Who wishes to rake up old grievances?</q> or, <q type="spoken">Who wishes to be answerable for the future?</q> In those days you sat speechless at every assembly; I came forward and spoke. You had nothing to say then; very well,—show us our duty now. Tell me what plan I ought to have discovered. Tell me what favorable opportunity was lost to the state by my default. Tell me of any alliance, or any negotiation, to which I ought by preference to have introduced the people.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p rend="indent">Bygones are bygones, all the world over. No one proposes deliberation about the past; it is the present and the future that call the statesman to his post. And at that time, as we all thought, there were future perils and there were present perils. Look at the policy I chose in the light of those perils; do not carp at results. The issue depends on the will of a higher Power; the mind of the statesman is manifested in his policy.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p>You must not accuse me of crime, because Philip happened to win the battle; for the event was in God’s hands, not mine. Show me that I did not adopt, as far as human calculation could go, all the measures that were practicable, or that I did not carry them out with honesty and diligence, and with an industry that overtaxed my strength; or else show me that the enterprises I initiated were not honor able, worthy of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and inevitable.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p>If the hurricane that burst upon us has been too strong, not for us alone, but for every Hellenic state,—what then?

If we were destined to disaster when we fought with the Thebans at our side, what were we to expect if we had lacked even that alliance, and if they had joined Philip, a union for which he exerted all his powers of appeal? And if, after a battle fought three days’ march from the frontier, such danger and such alarm beset the city, what must we have expected after suffering the same defeat within our own borders? Do you not see that, as it was, one, or two, or three days gave the city time for resistance, concentration, recovery, for much that made for deliverance; as it might have been—but I will not mention an experience that we were spared by divine favor, and by the protection of that very alliance which you denounce.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p rend="indent">Gentlemen of the jury, all this long story is intended for you, and for that circle of hearers outside the barrier. For this contemptible fellow, I have a short, plain, and sufficient answer. Aeschines, if the future was revealed to you and to nobody else, you should have given us the benefit of your predictions when we were deliberating; if you had no foreknowledge, you are open to the charge of ignorance just like the rest of us. Then what better right have you to denounce me than I to denounce you?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p>In respect of the business of which I am speaking— and at present I discuss nothing else—I am a better citizen than you, in so far as I devoted myself to a course of action that was unanimously approved, neither shirking nor even counting any personal danger. You made no more acceptable suggestion, otherwise mine would not have been adopted; and in carrying out mine you were not of the slightest use. You are proved after the event to have behaved throughout like a worthless and most unpatriotic citizen; and now, by a strange coincidence, those thorough-going enemies of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, Aristratus at <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> and Aristolaus at <placeName key="tgn,7011078">Thasos</placeName>, are bringing the friends of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to trial, while at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> itself Aeschines is accusing Demosthenes.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p>And yet he who built his reputation on the accumulated misfortunes of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> deserves rather to perish himself than to prosecute his neighbor; and the man who has found his profit in the same emergencies as his country’s foes can make no claim to patriotism. You stand revealed in your life and conduct, in your public performances and also in your public abstinences. A project approved by the people is going forward. Aeschines is speechless. A regrettable incident is reported. Aeschines is in evidence. He reminds one of an old sprain or fracture: the moment you are out of health it begins to be active.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p rend="indent">As he lays so much stress on results, let me venture on a paradox. If it seems extravagant, I beg that you will not be surprised, but that you will still give friendly consideration to what I am saying. Suppose that the future had been revealed to all of us, that every one had known what would happen, and that you, Aeschines, had predicted and protested, and shouted and stormed—though in fact you never opened your mouth—even then the city could not have departed from that policy, if she had any regard for honor, or for our ancestors, or for the days that are to come.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p>All that can be said now is, that we have failed and that is the common lot of humanity, if God so wills.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p>How could we have returned the gaze of visitors to our city, if the result had been what it is—Philip the chosen lord paramount of all Greece—and if other nations had fought gallantly to avert that calamity without our aid, although never before in the whole course of history had our city preferred inglorious security to the perils of a noble cause?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p>There is no man living, whether Greek or barbarian, who does not know that the Thebans, or the Lacedaemonians, who held supremacy before them,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The Spartan hegemony lasted from 404 to 371, the Theban from 371 to 362.</note> or the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> himself, would cheerfully and gratefully have given <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> liberty to keep what she had and to take what she chose, if only she would do their behest and surrender the primacy of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p>Aeschines, on the other hand, arraigns the whole policy, stirs up your resentment against me as the author of your terrors and your dangers, and, in his eagerness to strip me of the distinction of a moment, would rob you of the enduring praises of posterity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p>But no; you cannot, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you cannot have done wrongly when you accepted the risks of war for the redemption and the liberties of mankind; I swear it by our forefathers who bore the brunt of warfare at Marathon, who stood in array of battle at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, who fought in the sea-fights of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Artemisium">Artemisium</placeName>, and by all the brave men who repose in our public sepulchres, buried there by a country that accounted them all to be alike worthy of the same honor —all, I say, Aeschines, not the successful and the victorious alone.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p>I should have deserved death!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p rend="indent">However, in touching upon the achievements of our ancestors, I have passed by some of my decrees and other measures.

I am a speaker and a statesman, yet it would seem that, in his view, I am to have no credit for the results of the discussion and deliberation, but am solely responsible for all the misadventures of our arms and of our generalship. Can you imagine a cruder or more abominable calumny? Read the dispatch.</p> <p rend="center"><label>(The Ambassadors’ Dispatch is read)</label></p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p rend="indent">When the Thebans held their assembly, they introduced Philip’s ambassadors first, on the ground that they were in the position of allies. They came forward and made their speech, full of eulogy of Philip, and of incrimination of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and recalled everything you had ever done in antagonism to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. The gist of the speech was that they were to show gratitude to Philip for every good turn he had done to them, and to punish you for the injuries they had suffered, in whichever of two ways they chose— either by giving him a free passage, or by joining in the invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. They proved, as they thought, that, if their advice were taken, cattle, slaves, and other loot from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> would come into <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, whereas the result of the proposals they expected from us would be that <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> would be ravaged by the war. They added many other arguments, all tending to the same conclusion.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p>I would give my life to recapitulate the reply that we made: but I am afraid that, as that crisis is long past, and as you may think that all those transactions are now obliterated as by a flood, you would regard any discussion of them as useless and vexatious. I will only ask you to hear how far we prevailed upon them, and what answer they returned. Take and read this document.</p> <p rend="center"><label>(The Reply of the Thebans is read)</label></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p rend="indent">After that, the Thebans invited you to join them. You marched out: you reinforced them. I pass over the incidents of the march: but their reception of you was so friendly that, while their own infantry and cavalry lay outside the walls, they gave you access to their homes, to their citadel, to their wives and children and most precious possessions. On that day the Thebans publicly paid three fine compliments—to your valor, to your righteousness, and to your sobriety. When they decided to fight on your side rather than against you, they adjudged you to be braver men than Philip, and your claim to be more righteous than his; and when they put into your power what they, like all other men, were most anxious to safeguard, namely their wives and their children, they exhibited their confidence in your sobriety.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p>And thereby, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, they showed a just appreciation of your character. After the entry of your soldiers no man ever laid even a groundless complaint against them, so soberly did you conduct yourselves. Fighting shoulder to shoulder with them in the two earliest engagements,—the battle by the river, and the winter battle,—you approved yourselves irreproachable fighters, admirable alike in discipline, in equipment, and in determination. Your conduct elicited the praises of other nations, and was acknowledged by yourselves in services of thanksgiving to the gods.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p>I should like to ask Aeschines a question: when all that was going on, when the whole city was a scene of enthusiasm and rejoicing and thanksgiving, did he take part in the worship and festivity of the populace, or did he sit still at home, grieving and groaning and sulking over public successes? If he was present as one of the throng, surely his behavior is scandalous and even sacrilegious, for after calling the gods to witness that certain measures were very good, he now asks a jury to vote that they were very bad—a jury that has sworn by the gods! If he was not present, he deserves many deaths for shrinking from a sight in which every one else rejoiced. Please read these decrees.</p> <p rend="center"><label>(The Decrees appointing a Public Thanksgivingare read)</label></p> </div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p rend="indent">So we were engaged in thanksgiving, and the Thebans in the deliverance that they owed to us. The situation was reversed, and a nation that, thanks to the intrigues of Aeschines and his party, seemed on the verge of suing for aid, was now giving aid in pursuance of the advice which you accepted from me. But indeed, what sort of language Philip gave vent to at that time, and how seriously he was discomposed, you shall learn from letters sent by him to <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. Please take and read them, that the jury may learn the real effect of my perseverance, of my journeys and hardships, and of that profusion of decrees at which Aeschines was just now scoffing.</p></div>

                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p>As for myself, I was convinced, presumptuously, perhaps, but convinced I was, that there was no one more competent either to make sound proposals, or to carry them into effect, or to conduct an embassy diligently and honestly: and therefore I took my place in every field of action.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p rend="indent">To these straits had my policy, Aeschines, reduced Philip: and such was then the language uttered by a man who had hitherto lifted his voice vauntingly against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. And for that reason I was deservedly decorated by the citizens. You were present, but said nothing in opposition; and Diondas, who arraigned the grant, did not get the fifth part of the votes. Please read the decrees which were then by that acquittal validated, and which Aeschines never even arraigned.</p> <p rend="center"><label>(The Decrees are read)</label></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p rend="indent">These decrees, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, exhibit the same wording and phrasing as those proposed formerly by Aristonicus, and now by <persName><surname>Ctesiphon</surname></persName>. Aeschines did not prosecute them himself, nor did he support the accusation of the man who did arraign them. And yet if there is any truth in his present denunciation, he might then have prosecuted Demomeles, the proposer, and Hypereides, with more reason than <persName><surname>Ctesiphon</surname></persName>, </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p>who can refer to these precedents, to the decision of the courts, to the observation that Aeschines himself did not prosecute persons who made the same proposals, to the statutory prohibition of repeated prosecution in such cases, and so forth; whereas at that time the issue would have been tried on its merits without such presumptions.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p>On the other hand, at that time, I imagine, there was no chance of doing what he does now, when out of a lot of old dates and decrees he selects for slanderous purposes any that nobody knew beforehand or would expect to hear cited today, transposes dates, substitutes fictitious reasons for the true reasons of transactions, and so makes a show of speaking to the point.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p>That trick was not possible then. All speeches must have been made on a basis of truth, within a short time of the facts, when the jury still remembered details and almost knew them by heart. That is why, after shirking inquiry at the time when the events were recent, he has returned to the issue today, expecting, I suppose, that you will conduct a forensic competition rather than an inquiry into political conduct, and that the decision will turn upon diction rather than sound policy.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p rend="indent">Then he resorts to sophistry, and tells you that you must ignore any opinion of himself and me which you brought with you from home; and that, as, when you cast up a man’s accounts, though you anticipate a surplus, you acquiesce in the result if the totals balance, so you must now accept the result of the calculation. Every dishonest contrivance, you will observe, is rotten to the core.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p>By his ingenious apologue he has admitted that we are both here as acknowledged advocates—I of our country, he of Philip; for if such had not been the view you take of us, he would not have been at pains to convert you.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p>I shall prove without difficulty that he has no right to ask you to reverse that opinion—not by using counters, for political measures are not to be added up in that fashion, but by reminding you briefly of the several transactions, and appealing to you who hear me as both the witnesses and the auditors of my account. We owe it to that policy of mine which he denounces that, instead of the Thebans joining Philip in an invasion of our country, as everyone expected, they fought by our side and stopped him; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p>that, instead of the seat of war being in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, it was seven hundred furlongs away on the far side of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>; that, instead of privateers from <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> harrying us, <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> was at peace on the sea-frontier throughout the war; and that, instead of Philip taking <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> and holding the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, the Byzantines fought on our side against him.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p>Do you see any resemblance between this computation of results and your casting up of counters? Are we to cancel the gains to balance the losses,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The metaphors here are taken from calculations on the abacus, where subtraction of counters from one side of the board would serve instead of addition to the other. Instead of showing the gains of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> side by side with her losses, Aeschines would record only the adverse balance.</note> instead of providing that they shall never be forgotten? I need not add that other nations have had experience of that cruelty which is always observable whenever Philip has got people under his heel, whereas you have been lucky enough to enjoy the fruits of that factitious humanity in which he clothed himself with an eye to the future. But I pass that by.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p rend="indent">I will not shrink from observing that any man who wished to bring an orator to the proof honestly, and not merely to slander him, would never have laid such charges as you have alleged, inventing analogies, and mimicking my diction and gestures. The fate of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, forsooth, depended on whether I used this word or that, or moved my hand this way or that way!</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p>No; he would have considered, in the light of actual facts, the means and resources possessed by the city when I entered on administration, and those accumulated by me when at the head of affairs; and also the condition of our adversaries. If I had impaired our resources, he would have proved that the fault lay at my door: if I had greatly increased them, he would have spared his slanders. As you avoided this test, I will apply it; and the jury will see whether I state the case fairly.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p rend="indent">For resources, the city possessed the islanders—but not all, only the weakest, for neither <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, nor <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, nor <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName> was on our side; a subsidy of forty-five talents, all collected in advance; and not a single private or trooper apart from our own army. But what was most alarming to us, and advantageous to the enemy, Aeschines and his party had made all our neighbors, Megarians, Thebans, and Euboeans, more disposed to enmity than to friendship.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p>Such were the means of the city: and I defy anyone to name anything else. Now consider those of our antagonist Philip. In the first place, he was the despotic commander of his adherents: and in war that is the most important of all advantages. Secondly, they had their weapons constantly in their hands. Then he was well provided with money: he did whatever he chose, without giving notice by publishing decrees, or deliberating in public, without fear of prosecution by informers or indictment for illegal measures. He was responsible to nobody: he was the absolute autocrat, commander, and master of everybody and everything.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p>And I, his chosen adversary—it is a fair inquiry—of what was I master? Of nothing at all! Public speaking was my only privilege: and that you permitted to Philip’s hired servants on the same terms as to me. Whenever they had the advantage of me—and for one reason or another that often happened—you laid your plans for the enemy’s benefit, and went your ways.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p>In spite of all these drawbacks, I made alliance for you with Euboeans, Achaeans, Corinthians, Thebans, Megarians, Leucadians, and Corcyraeans: and from those states there was assembled a foreign division of fifteen thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, not counting their citizen-soldiery. I also obtained from them in money the largest subsidy I could.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p>When you talk about fair terms with the Thebans, Aeschines, or with the Byzantines and the Euboeans, and raise at this time of day the question of equal contributions, in the first place, you must be unaware that of that famous fleet of three hundred galleys that fought for <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName><note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">that fought for <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>: at <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, <date when="-0480">480</date> B.C.</note> in former days, our city supplied two hundred; and that she did not show any sign of complaining that she was unfairly treated, or impeaching the statesmen whose advice she took, or airing her dissatisfaction. That would have been discreditable indeed! No, she gave thanks to the gods that, when all the Greeks alike were encompassed by a great peril, she had contributed twice as much as all the rest to the common deliverance.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p>Secondly, when you grumble at me, you are doing an ill turn to your fellow-citizens. Why do you tell them today what they ought to have done then? You were in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and at the Assembly: why did you not offer your suggestions at the time—if indeed they could possibly be offered during an imminent crisis, when we had to accept, not all that we wanted, but all that the conditions allowed? There was a man lying in wait who was bidding against us, and was ready to welcome any allies we drove away, and pay them into the bargain.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p rend="indent">If I am accused today for what was actually done, suppose that, while I was haggling over nice calculations, these cities had marched off and joined Philip—suppose he had become suzerain o f <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>— what do you think these unprincipled men would have done or said then?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p>Would they not have told you that we had made Philip a present of our allies? That they had been driven away when they wanted to join us?

That by means of the Thebans Attica had become the scene of a distressing war with her own neighbors? That the sea had become useless for ships because of privateers with <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> for their base? Would they not have made all those complaints, and plenty more?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p>Oh, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, what a vile monster is the calumniator, gathering malice from everywhere, always backbiting!

What use has all your cleverness ever been to your country?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p>What! talk about bygones today? It is as though a physician visiting his patients should never open his mouth, or tell them how to get rid of their complaint, so long as they are ill; but, as soon as one of them dies, and the obsequies are celebrated, should follow the corpse to the grave, and deliver his prescription at last from the tombstone: <q type="written">If our departed friend had done this or that, he would never have died!</q> You lunatic! what is the use of talking now?</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p rend="indent">You will find that even our defeat, if this reprobate must needs exult over what he ought to have deplored, did not fall upon the city through any fault of mine. Make your reckoning in this way: wherever I was sent as your representative, I came away undefeated by Philip’s ambassador—from <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, from <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName>, from the Illyrians, from the kings of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, from <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, from every other place, and finally from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>; but wherever Philip was beaten in diplomacy, he attacked the place with an army and conquered it.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p>And for those defeats, Aeschines, you call me to account! Are you not ashamed to jeer at a man for cowardice, and then to require that same man to overcome the whole power of Philip single-handed, and to do it by mere words? For what else had I at my disposal? Certainly not the personal courage of each man, not the good fortune of the troops engaged, not that generalship for which you are unreasonable enough to hold me responsible. Make as strict an inquiry as you will into everything for which an orator is responsible; I ask no indulgence.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p>But for what is he responsible? For discerning the trend of events at the outset, for forecasting results, for warning others. That I have always done. Further, he ought to reduce to a minimum those delays and hesitations, those fits of ignorance and quarrelsomeness, which are the natural and inevitable failings of all free states, and on the other hand to promote unanimity and friendliness, and whatever impels a man to do his duty. All that also I have made my business: and herein no man can find any delinquency on my part.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p>Let any man you like be asked by what means Philip achieved most of his successes: the universal reply will be, by his army and by bribing and corrupting politicians. Well, I had no control or authority over your forces, and therefore no question of their performances can touch me. Moreover, in the matter of corruption or purity I have beaten Philip. In bribery, just as the purchaser has vanquished the seller, whenever the bargain is struck, so the man who refuses the price and remains incorruptible has vanquished the purchaser. Therefore, in my person, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> is undefeated.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p rend="indent">These, and such as these, with many others are the grounds furnished by my conduct to justify the proposal of the defendant. I will now mention grounds furnished by all of you. Immediately after the battle, in the very midst of danger and alarm, at a time when it would not have been surprising if most of you had treated me unkindly, the people, with a full knowledge of all my doings, in the first place, adopted by vote my proposals for the safety of the city. All those measures of defence—the disposition of outposts, the entrenchments, the expenditure on the fortifications—were taken on resolutions moved by me. In the second place, they appointed me Food Controller, selecting me from the whole body of citizens.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p>Then the men who made it their business to injure me formed a cabal, and set in motion all the machinery of indictments, audits, impeachments, and the like—not at first by their own agency, but employing persons by whom they imagined they would be screened. You will remember how, during that early period, I was put on my trial every day; and how the recklessness of Sosicles, and the spite of Philocrates, and the frenzy of Diondas and Melantus, and everything else, were turned to account by them for my detriment. Nevertheless, by the favor, first of the gods, and secondly of you and the rest of the Athenians, I came through unscathed. And so I deserved. Yes; that is true, and to the credit of juries that had taken the oath and gave judgement according to their oath.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p>When, on my impeachment, you acquitted me, and did not give the prosecutors the fifth part of your votes, your verdict implied approval of my policy. When I was indicted, I satisfied you that my proposals and my speeches had been constitutional. When you put the seal on my accounts, you further admitted that I had done my business honestly and without corruption. That being so, what description could <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> properly and honestly have applied to my conduct, other than that which he had seen applied by the whole nation and by sworn juries, and confirmed by the truth in the eyes of all men?</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p rend="indent">Ah, says he, but look at that glorious boast of Cephalus—never once indicted! Yes, glorious, and also lucky. But why should a man who has been often indicted but never convicted be the more justly open to reproach? However, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, so far as Aeschines is concerned, I can repeat that glorious boast: for he never indicted me or prosecuted me on indictment; and so, by his own admission, I am no worse a citizen than Cephalus.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p rend="indent">At every point his morose and spiteful temper is conspicuous, and especially in what he said about fortune. As a general remark, I must say that it is a stupid thing for any human being to reproach his brother man on the score of fortune. Seeing that a man who thinks he is doing very well and regards himself as highly fortunate, is never certain that his good fortune will last till the evening, how can it be right to boast about it, or use it to insult other people? But, since Aeschines has treated this topic, like many others, so vaingloriously, I beg you to observe, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that my discourse on fortune will be more veracious, and more suitable to a mere man, than his.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p>I attribute good fortune to our city, and so, I observe, does the oracle of Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>; but the present fortune of all mankind I account grievous and distressing.

That is my view of fortune: a just and correct view, as it seems to me, and, I think, also to you. But he declares that a poor, insignificant thing like my individual fortune has been more powerful than the great and good fortune of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Now how is that possible?</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p rend="indent">If, Aeschines, you are determined at all costs to investigate my fortune, compare it with your own; and, should you find mine to be better than yours, stop your vilification. Begin your inquiry then at the beginning. And I beg earnestly that no one will blame me for want of generosity. No sensible man, in my judgement, ever turns poverty into a reproach, or prides himself on having been nurtured in affluence. But I am compelled by this troublesome man’s scurrility and backbiting to deal with these topics; and I will treat them with as much modesty as the state of the case permits.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="257"><p rend="indent">In my boyhood, Aeschines, I had the advantage of attending respectable schools: and my means were sufficient for one who was not to be driven by poverty into disreputable occupations. When I had come of age, my circumstances were in accordance with my upbringing. I was in a position to provide a chorus, to pay for a war-galley, and to be assessed to property-tax. I renounced no honor able ambition either in public or in private life: and rendered good service both to the commonwealth and to my own friends. When I decided to take part in public affairs, the political services I chose were such that I was repeatedly decorated both by my own country and by many other Grecian cities and even my enemies, such as you, never ventured to say that my choice was other than honor able.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p>Such has been my fortune throughout my career. I could tell you more, but I forbear, fearing to weary you with details in which I take some pride.</p> <p rend="indent">But do you—you who are so proud and so contemptuous of others— compare your fortune with mine. In your childhood you were reared in abject poverty. You helped your father in the drudgery of a grammar-school, grinding the ink, sponging the benches, and sweeping the school-room, holding the position of a menial, not of a free-born boy.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p>On arriving at manhood you assisted your mother in her initiations,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">in her initiations: she was an expert in Bacchic or Sabazian rites imported from <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>.</note> reading the service-book while she performed the ritual, and helping generally with the paraphernalia. At night it was your duty to mix the libations, to clothe the catechumens in fawn-skins, to wash their bodies, to scour them with the loam and the bran, and, when their lustration was duly performed, to set them on their legs, and give out the hymn: <quote type="hymn"><l>Here I leave my sins behind,</l> <l>Here the better way I find;</l></quote> and it was your pride that no one ever emitted that holy ululation so powerfully as yourself. I can well believe it! When you hear the stentorian tones of the orator, can you doubt that the ejaculations of the acolyte were simply magnificent?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p>In day-time you marshalled your gallant throng of bacchanals through the public streets, their heads garlanded with fennel and white poplar; and, as you went, you squeezed the fat-cheeked snakes, or brandished them above your head, now shouting your Euoi Saboi! now footing it to the measure of Hyes Attes! Attes Hyes!—saluted by all the old women with such proud titles as Master of the Ceremonies, Fugleman, Ivy-bearer, Fan-carrier; and at last receiving your recompense of tipsy-cakes, and cracknels, and currant-buns. With such rewards who would not rejoice greatly, and account himself the favorite of fortune?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p>You entered the service of those famous players Simylus and Socrates, better known as the Growlers. You played small parts to their lead, picking up figs and grapes and olives, like an orchard-robbing costermonger, and making a better living out of those missiles than by all the battles that you fought for dear life. For there was no truce or armistice in the warfare between you and your audiences, and your casualties were so heavy, that no wonder you taunt with cowardice those of us who have no experience of such engagements.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="263"><p rend="indent">However, passing by things for which your poverty may be blamed, I will address myself to actual charges against your way of living.

                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="265"><p rend="indent">And now, Aeschines, I beg you to examine in contrast, quietly and without acrimony, the incidents of our respective careers: and then ask the jury, man by man, whether they would choose for themselves your fortune or mine. You were an usher, I a pupil; you were an acolyte, I a candidate; you were clerk-at-the-table, I addressed the House; you were a player, I a spectator; you were cat-called, I hissed; you have ever served our enemies, I have served my country.</p></div>

                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="268"><p rend="indent">Such has been my character in public life. In private life, if any of you are not aware that I have been generous and courteous, and helpful to the distressed, I do not mention it. I will never say a word, or tender any evidence about such matters as the captives I have ransomed, or the dowries I have helped to provide, or any such acts of charity.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="269"><p>It is a matter of principle with me. My view is that the recipient of a benefit ought to remember it all his life, but that the benefactor ought to put it out of his mind at once, if the one is to behave decently, and the other with magnanimity. To remind a man of the good turns you have done to him is very much like a reproach. Nothing shall induce me to do anything of the sort; but whatever be my reputation in that respect, I am content.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="270"><p rend="indent">I have finished with private matters, but I have still some trifling remarks to offer on public affairs. If you, Aeschines, can name any human being, Greek or barbarian, on whom yonder sun shines, who has escaped all injury from the domination, first of Philip, and today of Alexander, so be it: I grant you that my fortune— or my misfortune, if you prefer the word—has been the cause of the whole trouble.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="271"><p>But if many people, who have never set eyes on me or heard the sound of my voice, have been grievously afflicted—I do not mean as individuals, but whole cities and nations—I say it is vastly more honest and candid to attribute these calamities to the common fortune of mankind, or to some distressing and untoward current of events.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="272"><p>Yet you dismiss those causes, and put the blame upon me, who only took part in politics by the side of my fellow-citizens here, although you must be conscious that a part, if not the whole, of your invective is addressed to all of them, and particularly to yourself. If I had held sole and despotic authority when I offered my counsels, it would have been open to you other orators to incriminate me: </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="273"><p>but inasmuch as you were present at every assembly, as the state proposed a discussion of policy in which every one might join, and as my measures were approved at the time by every one, and especially by you,—for it was in no friendly spirit that you allowed me to enjoy all the hopes and enthusiasm and credit that were attached to my policy, but obviously because truth was too strong for you, and because you had nothing better to suggest—it is most iniquitous and outrageous to stigmatize today measures which at the time you were unable to amend.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="274"><p rend="indent">Among other people I find this sort of distinction universally observed.—A man has sinned willfully: he is visited with resentment and punishment. He has erred unintentionally: pardon takes the place of punishment. Suppose that he has committed no sin or error at all, but, having devoted himself to a project approved by all, has, in common with all, failed of success. In that case he does not deserve reproach or obloquy, but condolence.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="275"><p>This distinction will be found not only embodied in our statutes, but laid down by nature herself in her unwritten laws and in the moral sense of the human race. Now Aeschines so far surpasses all mankind in savagery and malignity that he turns even misadventures, which he has himself cited as such, into crimes for which I am to be denounced.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="276"><p rend="indent">To crown all—as though all his own speeches had been made in a disinterested and patriotic spirit—he bids you be on your guard against me, for fear I should mislead and deceive you, calling me an artful speaker, a mountebank, an impostor, and so forth. He seems to think that if a man can only get in the first blow with epithets that are really applicable to himself, they must be true, and the audience will make no reflections on the character of the speaker.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="277"><p>But I am sure you all know him well, and will regard those epithets as more appropriate to him than to me. I am also sure that my artfulness—well, be it so; although I notice that in general an audience controls the ability of a speaker, and that his reputation for wisdom depends upon your acceptance and your discriminating favor. Be that as it may, if I do possess any skill in speaking, you will all find that that skill has always been exercised on public concerns and for your advantage, never on private occasions and to your detriment. On the other hand the ability of Aeschines is applied not only to speaking on behalf of your enemies, but to the detriment of anyone who has annoyed or quarrelled with him. He never uses it honestly or in the interests of the commonweal.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="278"><p>No upright and honor able citizen must ever expect a jury impanelled in the public service to bolster up his own resentment or enmity or other passions, nor will he go to law to gratify them. If possible he will exclude them from his heart: if he cannot escape them, he will at least cherish them calmly and soberly. In what circumstances, then, ought a politician or an orator to be vehement? When all our national interests are imperilled; when the issue lies between the people and their adversaries. Then such is the part of a chivalrous and patriotic citizen.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="279"><p>But for a man who never once sought to bring me to justice for any public, nor, I will add, for any private offence, whether for the city’s sake or for his own, to come into court armed with a denunciation of a crown and of a vote of thanks, and to lavish such a wealth of eloquence on that plea, is a symptom of a peevish, jealous, small-minded, good-for-nothing disposition. And the exhibition of his turpitude is complete when he relinquishes his controversy with me, and directs the whole of his attack upon the defendant.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="280"><p>It really makes me think, Aeschines, that you deliberately went to law, not to get satisfaction for any transgression, but to make a display of your oratory and your vocal powers. But it is not the diction of an orator, Aeschines, or the vigor of his voice that has any value: it is supporting the policy of the people, and having the same friends and the same enemies as your country.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="281"><p>With such a disposition, a man’s speeches will always be patriotic: but the man who pays court to those from whom the state apprehends danger to herself, is not riding at the same anchor as the people, and therefore does not look to the same quarter for his security. I do; mark that! My purposes are my countrymen’s purposes; I have no peculiar or personal end to serve.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="282"><p>Can you say the same? No, indeed! Why, immediately after the battle you went on embassy to visit Philip, the author of all the recent calamities of your country, although hitherto you had notoriously declined that employment. And who is the deceiver of his country? Surely the man who does not say what he thinks. For whom does the marshal read the commination? For him. What graver crime can be charged to an orator than that his thoughts and his words do not tally? In that crime you were detected; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="283"><p>and yet you still raise your voice, and dare to look your fellow citizens in the face! Do you imagine that they do not know who you are? that they are sunk in such slumber and oblivion that they do not remember the harangues you made while the war was still going on, when you protested with oaths and curses that you had no dealings with Philip— that I had laid that charge against you out of private malice, and that it was not true?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="284"><p>But no sooner had the news of the battle reached us than you ignored all your protests, and confessed, or rather claimed, that you were Philip’s friend and Philip’s guest—a euphemism for Philip’s hired servant; for with what show of equality or honesty could Philip possibly be the host or the friend or even the acquaintance of Aeschines, son of Glaucothea the tambourinist ? I cannot see: but the truth is, you took his pay to injure the interests of your countrymen. And yet you, a traitor publicly convicted on information laid by yourself after the fact, vilify and reproach me for misfortunes for which you will find I am less responsible than any other man.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="285"><p rend="indent">Our city owes to me, Aeschines, both the inception and the success of many great and noble enterprises; nor was she unmindful. It is a proof of her gratitude that, when the people wanted one who should speak over the bodies of the slain, shortly after the battle, you were nominated but they did not appoint you, in spite of your beautiful voice, nor Demades, although he had recently arranged the peace, nor Hegemon, nor any of your party: they appointed me. Then you came forward, and Pythocles with you—and, gracious Heavens! how coarsely and impudently you spoke!—making the very same charges that you have repeated today; but, for all your scurrility, they appointed me nevertheless.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="286"><p>You know very well why; but you shall hear the reason again from me. They were conscious both of the patriotism and energy with which I had conducted their business, and also of the dishonesty of you and your friends; for, when the city had made a false step, you had acknowledged relations which you had strenuously denied on oath in the days of prosperity. They conceived that men who found impunity for their ambitions in our national calamities had long been their secret, and were now their declared, enemies.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="287"><p>They thought it becoming that the orator who should speak over the bodies of the slain, and magnify their prowess, should not be one who had visited the homes and shared the loving cup of their adversaries; that the man who in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> had taken part with their murderers in revels and songs of exultation over the calamities of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, should not be chosen for high distinction at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; and that the chosen speaker should not lament their fate with the feigning voice of an actor, but express the mourning of his very soul. Such sympathy they discerned in themselves, and in me; but not in your party; and that is why they appointed me, and did not appoint you.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="288"><p>The sentiments of the people were shared by those fathers and brothers of the dead who were chosen by the people to conduct the obsequies. In obedience to the custom that requires the funeral feast to be held in the home of the nearest relative of the dead, they ordered it to be held at my house; and with good reason. Each hero had some kinsman who by the ties of blood stood nearer to himself, but to the whole company of the fallen no man was nearer of kin than I. When they had met with their untimely fate, he who was most deeply concerned in their safety and their success, claimed the chief share in mourning for them all.</p></div>

He shed no tears; he had no emotion of regret in his heart; he vociferated, he exulted, he strained his throat. He evidently supposed himself to be testifying against me, but he was really offering proof against himself that in all those distressing events he had had no feeling in common with other citizens.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="292"><p>Yet a man who professes such solicitude, as he has professed today, for our laws and constitution, whatever else he lacks, ought at least to possess the quality of sympathizing both with the sorrows and the joys of the common people; and, in choosing his political principles, he ought not to range himself with their enemies.

I do not claim that favor; I cannot claim it without injustice to you: and I am certain that you will not grant it. If Aeschines had acted an honest part, he would never have indulged his spite against me by impairing and defaming the noblest of your national glories.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="295"><p>At a time when Philip’s resources were feeble and very small indeed, when we were constantly warning, exhorting, admonishing them for the best, these men flung away their national prosperity for private and selfish gain; they cajoled and corrupted all the citizens within their grasp, until they had reduced them to slavery. So the Thessalians were treated by Daochus, Cineas, Thrasydaus, the Arcadians by Cercidas, Hieronymus, Eucampidas, the Argives by Myrtis, Teledamus, Mnaseas, the Eleians by Euxitheus, Cleotimus, Aristaechmus, the Messenians by the sons of that god-forsaken Philiades, Neon and Thrasylochus, the Sicyonians by Aristratus and Epichares, the Corinthians by Deinarchus and Demaretus, the Megarians by Ptoeodorus, Helixus, Perilaus, the Thebans by Timolaus, Theogeiton, Anemoetas, the Euboeans by Hipparchus, Cleitarchus, and Sosistratus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="304"><p>If in each of the cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> there had been some one man such as I was in my appointed station in your midst, nay, if <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> had possessed one man and <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> one man holding the same sentiments that I held, no Hellenic people beyond or on this side of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> would have been exposed to their present distresses: </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="305"><p>they would still be dwelling prosperously in their own countries, in freedom and independence, securely and without fear, grateful to you and to all the Athenians for the great and manifold blessings they owed to me. To prove that, as a precaution against envy, I am using words that do less than justice to my deeds, please take these papers, and read the list of expeditions sent in pursuance of my decrees.</p> <p rend="center"><label>(The List of Expeditions in Aid is read)</label></p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="306"><p rend="indent">It was the duty, Aeschines, of an upright and honor able citizen to take these or similar measures. If they had been successful, we should have been, beyond controversy, the greatest of nations and a nation that deserved its greatness: and, though they have failed, there remains the result that our reputation stands high, and that no man can find fault with <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> or her policy, but lays the blame on the fortune that so ordered the issue.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="307"><p>Assuredly it was not the duty of such a citizen to abandon the cause of his country, to take the hire of her adversaries, to wait on the occasions, not of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but of her enemies. It was not his duty to look with an evil eye upon a man who had made it his business to support or propose measures worthy of our traditions, and was resolved to stand by such measures; nor to treasure vindictively the memory of private annoyances. Nor was it his duty to hold his peace dishonestly and deceptively, as you so often do.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="308"><p>There is, indeed, a silence that is honest and beneficial to the city, such as is observed in all simplicity by the majority of you citizens. Not such, but far, far different, is the silence of Aeschines. Withdrawing himself from public life whenever he thinks fit—and that is very frequently—he lies in wait for the time when you will be weary of the incessant speaker, or when some unlucky reverse has befallen you, or any of those vexations that are so frequent in the life of mortal men; and then, seizing the occasion, he breaks silence and the orator reappears like a sudden squall, with his voice in fine training; he strings together the words and the phrases that he has accumulated, emphatically and without a pause; but, alas, they are all useless, they serve no good purpose, they are directed to the injury of this or that citizen, and to the discredit of the whole community.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="309"><p>Yet if all that assiduous practice, Aeschines, had been conducted in a spirit of honesty and of solicitude for your country’s well-being, it should have yielded a rich and noble harvest for the benefit of us all—alliances of states, new revenues, development of commerce, useful legislation, measures of opposition to our avowed enemies.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="310"><p>In days of old all those services afforded the recognized test of statesmanship: and the time through which you have passed supplied to an upright politician many opportunities of showing his worth; but among such men you won no position—you were neither first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, nor anywhere in the race—at least when the power of your country was to be enlarged.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="311"><p>What alliance does <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> owe to your exertions? What auxiliary expedition, what gain of amity or reputation? What embassy or service, by which the credit of the city has been raised? What project in domestic, Hellenic, or foreign policy, of which you took charge, has ever been successful? What war-galleys, or munitions, or docks, or fortifications, or cavalry, do we owe to you? Of what use in the wide world are you? What public-spirited assistance have you ever given to rich or to poor? None whatever.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="312"><p>But come, sir, without any of these things a man may show patriotism and zeal. Where? When? Why, you incorrigible knave, even at the time when every man who ever spoke from the tribune gave freely to the national defence, when at last even Aristonicus gave the money he had collected to redeem his citizenship, you never came forward and put your name down for a farthing. And yet you were certainly not without means, for you had inherited more than five talents from the estate of your father-in-law Philo, and you had a present of two talents, subscribed by the chairmen of the Navy Boards, as a reward for spoiling the Navy Reform Bill.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="313"><p>However, I will pass that by, for fear I should stray from my immediate purpose by telling one story after another. It is clear that you refused to contribute, not because you were poor, but because you were careful not to do anything in opposition to the party you serve in politics. Then on what occasions are you a man of spirit? When are you a shining light? Whenever something is to be said in prejudice of your fellow-citizens; then your voice is magnificent, then your memory is wonderful; then we hear the great tragedian, the Theocrines<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Theocrines, a notorious informer; prosecuted in a speech attributed to Demosthenes.</note> of the legitimate drama.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="314"><p>Then you remind us of the heroes of past generations. Quite right: but it is not fair, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to take advantage of the affection you cherish for the departed, and analyze me, who am still living in your midst, by comparing me with them.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="315"><p rend="indent">Everybody knows that against the living there is always an undercurrent of more or less jealousy, while the dead are no longer disliked even by their enemies. Such is human nature; am I then to be criticized and canvassed by comparison with my predecessors? Heaven forbid! No, Aeschines; that is unfair and unjust: compare me with yourself, or with any living man you choose, whose principles are identical with yours.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="316"><p>Consider this question: is it more decent and patriotic that for the sake of the services of men of old times, enormous as they were, nay, great beyond expression, the services that are now being rendered to the present age should be treated with ingratitude and vituperation, or that every man who achieves anything in a spirit of loyalty should receive some share of the respect and consideration of his fellow-citizens?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="317"><p>If I must deal with that subject, I say that, if my policy and my principles are considered, they will be found to resemble in spirit and purpose those of the venerated names of antiquity. Yours are like those of the men who maligned them: for it is certain that, even in their days, there were men who were always carping at the living and commending the dead—a spiteful vocation, and just like yours. You tell me I am not at all like those great men.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="318"><p>Are you like them, Aeschines? Or your brother? Or any other orator of this generation? In my opinion, none. Then, my honest friend— to call you nothing worse—assay a living man by the standard of living men, men of his own time. That is the test you apply to everything else—to dramatists, to choruses, to athletes.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="319"><p>Philammon did not leave <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> without a crown, because he was not so strong as Glaucus of Carystus, or other bygone champions: he was crowned and proclaimed victor, because he fought better than the men who entered the ring against him. You must compare me with the orators of today; with yourself, for instance, or anyone you like: I exclude none.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="320"><p>When the commonwealth was at liberty to choose the best policy, when there was a competition of patriotism open to all comers, I made better speeches than any other man, and all business was conducted by my resolutions, my statutes, my diplomacy. Not one o f you ever put in an appearance— except when you must needs fall foul of my measures. But when certain deplorable events had taken place, and there was a call, not for counsellors, but for men who would obey orders, who were ready to injure their country for pay, and willing to truckle to strangers, then you and your party were at your post, great men with gorgeous equipages.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">To keep a stud of horses, whether for racing purposes or for use in the cavalry, was at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the favorite method for displaying wealth.</note> I was powerless, I admit; but I was still the better patriot.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="321"><p rend="indent">There are two traits, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that mark the disposition of the well-meaning citizen;—that is a description I may apply to myself without offence. When in power, the constant aim of his policy should be the honor and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he should preserve his loyalty. That virtue depends on his natural disposition: ability and success depend upon other considerations.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="322"><p>Such, you will find, has been my disposition, abidingly and without alloy. Look at the facts. They demanded that I should be given up; they arraigned me before the Amphictyonic Council; they tried me with threats, they tried me with promises; they set these miscreants to worry me like a pack of wolves; but through it all I never renounced my loyalty to you. At the very outset of my career I had chosen once for all the path of political uprightness and integrity, and resolved to support, to magnify, and to associate myself with the honor, the power, and the glory of my native land.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="323"><p>I do not perambulate the marketplace, gaily exulting in the good fortune of the alien, holding out my right hand, and telling the glad tidings to anyone I think likely to send word over yonder. When I hear of my country’s successes, I do not shudder, and sigh, and hang down my head, like those blasphemers, who traduce <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, forgetting that thereby they are traducing themselves; who turn their eyes abroad, and, when the alien has prospered by the distresses of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, applaud his good fortune, and declare that we must try to preserve it for ever.</p></div> 
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="324"><p rend="indent">Never, O ye Powers of Heaven, never vouchsafe to them the fulfillment of that desire. If it be possible, implant even in them a better purpose and a better spirit; but, if their malady is incurable, consign them, and them alone, to utter and untimely destruction by land and sea, and to us who remain grant speedy deliverance from the terrors that hang over our heads, and a salvation that shall never fail.</p> </div>
