<p>There are some who say that the study of philosophy had its beginning among the barbarians.
They urge that the Persians have had their Magi,
the Babylonians or Assyrians their Chaldaeans, and
the Indians their Gymnosophists; and among the
Celts and Gauls there are the people called Druids
or Holy Ones, for which they cite as authorities the
<hi rend='ital'>Magicus</hi> of Aristotle and Sotion in the
twenty-third<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">The alteration of the numeral from 23 to 13 is
supported
by what little we know of Sotion's work. It was from a similar source that Clement of Alexandria must have taken
what we find in
<hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 71 concerning
Chaldaeans, Druids,
Magians, Gymnosophists, and other barbarian philosophers.</note>
book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Succession of Philosophers.</hi> Also they
say that Mochus was a Phoenician, Zamolxis a
Thracian, and Atlas a Libyan.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>If we may believe the Egyptians, Hephaestus was
the son of the Nile, and with him philosophy began,
priests and prophets being its chief exponents.
Hephaestus lived 48,863 years before Alexander
of Macedon, and in the interval there occurred 373
solar and 832 lunar eclipses.</p>
<pb n='5'/>
<p>The date of the Magians, beginning with Zoroaster
the Persian, was 5000 years before the fall of Troy,
as given by Hermodorus the Platonist in his work
on mathematics; but Xanthus the Lydian reckons
6000 years from Zoroaster to the expedition of
Xerxes, and after that event he places a long line
of Magians in succession, bearing the names of
Ostanas, Astrampsychos, Gobryas, and Pazatas,
down to the conquest of Persia by Alexander.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>These authors forget that the achievements which
they attribute to the barbarians belong to the
Greeks, with whom not merely philosophy but the
human race itself began. For instance, Musaeus is
claimed by Athens, Linus by Thebes. It is said
that the former, the son of Eumolpus, was the first
to compose a genealogy of the gods and to construct
a sphere, and that he maintained that all things
proceed from unity and are resolved again into
unity. He died at Phalerum, and this is his
epitaph<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
615.</note>:</p>
<p>Musaeus, to his sire Eumolpus dear,</p>
<p>In Phalerean soil lies buried here;</p>
<p>and the Eumolpidae at Athens get their name from
the father of Musaeus.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Linus again was (so it is said) the son of Hermes
and the Muse Urania. He composed a poem describing the creation of the world, the courses of the
sun and moon, and the growth of animals and
plants. His poem begins with the line:</p>
<p>Time was when all things grew up at once;</p>
<p>and this idea was borrowed by Anaxagoras when he
<pb n='7'/>
declared that all things were originally together
until Mind came and set them in order. Linus died
in Euboea, slain by the arrow of Apollo, and this is
his epitaph<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
616.</note>:</p>
<p>Here Theban Linus, whom Urania bore,</p>
<p>The fair-crowned Muse, sleeps on a foreign shore.</p>
<p>And thus it was from the Greeks that philosophy
took its rise: its very name refuses to be translated
into foreign speech.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>But those who attribute its invention to barbarians
bring forward Orpheus the Thracian, calling him a
philosopher of whose antiquity there can be no
doubt. Now, considering the sort of things he said
about the gods, I hardly know whether he ought to
be called a philosopher; for what are we to make of
one who does not scruple to charge the gods with
all human suffering, and even the foul crimes wrought
by the tongue amongst a few of mankind? The
story goes that he met his death at the hands of
women; but according to the epitaph at Dium in
Macedonia he was slain by a thunderbolt; it runs
as follows<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> ii.
99.</note>:</p>
<p>Here have the Muses laid their minstrel true,</p>
<p>The Thracian Orpheus whom Jove's thunder slew.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>But the advocates of the theory that philosophy
took its rise among the barbarians go on to explain
the different forms it assumed in different countries.
As to the Gymnosophists and Druids we are told
that they uttered their philosophy in riddles, bidding
men to reverence the gods, to abstain from wrongdoing, and to practise courage. That the Gymnosophists
<pb n='9'/>
at all events despise even death itself is
affirmed by Clitarchus in his twelfth book; he also
says that the Chaldaeans apply themselves to
astronomy and forecasting the future; while the
Magi spend their time in the worship of the gods,
in sacrifices and in prayers, implying that none but
themselves have the ear of the gods. They propound their views concerning the being and origin
of the gods, whom they hold to be fire, earth, and
water; they condemn the use of images, and
especially the error of attributing to the divinities
difference of sex.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
    <p rend="merge">They hold discourse of justice, and deem it impious to practise cremation; but
                                they see no impiety in marriage with a mother or daughter, as Sotion
                                relates in his twenty-third book. Further, they practise divination
                                and forecast the future, declaring that the gods appear to them in
                                visible form. Moreover, they say that the air is full of shapes
                                which stream forth like vapour and enter the eyes of keen-sighted
                                seers. They prohibit personal ornament and the wearing of gold.

by Hermippus in his first book about the Magi,

                                    (names). The meaning then would be: <q>What exists now will

                                    something very like the Heraclitean union of opposites:

                                    of prayer, and there is some evidence that Avestan religion
                                    fully recognized the efficacy of prayers and spells. The
                                    testimony of Theopompus, who wrote in the fourth century, to the
                                    Zoroastrian doctrine of immortality is regarded by J. H. Moulton
                                    as specially important: <hi rend="ital">cf. Early
                                        Zoroastrianism</hi>, pp. 177 <hi rend="ital">sq.</hi> and
                                    416.</note> This is again confirmed by Eudemus of Rhodes. But
                                Hecataeus relates that according to them the gods are subject to
                                birth. Clearchus of Soli in his tract <hi rend="ital">On
                                    Education</hi> further makes the Gymnosophists to be descended
                                from the Magi; and some trace the Jews also to the same origin.
                                Furthermore, those who have written about the Magi criticize
                                Herodotus. They urge that Xerxes would never have cast javelins at
                                the sun nor have let down fetters into the sea, since in the creed
                                of the Magi sun and sea are gods. But that statues of the gods
                                should be destroyed by Xerxes was natural enough.</p></div>

<p>The philosophy of the Egyptians is described as

survives death and passes into other bodies; that
rain is caused by change in the atmosphere; of all
other phenomena they give physical explanations,
as related by Hecataeus and Aristagoras. They
also laid down laws on the subject of justice, which
they ascribed to Hermes; and they deified those
animals which are serviceable to man. They also
claimed to have invented geometry, astronomy, and
arithmetic. Thus much concerning the invention

the wise men, and not only for philosophers but for
the poets also. And so Cratinus when praising
Homer and Hesiod in his
<hi rend='ital'>Archilochi</hi> gives them the
title of sophist.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>The men who were commonly regarded as sages
were the following: Thales, Solon, Periander,
Cleobulus, Chilon, Bias, Pittacus. To these are
added Anacharsis the Scythian, Myson of Chen,
Pherecydes of Syros, Epimenides the Cretan; and
by some even Pisistratus the tyrant. So much for
the sages or wise men.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Compare Clem. Alex.
<hi

includes another candidate for admission to the Seven,
Acusilaus of Argos, but makes no mention of Pisistratus.</note></p>
<p>But philosophy, the pursuit of wisdom, has had
a twofold origin; it started with Anaximander on
the one hand, with Pythagoras on the other. The
former was a pupil of Thales, Pythagoras was taught
by Pherecydes. The one school was called Ionian,
because Thales, a Milesian and therefore an Ionian,
instructed Anaximander; the other school was called
Italian from Pythagoras, who worked for the most
part in Italy.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
    <p rend="merge">And the one school, that of Ionia,
terminates with Clitomachus and Chrysippus and
Theophrastus, that of Italy with Epicurus. The
succession passes from Thales through Anaximander,
Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, to Socrates,
who introduced ethics or moral philosophy; from
Socrates to his pupils the Socratics, and especially
to Plato, the founder of the Old Academy; from
Plato, through Speusippus and Xenocrates, the
succession passes to Polemo, Crantor, and Crates,
Arcesilaus, founder of the Middle Academy, Lacydes,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">See iv.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>There is another which ends with Chrysippus,
that is to say by passing from Socrates to Antisthenes,
then to Diogenes the Cynic, Crates of Thebes, Zeno
of Citium, Cleanthes, Chrysippus. And yet again
another ends with Theophrastus; thus from Plato
it passes to Aristotle, and from Aristotle to Theophrastus. 
In this manner the school of Ionia comes
to an end.</p>
<p>In the Italian school the order of succession is as
follows: first Pherecydes, next Pythagoras, next
his son Telauges, then Xenophanes, Parmenides,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">This
succession (Pythagoras, Telauges, Xenophanes,
Parmenides) does not exactly agree with what is said in
the lives of Xenophanes and Parmenides, ix. 18, 21, where
Parmenides, not Xenophanes, is made a pupil of the Pythagoreans. 
The arrangement followed in i. 12-15 treats the
Italian school as a true succession, whereas in Book IX.
many of them are regarded as sporadic thinkers, according
to the view expressed in viii. 91.</note>
Zeno of Elea, Leucippus, Democritus, who had
many pupils, in particular Nausiphanes [and Naucydes], who were teachers of Epicurus.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>Philosophers may be divided into dogmatists and
sceptics: all those who make assertions about
things assuming that they can be known are
dogmatists; while all who suspend their judgement
on the ground that things are unknowable are
sceptics. Again, some philosophers left writings
behind them, while others wrote nothing at all, as
was the case according to some authorities with
Socrates, Stilpo, Philippus, Menedemus, Pyrrho,
Theodorus, Carneades, Bryson; some add Pythagoras and Aristo of Chios, except that they wrote a
few letters. Others wrote no more than one treatise
each, as Melissus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras. Many
works were written by Zeno, more by Xenophanes,
more by Democritus, more by Aristotle, more by
Epicurus, and still more by Chrysippus.</p></div>

with the universe and all that it contains; ethics
that concerned with life and all that has to do with

flourished down to the time of Archelaus; ethics,
as we have said, started with Socrates; while
dialectic goes as far back as Zeno of Elea. In ethics
there have been ten schools: the Academic, the

<p>Some relate that a vessel with its freight was sent
by Periander to Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus,
and that, when it was wrecked in Coan waters, the
tripod was afterwards found by certain fishermen.
However, Phanodicus declares it to have been found
in Athenian waters and thence brought to Athens.
An assembly was held and it was sent to Bias;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<p rend="merge">for
what reason shall be explained in the life of Bias.</p>
<p>There is yet another version, that it was the work
of Hephaestus presented by the god to Pelops on
his marriage. Thence it passed to Menelaus and
was carried off by Paris along with Helen and was
thrown by her into the Coan sea, for she said it
would be a cause of strife. In process of time
certain people of Lebedus, having purchased a catch
of fish thereabouts, obtained possession of the tripod,
and, quarrelling with the fishermen about it, put in
to Cos, and, when they could not settle the dispute,
reported the fact to Miletus, their mother-city.
The Milesians, when their embassies were disregarded, made war upon Cos; many fell on both
sides, and an oracle pronounced that the tripod
<pb n='35'/>
should be given to the wisest; both parties to the
dispute agreed upon Thales. After it had gone the
round of the sages, Thales dedicated it to Apollo
of Didyma. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
    <p rend="merge">The oracle which the Coans received
was on this wise:</p>
<p>Hephaestus cast the tripod in the sea;</p>
<p>Until it quit the city there will be</p>
<p>No end to strife, until it reach the seer</p>
<p>Whose wisdom makes past, present, future clear.</p>
<p>That of the Milesians beginning <q>Who shall possess the tripod?</q> has been quoted above. So
                                much for this version of the story.</p>

<p>This seems the proper place for a general notice of

the Seven. Anaximenes remarks that they all
applied themselves to poetry; Dicaearchus that
they were neither sages nor philosophers, but merely
<pb n='43'/>
shrewd men with a turn for legislation.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">The opinion of
Dicaearchus thus expressed is correct.
With the exception of Thales, no one whose life is contained
in Book I. has any claim to be styled a philosopher. The
tradition of the Seven Wise Men and of their meeting at
some court, whether of a native tyrant like Periander
or of a foreign prince like Croesus, was used by Plato
(<hi rend='ital'>Protag.</hi> 343 A) and, largely through his influence,
grew into
a romantic legend, the result being late biographies, collections of apophthegms, and letters attributed to various
authors,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the apophthegms of Demetrius of
Phalerum.
Diogenes Laertius swallows all this as true; modern criticism
rejects it all as forgery.</note> Archetimus
of Syracuse describes their meeting at the court of
Cypselus, on which occasion he himself happened to
be present; for which Ephorus substitutes a meeting
without Thales at the court of Croesus. Some make
them meet at the Pan-Ionian festival, at Corinth,
and at Delphi. </p></div>

Plato in his

out Periander; Ephorus substitutes Anacharsis

Dicaearchus hands down four names fully recognized:
Thales, Bias, Pittacus and Solon; and appends the
names of six others, from whom he selects three:

His first achievement was the

Release, which he introduced at Athens; its effect
was to ransom persons and property. For men used
to borrow money on personal security, and many
were forced from poverty to become serfs or daylabourers. He then first renounced his claim to a
debt of seven talents due to his father, and encouraged others to follow his example. This law of
his was called
    <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεισάχθεια,</foreign> and the
reason is obvious.</p>

which would take time to enumerate, and inscribed
them on the revolving pillars.</p></div>

laid rival claims to his birthplace Salamis, and after

head; there he had his poem on Salamis read to

                                than others: wiser than those who fail to understand the plot of

                                it, keep silence through fear.</q> And the members of the council, who
                                were of Pisistratus' party, declared that he was mad: which made him
                                say the lines<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 10 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>A little while, and the event will show</p>
<p>To all the world if I be mad or no.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
<p>That he foresaw the tyranny of Pisistratus is proved
by a passage from a poem of his<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 9 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>On splendid lightning thunder follows straight,</p>
<p>Clouds the soft snow and flashing hail-stones bring;</p>
<p>So from proud men comes ruin, and their state</p>
<p>Falls unaware to slavery and a king.</p>
<p>When Pisistratus was already established, Solon, unable to move the people, piled his arms in
                                front of the generals' quarters, and exclaimed, <q>My country, I
                                have served thee with my word and sword!</q> Thereupon he sailed to
                                Egypt and to Cyprus, and thence proceeded to the court of Croesus.
                                There Croesus put the question, <q>Whom do you consider happy?</q>
                                and Solon replied, <q>Tellus of Athens, and Cleobis and Biton,</q>
                                and went on in words too familiar to be quoted here.</p></div>
<pb n='53'/>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
<p>There is a story that Croesus in magnificent array sat himself down on his throne and asked Solon
                                if he had ever seen anything more beautiful. <q>Yes,</q> was the
                                reply, <q>cocks and pheasants and peacocks; for they shine in
                                nature's colours, which are ten thousand times more beautiful.</q>
                                After leaving that place he lived in Cilicia and founded a city
                                which he called Soli after his own name. In it he settled some few
                                Athenians, who in process of time corrupted the purity of Attic and
                                were said to <q>solecize.</q> Note that the people of this town are
                                called Solenses, the people of Soli in Cyprus Solii. When he learnt
                                that Pisistratus was by this time tyrant, he wrote to the Athenians
                                on this wise<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 11 Bergk.</note>:</p></div>

<p>Thus Solon. After he had gone into exile Pisistratus

                                which the Athenians swore to confer upon Codrus and his family,
                                although later they took them away. In everything else I commit no

                                established by you. And they are better governed than they would be
                                under a democracy; for I allow no one to extend his rights, and
                                though I am tyrant I arrogate to myself no undue share of reputation
                                and honour, but merely such stated privileges as belonged to the

                                would perhaps have tolerated me and not gone into exile. Wherefore

                                will suffer no harm from Pisistratus. For neither has any other

<p>So far Pisistratus. To return to Solon: one of his
sayings is that 70 years are the term of man's life.</p>
<p>He seems to have enacted some admirable laws;
for instance, if any man neglects to provide for his
parents, he shall be disfranchised; moreover there
is a similar penalty for the spendthrift who runs
through his patrimony. Again, not to have a settled
<pb n='57'/>
occupation is made a crime for which any one may,
if he pleases, impeach the offender. Lysias, however,
in his speech against Nicias ascribes this law to Draco,
and to Solon another depriving open profligates of
the right to speak in the Assembly. He curtailed
the honours of athletes who took part in the games,
fixing the allowance for an Olympic victor at 500
drachmae, for an Isthmian victor at 100 drachmae,
and proportionately in all other cases. It was in
bad taste, he urged, to increase the rewards of these
victors, and to ignore the exclusive claims of those
who had fallen in battle, whose sons ought, moreover,
to be maintained and educated by the State.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56">
<p>The effect of this was that many strove to acquit
themselves as gallant soldiers in battle, like Polyzelus,
Cynegirus, Callimachus and all who fought at Marathon; or again like Harmodius and Aristogiton, and
Miltiades and thousands more. Athletes, on the
other hand, incur heavy costs while in training, do
harm when successful, and are crowned for a victory
over their country rather than over their rivals, and
when they grow old they, in the words of Euripides,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi

<head>Chapter 3. CHILON (c. 560B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68">
<p>Chilon, son of Damagetas, was a Lacedaemonian. He wrote a poem in elegiac metre some 200 lines in
                                length; and he declared that the excellence of a man is to divine
                                the future so far as it can be grasped by reason. When his brother
                                grumbled that he was not made ephor as Chilon was, the latter
                                replied, <q>I know how to submit to injustice and you do not.</q> He
                                was made ephor in the 55th Olympiad; Pamphila, however, says the
                                56th. He first became ephor, according to Sosicrates, in the
                                archonship of Euthydemus.
    <pb n="71"/> He first proposed the
                                appointment of ephors as auxiliaries to the kings, though Satyrus
                                says this was done by Lycurgus.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">There
                                    seems to be some confusion in these extracts. Possibly Diogenes
                                    Laertius found among his materials some such note as this:
                                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χίλων τῶν ἑπτὰ σοφῶν πρῶτος

                                    Sosicrates, namely, the archonship of Euthydemus, meticulously
                                    correcting this date from Pamphila. But he seems to have
                                    mislaken the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος
                                        ἔφοροςπρῶτος ἔφορος</foreign> and to have rashly inferred
                                    from it that it was Chilon who introduced the
                                ephorate.</note></p>
<p>As Herodotus relates in his first Book, when
Hippocrates was sacrificing at Olympia and his
cauldrons boiled of their own accord, it was Chilon
who advised him not to marry, or, if he had a wife,
to divorce her and disown his children.</p></div>

                                Being asked wherein lies the difference between the educated and the
                                uneducated, Chilon answered, <q>In good hope.</q> What is hard?
                                <q>To keep a secret, to employ leisure well, to be able to bear
                                an injury.</q> These again are some of his precepts: To control the

<p>Of his songs the most popular is the following: <q>By the whetstone gold is tried, giving

                                one point he was not quite clear. In a suit in which a friend of his
                                was concerned he himself pronounced sentence according to the law,
                                but he persuaded his colleague who was his friend to acquit the

<p>He became very famous in Greece by his warning about the island of Cythera off the Laconian

                                exclaimed: <q>Would it had never been placed there, or else had
                                been sunk in the depths of the sea.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72">
    <p rend="merge">And this was a wise warning; for
Demaratus, when an exile from Sparta, advised

<head>Chapter 4. PITTACUS (c. 600B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74">
<p>Pittacus was the son of Hyrrhadius and a native
of Mitylene. Duris calls his father a Thracian.
Aided by the brothers of Alcaeus he overthrew
<pb n='77'/>
Melanchrus, tyrant of Lesbos; and in the war
between Mitylene and Athens for the territory of
Achileis he himself had the chief command on the
one side, and Phrynon, who had won an Olympic
victory in the pancratium, commanded the Athenians.
Pittacus agreed to meet him in single combat; with
a net which he concealed beneath his shield he entangled Phrynon, killed him, and recovered the
territory. Subsequently, as Apollodorus states in
his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology,</hi> Athens and Mitylene referred their
claims to arbitration. Periander heard the appeal
and gave judgement in favour of Athens.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75">
<p>At the time, however, the people of Mitylene
honoured Pittacus extravagantly and entrusted him
with the government. He ruled for ten years
and brought the constitution into order, and then
laid down his office. He lived another ten years
after his abdication and received from the people
of Mitylene a grant of land, which he dedicated
as sacred domain; and it bears his name to this
day Sosicrates relates that he cut off a small
portion for himself and pronounced the half to be
more than the whole. Furthermore, he declined
an offer of money made him by Croesus, saying
that he had twice as much as he wanted; for his
brother had died without issue and he had inherited
his estate.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76">
<p>Pamphila in the second book of her <hi rend="ital">Memorabilia</hi> narrates that, as his son
                                Tyrraeus sat in a barber's shop in Cyme, a smith killed him with a
                                blow from an axe. When the people of Cyme sent the murderer to
                                Pittacus, he, on learning the story, set him at liberty and declared
                                that <q>It is better to pardon now than to repent later.</q>
                                Heraclitus, however, says <pb n="79"/> that it was Alcaeus whom he
                                set at liberty when he had got him in his power, and that what he
                                said was: <q>Mercy is better than vengeance.</q></p>
<p>Among the laws which he made is one providing that for any offence committed in a state of
                                intoxication the penalty should be doubled; his object was to
                                discourage drunkenness, wine being abundant in the island. One of
                                his sayings is, <q>It is hard to be good,</q> which is cited by
                                Simonides in this form: <q>Pittacus's maxim, `Truly to become a

                                answered, <q>The rule of the shifting wood,</q> by which he meant
                                the law. He also urged men to win bloodless victories. When the
                                Phocaean said that we must search for a good man, Pittacus rejoined,
                                <q>If you seek too carefully, you will never find him.</q> He
                                answered various inquiries thus: <q>What is agreeable?</q>

                                daughters, gave them dowries, and restored them to their fathers in
                                Messenia. In course of time, as has been already related, the bronze

                                or their father according to other accounts, including that of
                                Phanodicus, came forward into the assembly and, after the recital of
                                their own adventures, pronounced Bias to be wise. And thereupon the
                                tripod was dispatched to him; but Bias, on seeing it, declared that
                                Apollo was wise, and refused to take the tripod.</p></div>

he dedicated it to Heracles in Thebes, since he was
a descendant of the Thebans who had founded a
colony at Priene; and this is the version of Phanodieus.</p>
<p>A story is told that, while Alyattes was besieging Priene, Bias fattened two mules and drove them
                                into the camp, and that the king, when he saw them, was amazed at
                                the good condition of the citizens actually extending to their

                                a messenger. But Bias piled up heaps of sand with a layer of corn on
                                the top, and showed them to the man, and finally, on being informed
                                of this, Alyattes made a treaty of peace with the people of Priene.
                                Soon afterwards, when Alyattes sent to invite Bias to his court, he
                                replied, <q>Tell Alyattes, from me, to make his diet of onions,</q>

<p>The growth of strength in man is nature's work; but to set forth in speech the interests of one's

                                of wealth to many. He also said that he who could not bear
                                misfortune was truly unfortunate; that it is a disease of the soul
                                to be enamoured of things impossible of attainment; and that we
                                ought not to dwell upon the woes of others. Being asked what is

                                once it is undertaken. Do not be hasty of speech, for that is a sign

<p>Cleobulus, the son of Euagoras, was born at Lindus,
but according to Duris he was a Carian. Some say
that he traced his descent back to Heracles, that he
was distinguished for strength and beauty, and was
acquainted with Egyptian philosophy. He had a
daughter Cleobuline, who composed riddles in hexameters; she is mentioned by Cratinus, who gives
one of his plays her name, in the plural form
Cleobulinae. He is also said to have rebuilt the
temple of Athena which was founded by Danaus.</p>
<pb n='93'/>
<p>He was the author of songs and riddles, making some
3000 lines in all.</p>

<p>The evidence they adduce is a poem of Simonides
in which he says<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 57 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>Who, if he trusts his wits, will praise Cleobulus the dweller
at Lindus for opposing the strength of a column to everflowing rivers, the flowers of spring, the flame of the sun,
and the golden moon and the eddies of the sea? But all
things fall short of the might of the gods; even mortal
hands break marble in pieces; this is a fool's devising.</p>

<head>Chapter 7. PERIANDER (tyrant 625-585 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94">
<p>Periander, the son of Cypselus, was born at Corinth,
of the family of the Heraclidae. His wife was
Lysida, whom he called Melissa. Her father was
Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus, her mother Eristheneia,
daughter of Aristocrates and sister of Aristodemus,
who together reigned over nearly the whole of
Arcadia, as stated by Heraclides of Pontus in his book
<hi rend='ital'>On Government.</hi> By her he had two sons, Cypselus
and Lycophron, the younger a man of intelligence,
the elder weak in mind.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95">
    <p rend="merge">However, after some time,
in a fit of anger, he killed his wife by throwing
a footstool at her, or by a kick, when she was pregnant, having been egged on by the slanderous tales
of concubines, whom he afterwards burnt alive.</p>
<p>When the son whose name was Lycophron grieved
<pb n='99'/>
for his mother, he banished him to Corcyra. And
when well advanced in years he sent for his son to
be his successor in the tyranny; but the Corcyraeans
put him to death before he could set sail. Enraged
at this, he dispatched the sons of the Corcyraeans
to Alyattes that he might make eunuchs of them;
but, when the ship touched at Samos, they took
sanctuary in the temple of Hera, and were saved by
the Samians.</p>
<p>Periander lost heart and died at the age of
eighty. Sosicrates' account is that he died fortyone years before Croesus, just before the 49th
Olympiad.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">584-580 b.c.</note> Herodotus in his first book

his own mother Crateia, and adds that, when the fact
came to light, he vented his annoyance in indiscriminate severity. Ephorus records his now that,
if he won the victory at Olympia in the chariot-race,
he would set up a golden statue. When the victory
was won, being in sore straits for gold, he despoiled
the women of all the ornaments which he had seen
them wearing at some local festival. He was thus
enabled to send the votive offering.</p>
<p>There is a story that he did not wish the place
where he was buried to be known, and to that end
contrived the following device. He ordered two
young men to go out at night by a certain road
which he pointed out to them; they were to kill
the man they met and bury him. He afterwards
ordered four more to go in pursuit of the two, kill
them and bury them; again, he dispatched a larger
<pb n='101'/>
number in pursuit of the four. Having taken these
measures, he himself encountered the first pair and
was slain. The Corinthians placed the following

                                wrote a didactic poem of 2000 lines. He said that those tyrants who
                                intend to be safe should make loyalty their bodyguard, not arms.
                                When some one asked him why he was tyrant, he replied, <q>Because
                                it is as dangerous to retire voluntarily as to be dispossessed.</q>
                                Here are other sayings of his: Rest is beautiful. Rashness has its
                                perils. Gain is ignoble. Democracy is better than tyranny. Pleasures

                                mother was a Greek, and for that reason he spoke both languages. He
                                wrote on the institutions of the Greeks and the Scythians, dealing
                                with simplicity of life and military matters, a poem of 800 lines.
                                So outspoken was he that he furnished occasion for a proverb,
                                <q>To talk like a Scythian.</q></p>
<p>Sosicrates makes him come to Athens about the
47th Olympiad<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">591-588 B.C.</note> in the archonship of
Eucrates.
Hermippus relates that on his arrival at the house
of Solon he told one of the servants to announce
that Anacharsis had come and was desirous of seeing
him and, if possible, of becoming his guest.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102">
    <p rend="merge">The

servant delivered his message and was ordered by
Solon to tell him that men as a rule choose their
guests from among their own countrymen. Then
Anacharsis took him up and said that he was now
in his own country and had a right to be entertained
as a guest. And Solon, struck with his ready wit,
admitted him into his house and made him his
greatest friend.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103">
<p>After a while Anacharsis returned to Scythia, where, owing to his enthusiasm for everything
                                Greek, he was supposed to be subverting the national institutions,
                                and was killed by his brother while they were out hunting together.
                                When struck by the arrow he exclaimed, <q>My reputation carried
                                me safe through Greece, but the envy it excited at home has been my
                                ruin.</q> In some accounts it is said that he was slain while
                                performing Greek rites.</p>
<p>Here is my own epitaph upon him<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 92.</note>:</p>
<p>Back from his travels Anacharsis came,</p>
<p>To hellenize the Scythians all aglow;</p>
<p>Ere half his sermon could their minds inflame,</p>
<p>A wingèd arrow laid the preacher low.</p>
<p>It was a saying of his that the vine bore three kinds of grapes: the first of pleasure, the next
                                of intoxication, and the third of disgust. He said he wondered why
                                in Greece experts contend in the games and non-experts award the
                                prizes. Being asked how one could avoid becoming a toper, he
                                answered, <q>By keeping before your eyes the disgraceful
                                exhibition made by the drunkard.</q> Again, he expressed surprise that
                                the Greek lawgivers should impose penalties on wanton outrage, while
                                they honour athletes for bruising one another. After <pb n="109"/>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104">
<p>Oil he called a drug which produced madness, because the athletes when they anoint themselves
                                with it are maddened against each other. How is it, he asked, that
                                the Greeks prohibit falsehood and yet obviously tell falsehoods in
                                retail trade? Nor could he understand why at the beginning of their

                                from large ones. The inscription on his statues is: <q>Bridle

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106">
<p>Myson was the son of Strymon, according to
Sosicrates, who quotes Hermippus as his authority,
and a native of Chen, a village in the district of
Oeta or Laconia; and he is reckoned one of the
Seven Sages. They say that his father was a tyrant.
We are told by some one that, when Anacharsis
inquired if there were anyone wiser than himself,
the Pythian priestess gave the response which has
already been quoted in the Life of Thales as her reply
to a question by Chilon<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> vi.
40.</note>:</p>
<p>Myson of Chen in Oeta; this is he</p>
<p>Who for wiseheartedness surpasseth thee.</p>
<p>His curiosity aroused, Anacharsis went to the village in summer time and found him fitting a
                                share to a plough and said, <q>Myson, this is not the season for
                                the plough.</q> <q>It is just the time to repair it,</q> was the
                                reply.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107">

                                Etis,</q> and inquire what <pb n="113"/> <q>Myson of Etis</q> means.
                                Parmenides indeed explains that Etis is a district in Laconia to
                                which Myson belonged. Sosicrates in his <hi rend="ital">Successions
                                    of Philosophers</hi> makes him belong to Etis on the father's
                                side and to Chen on the mother's. Euthyphro, the son of Heraclides
                                of Pontus, declares that he was a Cretan, Eteia being a town in
                                Crete. Anaxilaus makes him an Arcadian.</p>
<p>Myson is mentioned by Hipponax, the words

<p>Wisest of all men.</p>
<p>Aristoxenus in his

not unlike Timon and Apemantus, for he was a

                                one was near, he replied, <q>That is just the reason.</q> And
                                Aristoxenus says that the reason why he remained obscure was that he
                                belonged to no city but to a village and that an unimportant one.
                                Hence because he was unknown, some writers, but not Plato the
                                philosopher, attributed to Pisistratus the tyrant what properly
                                belonged to Myson. For Plato mentions him in the <hi rend="ital"

<p>He used to say we should not investigate facts by

<head>Chapter 10. EPIMENIDES (c. 600 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109">
<p>Epimenides, according to Theopompus and many
other writers, was the son of Phaestius; some, however, make him the son of Dosiadas, others of
Agesarchus. He was a native of Cnossos in Crete,
though from wearing his hair long he did not look
like a Cretan. One day he was sent into the country
by his father to look for a stray sheep, and at noon
he turned aside out of the way, and went to sleep
in a cave, where he slept for fifty-seven years. After
this he got up and went in search of the sheep, thinking he had been asleep only a short time. And when
he could not find it, he came to the farm, and found
everything changed and another owner in possession.
Then he went back to the town in utter perplexity;
and there, on entering his own house, he fell in with
people who wanted to know who he was. At length
he found his younger brother, now an old man, and
learnt the truth from him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110">
    <p rend="merge">So he became famous
throughout Greece, and was believed to be a special
favourite of heaven.</p>
<p>Hence, when the Athenians were attacked by
pestilence, and the Pythian priestess bade them
purify the city, they sent a ship commanded by
Nicias, son of Niceratus, to Crete to ask the help of
Epimenides. And he came in the 46th Olympiad,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">595-592
b.c.</note>
purified their city, and stopped the pestilence in the
following way. He took sheep, some black and
others white, and brought them to the Areopagus;
and there he let them go whither they pleased,
instructing those who followed them to mark the
spot where each sheep lay down and offer a sacrifice
to the local divinity. And thus, it is said, the plague
was stayed. Hence even to this day altars may be
<pb n='117'/>
found in different parts of Attica with no name
inscribed upon them, which are memorials of this
atonement. According to some writers he declared
the plague to have been caused by the pollution
which Cylon brought on the city and showed them
how to remove it. In consequence two young men,
Cratinus and Ctesibius, were put to death and the
city was delivered from the scourge.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111">
<p>The Athenians voted him a talent in money and
a ship to convey him back to Crete. The money he
declined, but he concluded a treaty of friendship
and alliance between Cnossos and Athens.</p>
<p>So he returned home and soon afterwards died.
According to Phlegon in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Longevity</hi> he
lived
one hundred and fifty-seven years; according to the
Cretans two hundred and ninety-nine years. Xenophanes of Colophon gives his age as 154, according

ground that it is late and not written in the Cretan

<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Epimenides to Solon</hi></hi></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113">
<p><q>Courage, my friend. For if Pisistratus had attacked the Athenians while they were still
                                serfs and before they had good laws, he would have secured power in
                                perpetuity by the enslavement of the citizens. But, as it is, he is
                                reducing to subjection men who are no cowards, men who with pain and
                                shame remember Solon's warning and will never endure to be under a
                                tyrant. But even should Pisistratus himself hold down the city, I do
                                not expect that his power will be continued to his children; for it
                                is hard to contrive that men brought up as free men under the best
                                laws should be slaves. But, instead of going on your travels, come
                                quietly to Crete to me; for here you will have no monarch to fear,
                                whereas, if some of his friends should fall in with you while you

<p>This is the tenor of the letter. But Demetrius reports a story that he received from the Nymphs food
of a special sort and kept it in a cow's hoof; that he
took small doses of this food, which was entirely
absorbed into his system, and he was never seen to
eat. Timaeus mentions him in his second book.
Some writers say that the Cretans sacrifice to him
<pb n='121'/>
as a god; for they say that he had superhuman
foresight. For instance, when he saw Munichia, at
Athens, he said the Athenians did not know how
many evils that place would bring upon them; for,
if they did, they would destroy it even if they had
to do so with their teeth. And this he said so long
before the event. It is also stated that he was the
first to call himself Aeacus; that he foretold to the
Lacedaemonians their defeat by the Arcadians; and
that he claimed that his soul had passed through
many incarnations.</p></div>

<p><q>May yours be a happy death when your time comes. Since I received your letter, I have been
                                attacked by disease. I am infested with vermin and subject to a
                                violent fever with shivering fits. I have therefore given
                                instructions to my servants to carry my writing to you after they
                                have buried me. I would like you to publish it, provided that you
                                and <pb n="129"/> the other sages approve of it, and not otherwise.
                                For I myself am not yet satisfied with it. The facts are not
                                absolutely correct, nor do I claim to have discovered the truth, but
                                merely such things as one who inquires about the gods picks up. The
                                rest must be thought out, for mine is all guess-work. As I was more
                                and more weighed down with my malady, I did not permit any of the
                                physicians or my friends to come into the room where I was, but, as
                                they stood before the door and inquired how I was, I thrust my
                                finger through the keyhole and showed them how plague-stricken I
                                was; and I told them to come to-morrow to bury Pherecydes.</q></p>
<p>So much for those who are called the Sages, with
whom some writers also class Pisistratus the tyrant.
I must now proceed to the philosophers and start
with the philosophy of Ionia. Its founder was
Thales, and Anaximander was his pupil.</p></div>

<p>Anaximander, the son of Praxiades, was a native of
Miletus. He laid down as his principle and element
that which is unlimited without defining it as air or
water or anything else. He held that the parts
undergo change, but the whole is unchangeable;
that the earth, which is of spherical shape, lies in
the midst, occupying the place of a centre; that
the moon, shining with borrowed light, derives its
illumination from the sun; further, that the sun is
as large as the earth and consists of the purest fire.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">These

bodies, he said, some, like earth, were heavy, occupying the region below, others, light like fire, held the

natural philosophy from Ionia to Athens. Archelaus
was the teacher of Socrates. He was called the
physicist inasmuch as with him natural philosophy
came to an end, as soon as Socrates had introduced
ethics. It would seem that Archelaus himself also
treated of ethics, for he has discussed laws and
goodness and justice; Socrates took the subject
from him and, having improved it to the utmost,
was regarded as its inventor. Archelaus laid down
that there were two causes of growth or becoming,
heat and cold; that living things were produced
from slime; and that what is just and what is base
depends not upon nature but upon convention.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>His theory is to this effect. Water is melted by
heat and produces on the one hand earth in so far
as by the action of fire it sinks and coheres, while
on the other hand it generates air in so far as it
overflows on all sides. Hence the earth is confined
by the air, and the air by the circumambient fire.
Living things, he holds, are generated from the
earth when it is heated and throws off slime of the
consistency of milk to serve as a sort of nourishment,
and in this same way the earth produced man. He
was the first who explained the production of sound
as being the concussion of the air, and the formation
of the sea in hollow places as due to its filtering
through the earth. He declared the sun to be the
largest of the heavenly bodies and the universe to
be unlimited.</p>

<p>He showed his contempt for Archelaus of Macedon
and Scopas of Cranon and Eurylochus of Larissa by
refusing to accept their presents or to go to their
court. He was so orderly in his way of life that on
<pb n='157'/>
several occasions when pestilence broke out in Athens
he was the only man who escaped infection.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p>Aristotle says that he married two wives: his first
wife was Xanthippe, by whom he had a son, Lamprocles; his second wife was Myrto, the daughter of
Aristides the Just, whom he took without a dowry.
By her he had Sophroniscus and Menexenus. Others
make Myrto his first wife; while some writers,
including Satyrus and Hieronymus of Rhodes, affirm
that they were both his wives at the same time.
For they say that the Athenians were short of men
and, wishing to increase the population, passed a
decree permitting a citizen to marry one Athenian
woman and have children by another; and that
Socrates accordingly did so.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<p>He could afford to despise those who scoffed at
him. He prided himself on his plain living, and
never asked a fee from anyone. He used to say that
he most enjoyed the food which was least in need
of condiment, and the drink which made him feel
the least hankering for some other drink; and that
he was nearest to the gods in that he had the fewest
wants. This may be seen from the Comic poets,
who in the act of ridiculing him give him high praise.
Thus Aristophanes<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Clouds</hi>,
412-417.</note>:</p>
<p>O man that justly desirest great wisdom, how blessed will be
thy life amongst Athenians and Greeks, retentive of memory
and thinker that thou art, with endurance of toil for thy
character; never art thou weary whether standing or walking,
<pb n='159'/>
never numb with cold, never hungry for breakfast; from
wine and from gross feeding and all other frivolities thou
dost turn away.</p></div>

<p>Ameipsias too, when he puts him on the stage

can we get you a proper coat?</p>
<p>b. Your sorry plight is an insult to the cobblers.</p>
<p>a. And yet, hungry as he is, this man has never stooped
to flatter.</p>
<p>This disdainful, lofty spirit of his is also noticed by
Aristophanes when he says<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Clouds</hi>,

<p>Because you stalk along the streets, rolling your eyes,

<p>He showed equal ability in both directions, in
persuading and dissuading men; thus, after conversing with Theaetetus about knowledge, he sent
him away, as Plato says, fired with a divine impulse;
but when Euthyphro had indicted his father for
manslaughter, Socrates, after some conversation with
him upon piety, diverted him from his purpose.
Lysis, again, he turned, by exhortation, into a most
virtuous character. For he had the skill to draw
his arguments from facts. And when his son
<pb n='161'/>
Lamprocles was violently angry with his mother,
Socrates made him feel ashamed of himself, as I
believe Xenophon has told us. When Plato's brother
Glaucon was desirous of entering upon politics,
Socrates dissuaded him, as Xenophon relates, because
of his want of experience; but on the contrary he
encouraged Charmides to take up politics because he
had a gift that way.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Mem.</hi> iii.

<p>He roused Iphicrates the general to a martial
spirit by showing him how the fighting cocks of
Midias the barber flapped their wings in defiance of

should be acquired for the state as if he were some
pheasant or peacock.</p>
<p>He used to say it was strange that, if you asked a man how many sheep he had, he could easily
                                tell you the precise number; whereas he could not name his friends
                                or say how many he had, so slight was the value he set upon them.
                                Seeing Euclides keenly interested in eristic arguments, he said to
                                him: <q>You will be able to get on with sophists, Euclides, but
                                with men not at all.</q> For he thought there was no use in this sort
                                of hair-splitting, as Plato shows us in the <hi rend="ital"

<p>Again, when Charmides offered him some slaves in order that he might derive an income from them,
                                he declined the offer; and according to some he scorned the beauty
                                of Alcibiades. He would extol leisure as the best of possessions,
                                according to Xenophon in the <hi rend="ital">Symposium.</hi> There
                                is, he said, only one good, that is, knowledge, and only one evil,
                                that is, ignorance; wealth and good birth bring their possessor no
                                dignity, but on the contrary evil. At all events, when some one told
                                him that Antisthenes' mother <pb n="163"/> was a Thracian, he
                                replied, <q>Nay, did you expect a man so noble to have been born
                                of two Athenian parents?</q> He made Crito ransom Phaedo who, having
                                been taken prisoner in the war, was kept in degrading slavery, and
                                so won him for philosophy.</p></div>

<p>Moreover, in his old age he learnt to play the lyre, declaring that he saw no absurdity in
                                learning a new accomplishment. As Xenophon relates in the <hi

                                thinking that such exercise helped to keep the body in good
                                condition. He used to say that his supernatural sign warned him
                                beforehand of the future; that to make a good start was no trifling
                                advantage, but a trifle turned the scale; and that he knew nothing
                                except just the fact of his ignorance. He said that, when people
                                paid a high price for fruit which had ripened early, they must
                                despair of seeing the fruit ripen at the proper season. And, being
                                once asked in what consisted the virtue of a young man, he said,
                                <q>In doing nothing to excess.</q> He held that geometry should be
                                studied to the point at which a man is able to measure the land

<p>So he was taken from among men; and not long
afterwards the Athenians felt such remorse that they
shut up the training grounds and gymnasia. They
banished the other accusers but put Meletus to death;
they honoured Socrates with a bronze statue, the
work of Lysippus, which they placed in the hall
of processions. And no sooner did Anytus visit
Heraclea than the people of that town expelled him
on that very day. Not only in the case of Socrates
but in very many others the Athenians repented in
this way. For they fined Homer (so says Heraclides<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">Most
probably Heraclides of Pontus. This remarkable

Pythagoras was by Cylon of Croton, or as Homer

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48">
<p>Xenophon, the son of Gryllus, was a citizen of Athens and belonged to the deme Erchia; he was <pb
                                    n="179"/> a man of rare modesty and extremely handsome. The
                                story goes that Socrates met him in a narrow passage, and that he
                                stretched out his stick to bar the way, while he inquired where
                                every kind of food was sold. Upon receiving a reply, he put another
                                question, <q>And where do men become good and honourable?</q>
                                Xenophon was fairly puzzled; <q>Then follow me,</q> said Socrates,
                                <q>and learn.</q> From that time onward he was a pupil of Socrates.
                                He was the first to take notes of, and to give to the world, the
                                conversation of Socrates, under the title of <hi rend="ital"

<p>Aristippus, in the fourth book of his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the

of Clinias,</p></div>

                                to everything else if I could but gaze on him alone. I am vexed with

<p>He gained the friendship of Cyrus in the following
way. He had an intimate friend named Proxenus,
a Boeotian, a pupil of Gorgias of Leontini and a
friend of Cyrus. Proxenus, while living in Sardis at
the court of Cyrus, wrote a letter to Xenophon at
Athens, inviting him to come and seek the friendship
of Cyrus.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
    <p rend="merge">Xenophon showed this letter to Socrates
and asked his advice, which was that he should go
to Delphi and consult the oracle. Xenophon complied and came into the presence of the god. He
inquired, not
<hi rend='ital'>whether</hi> he should go and seek
service
with Cyrus, but
<hi rend='ital'>in what way</hi> he should do so.
For
<pb n='181'/>
this Socrates blamed him, yet at the same time he
advised him to go. On his arrival at the court
of Cyrus he became as warmly attached to him as
Proxenus himself. We have his own sufficient narrative of all that happened on the expedition and on
the return home. He was, however, at enmity with
Meno of Pharsalus, the mercenary general, throughout the expedition, and, by way of abuse, charges
him with having a favourite older than himself.
Again, he reproaches one Apollonides with having
had his ears bored.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anab.</hi> iii. 1.

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
<p>After the expedition and the misfortunes which
overtook it in Pontus and the treacheries of Seuthes,
the king of the Odrysians, he returned to Asia,
having enlisted the troops of Cyrus as mercenaries
in the service of Agesilaus, the Spartan king, to
whom he was devoted beyond measure. About this
time he was banished by the Athenians for siding
with Sparta. When he was in Ephesus and had a
sum of money, he entrusted one half of it to
Megabyzus, the priest of Artemis, to keep until his
return, or if he should never return, to apply to the
erection of a statue in honour of the goddess. But
the other half he sent in votive offerings to Delphi.
Next he came to Greece with Agesilaus, who had
been recalled to carry on the war against Thebes.
And the Lacedaemonians conferred on him a privileged position.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52">
<p>He then left Agesilaus and made his way to Scillus,
a place in the territory of Elis not far from the city.
According to Demetrius of Magnesia he was accompanied by his wife Philesia, and, in a speech written
for the freedman whom Xenophon prosecuted for
neglect of duty, Dinarchus mentions that his two
<pb n='183'/>
sons Gryllus and Diodorus, the Dioscuri as they
were called, also went with him. Megabyzus having
arrived to attend the festival, Xenophon received
from him the deposit of money and bought and
dedicated to the goddess an estate with a river
running through, which bears the same name
Selinus as the river at Ephesus. And from that
time onward he hunted, entertained his friends,
and worked at his histories without interruption.
Dinarchus, however, asserts that it was the
Lacedaemonians who gave him a house and
land.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53">
<p>At the same time we are told that Phylopidas the
Spartan sent to him at Scillus a present of captive
slaves from Dardanus, and that he disposed of them
as he thought fit, and that the Elians marched against
Scillus, and owing to the slowness of the Spartans
captured the place, whereupon his sons retired to
Lepreum with a few of the servants, while Xenophon
himself, who had previously gone to Elis, went next
to Lepreum to join his sons, and then made his
escape with them from Lepreum to Corinth and
took up his abode there. Meanwhile the Athenians
passed a decree to assist Sparta, and Xenophon sent
his sons to Athens to serve in the army in defence
of Sparta.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54">
    <p rend="merge">According to Diocles in his
<hi rend='ital'>Lives of the

Diodorus came safe out of the battle without
performing any distinguished service, and he had a
son of the same name (Gryllus) as his brother.
Gryllus was posted with the cavalry and, in the battle
which took place about Mantinea, fought stoutly and
fell, as Ephorus relates in his twenty-fifth book,
Cephisodorus being in command of the cavalry
<pb n='185'/>
and Hegesilaus commander-in-chief. In this battle
Epaminondas also fell. On this occasion Xenophon
is said to have been sacrificing, with a chaplet on his
head, which he removed when his son's death was
announced. But afterwards, upon learning that he
had fallen gloriously, he replaced the chaplet on his
head.</p></div>

                                epitaphs and eulogies upon Gryllus, who wrote, in part at least, to

man in general, particularly fond of horses and
hunting, an able tactician as is clear from his writings,
<pb n='187'/>
pious, fond of sacrificing, and an expert in augury
from the victims; and he made Socrates his exact
model.</p>
<p>He wrote some forty books in all, though the
division into books is not always the same, namely:</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57">
<p>The Anabasis, with a preface to each separate

these works is by Xenophon. There is a tradition
that he made Thucydides famous by publishing his
history, which was unknown, and which he might
have appropriated to his own use. By the sweetness
of his narrative he earned the name of the Attic

other, as will be stated in the chapter on Plato.</p></div>

<p>Polycritus of Mende, in the first book of his <hi rend="ital">History of Dionysius</hi>, says
                                that he lived with the tyrant until his expulsion from Syracuse, and
                                survived until the return of Dion, and that with him was Carcinus
                                the tragic poet. There is also extant an epistle of Aeschines to
                                Dionysius. That he had received a good rhetorical training is clear
                                from his defence of the father of Phaeax the general, and from his
                                defence of Dion. He is a close imitator of Gorgias of Leontini.
                                Moreover, Lysias attacked him in a speech which he entitled <q>On
                                dishonesty.</q> And from this too it is clear that he was a
                                rhetorician. A single disciple of his is mentioned, Aristotle, whose

<head>Chapter 8. ARISTIPPUS (c. 435-350 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65">
<p>Aristippus was by birth a citizen of Cyrene and,
as Aeschines informs us, was drawn to Athens by
the fame of Socrates. Having come forward as a
lecturer or sophist, as Phanias of Eresus, the Peripatetic, informs us, he was the first of the followers
of Socrates to charge fees and to send money to his
master. And on one occasion the sum of twenty
minae which he had sent was returned to him,
Socrates declaring that the supernatural sign would
not let him take it; the very offer, in fact, annoyed
him. Xenophon was no friend to Aristippus; and
for this reason he has made Socrates direct against
Aristippus the discourse in which he denounces
pleasure.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Mem.</hi> ii. 1.</note> Not but
what Theodorus in his work

Introduction to the
<hi rend='ital'>Phaedo</hi>, 59 c, Aristippus is
said to have been in Aegina on the day when Socrates
drank the hemlock. How little this justifies the use of the
terms
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκάκισεω</foreign> and
<foreign xml:lang="grc">διαβάλλων</foreign> may be seen from the previous statement in the
<hi rend='ital'>Phaedo</hi> that Plato himself
is said to
have been absent through illness on that occasion. Notice
that Diogenes Laertius refers to the Life of Plato as already
written; see iii. 36.</note> as has been shown elsewhere.</p></div>

                                favour than anybody else with Dionysius, because he could always
                                turn the situation to good account. He derived pleasure from what
                                was present, and did not toil to procure the enjoyment of something
                                not present Hence Diogenes called him the king's poodle<note n="c"

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77">

                                manned by pirates, he took out his money and began to count it, and
                                then, as if by inadvertence, he let the money fall into the sea, and
                                naturally broke out into lamentation. Another version of the story
                                attributes to him the further remark that it was better for the
                                money to perish on account of Aristippus than for Aristippus to
                                perish on account of the money. Dionysius once asked him what he was
                                come for, and he said it was to impart what he had and obtain what

pass in review the philosophers of the Cyrenaic school
which sprang from him, although some call themselves followers of Hegesias, others followers of
Anniceris, others again of Theodorus.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">This sentence is a
sort of preface to the valuable summary of Hedonistic tenets which
occupies 86-99 under four heads, Aristippus (86-93), Hegesias (93-96),
Anniceris (96,
97), and Theodorus (97-99).
<hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> note on i. 19 and
Epiphanius(Diels,
<hi rend='ital'>Dox. Gr.</hi> 591). It seems as if the
sentence
<foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος δὲ...ἀναδιδομἐνην</foreign> 
    ought to follow, not to precede,
this preface. But before the doctrines comes a list of disciples,
including
Hegesias, Anniceris, and Theodorus, whose divergencies from
Aristippus are noted below. The intrusion of Phaedo and
the Eretrians at this stage is certainly strange: it looks as
if Diogenes Laertius jotted down a direction for his own
future guidance.</note> Not but
what we shall notice further the pupils of Phaedo,
the chief of whom were called the school of Eretria. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86">
    <p rend="merge">The case stands thus. The disciples of Aristippus were his daughter Arete,
                                Aethiops of Ptolemais,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">If the city was so
                                    named after a Ptolemy, it is impossible that one of its citizens
                                    could have been contemporary with the first Aristippus, the
                                    companion of Socrates. Even if Aristippus II. was the teacher of
                                    Aethiops the difficulty is not removed.</note>
                                <pb n="217"/> and Antipater of Cyrene. The pupil of Arete was
                                Aristippus, who went by the name of mother-taught, and his pupil was
                                Theodorus, known as the atheist, subsequently as <q>god.</q>
                                Antipater's pupil was Epitimides of Cyrene, his was Paraebates, and
                                he had as pupils Hegesias, the advocate of suicide, and Anniceris,
                                who ransomed Plato.</p>
<p>Those then who adhered to the teaching of
Aristippus and were known as Cyrenaics held the
following opinions. They laid down that there are
two states, pleasure and pain, the former a smooth,
the latter a rough motion, and that pleasure does
not differ from pleasure nor is one pleasure more
pleasant than another. T </p></div>
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87">
    <p rend="merge">he one state is agreeable and the other repellent to all living things. However,
                                the bodily pleasure which is the end is, according to Panaetius in
                                his work <hi rend="ital">On the Sects</hi>, not the settled pleasure
                                following the removal of pains, or the sort of freedom from
                                discomfort which Epicurus accepts and maintains to be the end. They
                                also hold that there is a difference between <q>end</q> and
                                <q>happiness.</q> Our end is particular pleasure, whereas happiness
                                is the sum total of all particular pleasures, in which are included
                                both past and future pleasures.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88">
<p>Particular pleasure is desirable for its own sake,
whereas happiness is desirable not for its own sake
but for the sake of particular pleasures. That
pleasure is the end is proved by the fact that from
our youth up we are instinctively attracted to it,
and, when we obtain it, seek for nothing more,
and shun nothing so much as its opposite, pain.
Pleasure is good even if it proceed from the most
unseemly conduct, as Hippobotus says in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects.</hi> For even if the action be
irregular,
<pb n='219'/>
still, at any rate, the resultant pleasure is desirable
for its own sake and is good. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89">
    <p rend="merge">The removal of
pain, however, which is put forward in Epicurus,
seems to them not to be pleasure at all, any more
than the absence of pleasure is pain. For both
pleasure and pain they hold to consist in motion,
whereas absence of pleasure like absence of pain is
not motion, since painlessness is the condition of one
who is, as it were, asleep. They assert that some
people may fail to choose pleasure because their
minds are perverted; not all mental pleasures and
pains, however, are derived from bodily counterparts. For instance, we take disinterested delight
in the prosperity of our country which is as real as
our delight in our own prosperity. Nor again do they
admit that pleasure is derived from the memory or
expectation of good, which was a doctrine of Epicurus. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90">
    <p rend="merge">For they assert that the movement affecting the mind
is exhausted in course of time. Again they hold
that pleasure is not derived from sight or from
hearing alone. At all events, we listen with pleasure
to imitation of mourning, while the reality causes
pain. They gave the names of absence of pleasure
and absence of pain to the intermediate conditions.
However, they insist that bodily pleasures are far
better than mental pleasures, and bodily pains far
worse than mental pains, and that this is the reason
why offenders are punished with the former. For
they assumed pain to be more repellent, pleasure
more congenial. For these reasons they paid more
attention to the body than to the mind. Hence,
although pleasure is in itself desirable, yet they hold
that the things which are productive of certain
pleasures are often of a painful nature, the very
<pb n='221'/>
opposite of pleasure; so that to accumulate the
pleasures which are productive of happiness appears
to them a most irksome business.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91">
<p>They do not accept the doctrine that every wise
man lives pleasantly and every fool painfully, but
regard it as true for the most part only. It is
sufficient even if we enjoy but each single pleasure
as it comes. They say that prudence is a good,
though desirable not in itself but on account of its
consequences; that we make friends from interested
motives, just as we cherish any part of the body so
long as we have it; that some of the virtues are
found even in the foolish; that bodily training contributes to the acquisition of virtue; that the sage
will not give way to envy or love or superstition,
since these weaknesses are due to mere empty
opinion; he will, however, feel pain and fear, these
being natural affections;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92">
    <p rend="merge">and that wealth too is
productive of pleasure, though not desirable for its
own sake.</p>
<p>They affirm that mental affections can be known,
but not the objects from which they come; and
they abandoned the study of nature because of its
apparent uncertainty, but fastened on logical inquiries because of their utility. But Meleager in his
second book
<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophical Opinions</hi>, and Clitomachus in his first book
<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects</hi>, affirm that
they
maintain Dialectic as well as Physics to be useless,
since, when one has learnt the theory of good and
evil, it is possible to speak with propriety, to be free
from superstition, and to escape the fear of death. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93">
    <p rend="merge">They also held that nothing is just or honourable or
base by nature, but only by convention and custom.
Nevertheless the good man will be deterred from
<pb n='223'/>
wrong-doing by the penalties imposed and the prejudices that it would arouse. Further that the wise
man really exists. They allow progress to be attainable in philosophy as well as in other matters. They
maintain that the pain of one man exceeds that of
another, and that the senses are not always true and
trustworthy.</p>
<p>The school of Hegesias, as it is called, adopted the
same ends, namely pleasure and pain. In their view
there is no such thing as gratitude or friendship or
beneficence, because it is not for themselves that we
choose to do these things but simply from motives
of interest, apart from which such conduct is nowhere
found.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94">
    <p rend="merge">They denied the possibility of happiness, for
the body is infected with much suffering, while the
soul shares in the sufferings of the body and is a
prey to disturbance, and fortune often disappoints.
From all this it follows that happiness cannot be
realized. Moreover, life and death are each desirable
in turn. But that there is anything naturally
pleasant or unpleasant they deny; when some men
are pleased and others pained by the same objects,
this is owing to the lack or rarity or surfeit of such
objects. Poverty and riches have no relevance to
pleasure; for neither the rich nor the poor as such
have any special share in pleasure.</p></div>

pleasure. To the fool life is advantageous, while to
the wise it is a matter of indifference. The wise man
will be guided in all he does by his own interests,
for there is none other whom he regards as equally
deserving. For supposing him to reap the greatest
advantages from another, they would not be equal to
<pb n='225'/>
what he contributes himself. They also disallow
the claims of the senses, because they do not lead
to accurate knowledge. Whatever appears rational
should be done. They affirmed that allowance should
be made for errors, for no man errs voluntarily, but
under constraint of some suffering; that we should
not hate men, but rather teach them better. The
wise man will not have so much advantage over
others in the choice of goods as in the avoidance of
evils, making it his end to live without pain of body
or mind.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96">
    <p rend="merge">This then, they say, is the advantage
accruing to those who make no distinction between
any of the objects which produce pleasure.</p>
<p>The school of Anniceris in other respects agreed
with them, but admitted that friendship and gratitude and respect for parents do exist in real life, and
that a good man will sometimes act out of patriotic
motives. Hence, if the wise man receive annoyance,
he will be none the less happy even if few pleasures
accrue to him. The happiness of a friend is not in
itself desirable, for it is not felt by his neighbour.
Instruction is not sufficient in itself to inspire us
with confidence and to make us rise superior to the
opinion of the multitude. Habits must be formed
because of the bad disposition which has grown up
in us from the first.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97">
    <p rend="merge">A friend should be cherished
not merely for his utility--for, if that fails, we should
then no longer associate with him--but for the good
feeling for the sake of which we shall even endure
hardships. Nay, though we make pleasure the end
and are annoyed when deprived of it, we shall
nevertheless cheerfully endure this because of our
love to our friend.</p>
<p>The Theodoreans derived their name from Theodorus,
<pb n='227'/>
who has already been mentioned, and adopted
his doctrines. Theodorus was a man who utterly
rejected the current belief in the gods. And I have
come across a book of his entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Of the Gods</hi>
which
is not contemptible. From that book, they say,
Epicurus borrowed most of what he wrote on the
subject.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98">
<p>Theodorus was also a pupil of Anniceris and of
Dionysius the dialectician, as Antisthenes mentions
in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> He considered
joy
and grief to be the supreme good and evil, the one
brought about by wisdom, the other by folly. Wisdom and justice he called goods, and their opposites
evils, pleasure and pain being intermediate to good
and evil. Friendship he rejected because it did not
exist between the unwise nor between the wise;
with the former, when the want is removed, the
friendship disappears, whereas the wise are selfsufficient and have no need of friends. It was
reasonable, as he thought, for the good man not to
risk his life in the defence of his country, for he would
never throw wisdom away to benefit the unwise.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99">
<p>He said the world was his country. Theft, adultery, and sacrilege would be allowable upon

                                have removed the prejudice against them, which is kept up in order
                                to hold the foolish multitude together. The wise man would indulge
                                his passions openly without the least regard to circumstances. Hence
                                he would use such arguments as this. <q>Is a woman who is skilled

<head>Chapter 9. PHAEDO</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105">
<p>Phaedo was a native of Elis, of noble family, who
on the fall of that city was taken captive and forcibly
consigned to a house of ill-fame. But he would
close the door and so contrive to join Socrates'
circle, and in the end Socrates induced Alcibiades
or Crito with their friends to ransom him; from that
time onwards he studied philosophy as became a
free man. Hieronymus in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Suspense of
Judgement</hi> attacks him and calls him a slave. Of the
dialogues which bear his name the
<hi rend='ital'>Zopyrus</hi> and
<hi
rend='ital'>Simon</hi>
are genuine; the
<hi rend='ital'>Nicias</hi> is doubtful; the
<hi
rend='ital'>Medius</hi> is
said by some to be the work of Aeschines, while
<pb n='235'/>
others ascribe it to Polyaenus; the
<hi rend='ital'>Antimachus</hi>
or
<hi rend='ital'>The Elders</hi> is also doubted; the
<hi
rend='ital'>Cobblers' Tales</hi> are
also by some attributed to Aeschines.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by Plistanus of Elis, and a
generation later by Menedemus of Eretria and
Asclepiades of Phlius, who came over from Stilpo's
school. Till then the school was known as that of
Elis, but from Menedemus onward it was called the
Eretrian school. Of Menedemus we shall have to
speak hereafter, because he too started a new school.</p>

<head>Chapter 10. EUCLIDES</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106">
<p>Euclides was a native of Megara on the Isthmus,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">So called
to distinguish it from Megara Hyblaea, in
Sicily.</note>or according to some of Gela, as Alexander states in
his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> He applied
himself
to the writings of Parmenides, and his followers were
called Megarians after him, then Eristics, and at a
later date Dialecticians, that name having first been
given to them by Dionysius of Chalcedon because
they put their arguments into the form of question
and answer. Hermodorus tells us that, after the
death of Socrates, Plato and the rest of the philosophers came to him, being alarmed at the cruelty
of the tyrants. He held the supreme good to be
really one, though called by many names, sometimes
wisdom, sometimes God, and again Mind, and so
forth. But all that is contradictory of the good he
used to reject, declaring that it had no existence.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107">
<p>When he impugned a demonstration, it was not
the premisses but the conclusion that he attacked.
He rejected the argument from analogy, declaring
that it must be taken either from similars or from
<pb n='237'/>
dissimilars. If it were drawn from similars, it is with
these and not with their analogies that their arguments should deal; if from dissimilars, it is gratuitous
to set them side by side. Hence Timon says of him,
with a side hit at the other Socratics as well<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 28

said much to discredit him.</p>
<p>Among other members the school of Eubulides
included Alexinus of Elis, a man very fond of controversy, for which reason he was called Elenxinus.
In particular he kept up a controversy with Zeno.
Hermippus says of him that he left Elis and removed
to Olympia, where he studied philosophy. His pupils
inquired why he took up his abode here, and were
<pb n='239'/>
told that it was his intention to found a school which
should be called the Olympian school. But as their
provisions ran short and they found the place unhealthy, they left it, and for the rest of his days
Alexinus lived in solitude with a single servant.
And some time afterwards, as he was swimming in
the Alpheus, the point of a reed ran into him, and
of this injury he died.</p></div>

that great man Alexinus, before he could cross the Alpheus,
was pricked by a reed and met his death.</p>
<p>He has written not only a reply to Zeno but other
works, including one against Ephorus the historian.</p>
<p>To the school of Eubulides also belonged Euphantus
of Olynthus, who wrote a history of his own times.
He was besides a poet and wrote several tragedies,
with which he made a great reputation at the
festivals. He taught King Antigonus<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi

them Apollonius surnamed Cronus. He had a pupil
Diodorus, the son of Ameinias of Iasus, who was

Callimachus in his

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113">
<p>Stilpo, a citizen of Megara in Greece, was a pupil of some of the followers of Euclides, although
                                others make him a pupil of Euclides himself, and furthermore of
                                Thrasymachus of Corinth, who was the friend of Ichthyas, according
                                to Heraclides. And so far did he excel all the rest in inventiveness
                                and sophistry that nearly the whole of Greece was attracted to <pb

                                cite the exact words of Philippus the Megarian philosopher:
                                <q>for from Theophrastus he drew away the theorist Metrodorus and
                                Timagoras of Gela, from Aristotle the Cyrenaic philosopher,
                                Clitarchus, and Simmias; and as for the dialecticians themselves, he
                                gained over Paeonius from Aristides; Diphilus of Bosphorus, the son
                                of Euphantus, and Myrmex, the son of Exaenetus, who had both come to
                                refute him, he made his devoted adherents.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114">
    <p rend="merge">And besides these
he won over Phrasidemus the Peripatetic, an accomplished physicist, and Alcimus the rhetorician, the
first orator in all Greece; Crates, too, and many
others he got into his toils, and, what is more, along
with these, he carried off Zeno the Phoenician.</p>
<p>He was also an authority on politics.</p>
<p>He married a wife, and had a mistress named Nicarete, as Onetor has somewhere stated. He had a
                                profligate daughter, who was married to his friend Simmias of
                                Syracuse. And, as she would not live by rule, some one told Stilpo
                                that she was a disgrace to him. To this he replied, <q>Not so,

<p>Ptolemy Soter, they say, made much of him, and

a sum of money and invited him to return with him

moderate sum, and he declined the proposed journey,
and removed to Aegina until Ptolemy set sail.
Again, when Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, had
taken Megara, he took measures that Stilpo's house
should be preserved and all his plundered property
restored to him. But when he requested that a
schedule of the lost property should be drawn up,
<pb n='245'/>
Stilpo denied that he had lost anything which really
belonged to him, for no one had taken away his learning, while he still had his eloquence and knowledge.</p></div>

<p>And conversing upon the duty of doing good to men he made such an impression on the king that he
                                became eager to hear him. There is a story that he once used the
                                following argument concerning the Athena of Phidias: <q>Is it not
                                Athena the daughter of Zeus who is a goddess?</q> And when the other
                                said <q>Yes,</q> he went on, <q>But this at least is not by Zeus
                                but by Phidias,</q> and, this being granted, he concluded, <q>This
                                then is not a god.</q> For this he was summoned before the Areopagus;
                                he did not deny the charge, but contended that the reasoning was
                                correct, for that Athena was no god but a goddess; it was the male
                                divinities who were gods. However, the story goes that the
                                Areopagites ordered him to quit the city, and that thereupon
                                Theodorus, whose nickname was <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                                >Θεός</foreign>, said in derision, <q>Whence did Stilpo learn
                                this? and how could he tell whether she was a god or a goddess?</q> But
                                in truth Theodorus was most impudent, and Stilpo most ingenious.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117">
<p>When Crates asked him whether the gods take delight in prayers and adorations, he is said to have
                                replied, <q>Don't put such a question in the street, simpleton,
                                but when we are alone!</q> It is said that Bion, when he was asked the

<p>Will you not scatter the crowd from me, O much-enduring
elder?</p>
<p>In character Stilpo was simple and unaffected, and he could readily adapt himself to the plain
                                man. For instance, when Crates the Cynic did not answer the question
                                put to him and only insulted the questioner,
    <pb n="247"/>
    <q>I knew,</q> said Stilpo, <q>that you would utter anything rather than
                                what you ought.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118">
    <p rend="merge">And once when Crates held out a fig to him when putting a question, he took the
                                fig and ate it. Upon which the other exclaimed, <q>O Heracles, I
                                have lost the fig,</q> and Stilpo remarked, <q>Not only that but
                                your question as well, for which the fig was payment in advance.</q>
                                Again, on seeing Crates shrivelled with cold in the winter, he said,

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119">
<p>It is said that at Athens he so attracted the public that people would run together from the
                                workshops to look at him. And when some one said, <q>Stilpo, they
                                stare at you as if you were some strange creature.</q> <q>No,
                                indeed,</q> said he, <q>but as if I were a genuine man.</q> And, being
                                a consummate master of controversy, he used to demolish even the
                                ideas, and say that he who asserted the existence of Man meant no
                                individual; he did not mean this man or that. For why should he mean
                                the one more than the other? Therefore neither does he mean this
                                individual man. Again, <q>vegetable</q> is not what is shown to me,
                                for vegetable existed ten thousand years ago. Therefore this is not
                                vegetable. The story goes that while in the middle of an argument
                                with Crates he hurried off to buy fish, and, when Crates tried to
                                detain him and urged that he was leaving the argument, his answer
                                was, <q>Not I. I <pb n="249"/> keep the argument though I am

<head>Chapter 17. MENEDEMUS</head>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" rend="merge">
<p>Menedemus belonged to Phaedo's school; he was
the son of Clisthenes, a member of the clan called
the Theopropidae, of good family, though a builder
and a poor man; others say that he was a scenepainter and that Menedemus learnt both trades.
Hence, when he had proposed a decree, a certain
Alexinius attacked him, declaring that the philosopher
was not a proper person to design either a scene or
a decree. When Menedemus was dispatched by
the Eretrians to Megara on garrison duty, he paid
a visit to Plato at the Academy and was so captivated
that he abandoned the service of arms.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126">
    <p rend="merge">Asclepiades
of Phlius drew him away, and he lived at Megara
with Stilpo, whose lectures they both attended.</p>
<pb n='259'/>
<p>Thence they sailed to Elis, where they joined
Anchipylus and Moschus of the school of Phaedo.
Down to their time, as was stated in the Life of
Phaedo, the school was called the Elian school.
Afterwards it was called the Eretrian school, from
the city to which my subject belonged.</p>
<p>It would appear that Menedemus was somewhat
pompous. Hence Crates burlesques him thus<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 2
D.</note>:</p>
<p>Asclepiades the sage of Phlius and the Eretrian bull;</p>
<p>and Timon as follows<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 29 D.</note>:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>A puffing, supercilious purveyor of
humbug.</hi></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127">
<p>He was a man of such dignity that, when Eurylochus of Casandrea was invited by Antigonus to
court along with Cleïppides, a youth of Cyzicus, he
declined the invitation, being afraid that Menedemus
would hear of it, so caustic and outspoken was he.
When a young gallant would have taken liberties
with him, he said not a word but picked up a twig
and drew an insulting picture on the ground, until
all eyes were attracted and the young man, perceiving the insult, made off. When Hierocles, who
was in command of the Piraeus, walked up and
down along with him in the shrine of Amphiaraus,
and talked much of the capture of Eretria, he made
no other reply beyond asking him what Antigonus's
object was in treating him as he did.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128">
<p>To an adulterer who was giving himself airs he said, <q>Do you not know that, if cabbage has a
                                good flavour, so for that matter has radish?</q> Hearing a youth who
                                was very noisy, he said, <q>See what there is behind you.</q> When
                                Antigonus consulted him as to whether he should go to a rout, he
                                sent <pb n="261"/> a message to say no more than this, that he was
                                the son of a king. When a stupid fellow related something to him
                                with no apparent object, he inquired if he had a farm. And hearing
                                that he had, and that there was a large stock of cattle on it, he
                                said, <q>Then go and look after them, lest it should happen that
                                they are ruined and a clever farmer thrown away.</q> To one who
                                inquired if the good man ever married, he replied, <q>Do you
                                think me good or not?</q> The reply being in the affirmative, he said,
                                <q>Well, I am married.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129">
    <p rend="merge">Of one who affirmed that
there were many good things, he inquired how many,
and whether he thought there were more than a
hundred. Not being able to curb the extravagance
of some one who had invited him to dinner, he said
nothing when he was invited, but rebuked his host
tacitly by confining himself to olives. However, on
account of this freedom of speech he was in great
peril in Cyprus with his friend Asclepiades when
staying at the court of Nicocreon. For when the
king held the usual monthly feast and invited these
two along with the other philosophers, we are told
that Menedemus said that, if the gathering of such
men was a good thing, the feast ought to have been
held every day; if not, then it was superfluous even
on the present occasion.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130">
    <p rend="merge">The tyrant having replied
to this by saying that on this day he had the
leisure to hear philosophers, he pressed the point
still more stubbornly, declaring, while the feast was
going on, that any and every occasion should be
employed in listening to philosophers. The consequence was that, if a certain flute-player had not
got them away, they would have been put to death.
Hence when they were in a storm in the boat
<pb n='263'/>
Asclepiades is reported to have said that the fluteplayer through good playing had proved their salvation when the free speech of Menedemus had been
their undoing.</p>
<p>He shirked work, it is said, and was indifferent to
the fortunes of his school. At least no order could be
seen in his classes, and no circle of benches; but each
man would listen where he happened to be, walking or
sitting, Menedemus himself behaving in the same way.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131">
    <p rend="merge">In other respects he is said to have been nervous and
careful of his reputation; so much so that, when
Menedemus himself and Asclepiades were helping
a man who had formerly been a builder to build a
house, whereas Asclepiades appeared stripped on the
roof passing the mortar, Menedemus would try to
hide himself as often as he saw anyone coming.
After he took part in public affairs, he was so nervous
that, when offering the frankincense, he would
actually miss the censer. And once, when Crates
stood about him and attacked him for meddling in
politics, he ordered certain men to have Crates
locked up. But Crates none the less watched him
as he went by and, standing on tiptoe, called him a
pocket Agamemnon and Hegesipolis.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132">
<p>He was also in a way rather superstitious. At all
events once, when he was at an inn with Asclepiades
and had inadvertently eaten some meat which had
been thrown away, he turned sick and pale when he
learnt the fact, until Asclepiades rebuked him, saying
that it was not the meat which disturbed him but
merely his suspicion of it. In all other respects he
was magnanimous and liberal. In his habit of body,
even in old age, he was as firm and sunburnt in
appearance as any athlete, being stout and always
<pb n='265'/>
in the pink of condition; in stature he was wellproportioned, as may be seen from the statuette in
the ancient Stadium at Eretria. For it represents
him, intentionally no doubt, almost naked, and displays the greater part of his body.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133">
<p>He was fond of entertaining and used to collect
numerous parties about him because Eretria was
unhealthy; amongst these there would be parties of
poets and musicians. He welcomed Aratus also and
Lycophron the tragic poet, and Antagoras of Rhodes,
but, above all, he applied himself to the study of
Homer and, next, the Lyric poets; then to Sophocles,
and also to Achaeus, to whom he assigned the second
place as a writer of satiric dramas, giving Aeschylus
the first. Hence he quoted against his political
opponents the following lines<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Nauck,
<hi
rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>,
<hi
rend='ital'>Achaeus</hi>, 34.</note>:</p>
<p>Ere long the swift is overtaken by the feeble,</p>
<p>And the eagle by the tortoise,</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134">
<p>which are from the
<hi rend='ital'>Omphale</hi>, a satiric drama of
Achaeus. Therefore it is a mistake to say that he
had read nothing except the
<hi rend='ital'>Medea</hi> of Euripides,
which some have asserted to be the work of Neophron
of Sicyon.</p>
<p>He despised the teachers of the school of Plato and Xenocrates as well as the Cyrenaic
                                philosopher Paraebates. He had a great admiration for Stilpo; and on
                                one occasion, when he was questioned about him, he made no other
                                answer than that he was a gentleman. Menedemus was difficult to see

<p>It is said that he disallowed negative propositions, converting them into affirmatives, and of

                                are not simple, I mean hypothetical and complex propositions.
                                Heraclides declares that, although in his doctrines he was a

                                once inquired if he had left off beating his father, his answer was,
                                <q>Why, I was not beating him and have not left off</q>; and upon

                                asserts that he never wrote or composed anything, and so never held
                                firmly by any doctrine. He adds that in discussing questions he was
                                so pugnacious that he would only retire after he had been badly
                                mauled. And yet, though he was so violent in debate, he was as mild
                                as possible in his conduct. For instance, though he made sport of

<p>He was a very warm friend, as is shown by his
affection for Asclepiades, which was hardly inferior
to the devotion shown by Pylades. But, Asclepiades
being the elder, it was said that he was the playwright and Menedemus the actor. They say that
once, when Archipolis had given them a cheque for
half a talent, they stickled so long over the point as
to whose claim came second that neither of them
got the money. It is said that they married a
mother and her daughter; Asclepiades married the
daughter and Menedemus the mother. But after
the death of his own wife, Asclepiades took the wife
of Menedemus; and afterwards the latter, when he
became head of the state, married a rich woman as
his second wife.  Nevertheless, as they kept one
household, Menedemus entrusted his former wife
with the care of his establishment.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138">
    <p rend="merge">However,
Asclepiades died first at a great age at Eretria,
having lived with Menedemus economically, though
they had ample means. Some time afterwards a
favourite of Asclepiades, having come to a party
and being refused admittance by the pupils,
Menedemus ordered them to admit him, saying
that even now, when under the earth, Asclepiades
opened the door for him. It was Hipponicus the
Macedonian and Agetor of Lamia who were their
chief supporters; the one gave each of the two
thirty minae, while Hipponicus furnished Menedemus
with two thousand drachmae with which to portion
his daughters. There were three of them according
to Heraclides, his children by a wife who was a
native of Oropus.</p></div>

<p>He used to give his parties in this fashion: he
would breakfast beforehand with two or three friends
and stay until it was late in the day. And in the
next place some one would summon the guests who
had arrived and who had themselves already dined,
so that, if anyone came too soon, he would walk up
and down and inquire from those who came out of
the house what was on the table and what o'clock
it was. If then it was only vegetables or salt fish,
they would depart; but if there was meat, they
would enter the house. In the summer time a rush
mat was put upon each couch, in winter time a sheepskin. The guest brought his own cushion. The
loving-cup which was passed round was no larger
than a pint cup. The dessert consisted of lupins or
beans, sometimes of ripe fruit such as pears, pomegranates, a kind of pulse, or even dried figs.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140">
    <p rend="merge">All of
these facts are mentioned by Lycophron in his

<p>And after a temperate feast the modest cup was passed
round with discretion, and their dessert was temperate discourse for such as cared to listen.</p>
<p>At first he was despised, being called a cynic and
a humbug by the Eretrians. But afterwards he was
greatly admired, so much so that they entrusted him
with the government of the state. He was sent as
envoy to Ptolemy and to Lysimachus, being honoured
wherever he went. He was, moreover, envoy to
Demetrius, and he caused the yearly tribute of
two hundred talents which the city used to pay
Demetrius to be reduced by fifty talents. And
when he was accused to Demetrius of intriguing
to hand over the city to Ptolemy, he defended
<pb n='273'/>
himself in a letter which commences thus:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141">
    <p rend="merge"><q>Menedemus to King Demetrius, greeting. I hear that a report has reached
                                you concerning me.</q> There is a tradition that one Aeschylus who
                                belonged to the opposite party had made these charges against him.
                                He seems to have behaved with the utmost dignity in the embassy to
                                Demetrius on the subject of Oropus, as Euphantus relates in his <hi
                                    rend="ital">Histories.</hi> Antigonus too was much attached to
                                him and used to proclaim himself his pupil. And when he vanquished
                                the barbarians near the town of Lysimachia, Menedemus moved a decree
                                in his honour in simple terms and free from flattery, beginning
                                thus:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142">
    <p rend="merge"><q>On the motion of the generals and the councillors--Whereas King Antigonus
                                is returning to his own country after vanquishing the barbarians in

                                his will, the senate and the people have decreed. . .</q></p>
<p>On these grounds, then, and from his friendship for
him in other matters, he was suspected of betraying
the city to Antigonus, and, being denounced by
Aristodemus, withdrew from Eretria and stayed
awhile in Oropus in the temple of Amphiaraus.
And, because some golden goblets were missing
from the temple, he was ordered to depart by a
general vote of the Boeotians, as is stated by
Hermippus; and thereupon in despair, after a secret
visit to his native city, he took with him his wife
and daughters and came to the court of Antigonus,
where he died of a broken heart.</p></div

<p>Heraclides tells quite another story, that he was
made councillor of the Eretrians and more than once
saved the city from a tyranny by calling in Demetrius

to Antigonus, but was made the victim of a false
charge; that he betook himself to Antigonus and
was anxious to regain freedom for his country;
that, as Antigonus would not give way, in despair
he put an end to his life by abstaining from food for
seven days. The account of Antigonus of Carystus
is similar.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Antigonus of Carystus (see Introd. p. xxiii) is
the older

Lembos) directly or indirectly derived his information.</note> With
Persaeus alone he carried on open
warfare, for it was thought that, when Antigonus
was willing for Menedemus's sake to restore to the
Eretrians their democracy, Persaeus prevented him. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144">
    <p rend="merge">Hence on one occasion over the wine Menedemus refuted Persaeus in argument and

                                as a man, the worst of all that are alive or to be born
                                hereafter.</q></p>
<p>According to the statement of Heraclides he died
in his seventy-fourth year. I have written the
following epigram upon him<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi>
v. 40.</note>:</p>
<p>I heard of your fate, Menedemus, how, of your own free
will, you expired by starving yourself for seven days, a
deed right worthy of an Eretrian, but unworthy of a man;
but despair was your leader and urged you on.</p>
<p>These then are the disciples of Socrates or their

the founder of the Academy, and his successors, so

<p>Plato was the son of Ariston and a citizen of Athens.
His mother was Perictione (or Potone), who traced
back her descent to Solon. For Solon had a brother,
Dropides; he was the father of Critias, who was the
father of Callaeschrus, who was the father of Critias,
one of the Thirty, as well as of Glaucon, who was the
father of Charmides and Perictione. Thus Plato,
the son of this Perictione and Ariston, was in the
sixth generation from Solon. And Solon traced his
descent to Neleus and Poseidon. His father too is
said to be in the direct line from Codrus, the son of
Melanthus, and, according to Thrasylus, Codrus and
Melanthus also trace their descent from Poseidon.</p></div>

us that there was a story at Athens that Ariston
made violent love to Perictione, then in her bloom,
and failed to win her; and that, when he ceased to
offer violence, Apollo appeared to him in a dream,
whereupon he left her unmolested until her child
was born.</p>
<p>Apollodorus in his

Plato's birth in the 88th Olympiad, on the seventh
day of the month Thargelion, the same day on which

others to Aegina to settle in the island, but returned
to Athens when the Athenians were expelled by the
Lacedaemonians, who championed the Aeginetan

cost being defrayed by Dion, is stated by Athenodorus in the eighth book of a work entitled

saw
a cygnet on his knees, which all at once put forth

<p>From that time onward, having reached his twentieth
year (so it is said), he was the pupil of Socrates.
When Socrates was gone, he attached himself to
Cratylus the Heraclitean, and to Hermogenes who
professed the philosophy of Parmenides. Then at
the age of twenty-eight, according to Hermodorus,
he withdrew to Megara to Euclides, with certain
other disciples of Socrates. Next he proceeded to
Cyrene on a visit to Theodorus the mathematician,
thence to Italy to see the Pythagorean philosophers
Philolaus and Eurytus, and thence to Egypt to see
<pb n='283'/>
those who interpreted the will of the gods; and
Euripides is said to have accompanied him thither.
There he fell sick and was cured by the priests, who
treated him with sea-water, and for this reason he
cited the line<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Eur.

<p><hi rend='center'>The sea doth wash away all human ills.</hi></p></div>

<p>Furthermore he said that, according to Homer,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi
rend='ital'>Od.</hi> iv. 231.</note>
beyond all men the Egyptians were skilled in healing.
Plato also intended to make the acquaintance of the
Magians, but was prevented by the wars in Asia.
Having returned to Athens, he lived in the Academy,
which is a gymnasium outside the walls, in a grove
named after a certain hero, Hecademus, as is stated
by Eupolis in his play entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Shirkers</hi><note

<p><hi rend='center'>In the shady walks of the divine

<p>Moreover, there are verses of Timon which refer to
Plato<note n="d" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 30 D.</note>:</p>
<p>Amongst all of them Plato was the leader, a big fish, but
a sweet-voiced speaker, musical in prose as the cicala who,
perched on the trees of Hecademus, pours forth a strain as
delicate as a lily.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>Thus the original name of the place was Hecademy,
spelt with
<hi rend='ital'>e.</hi> Now Plato was a friend of Isocrates.
And Praxiphanes makes them converse about poets
at a country-seat where Plato was entertaining
Isocrates. And Aristoxenus asserts that he went
on service three times, first to Tanagra, secondly
to Corinth, and thirdly at Delium, where also he
obtained the prize of valour. He mixed together
doctrines of Heraclitus, the Pythagoreans and
<pb n='285'/>
Socrates. In his doctrine of sensible things he
agrees with Heraclitus, in his doctrine of the intelligible with Pythagoras, and in political philosophy
with Socrates.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>Some authorities, amongst them Satyrus, say that he wrote to Dion in Sicily instructing him to
                                purchase three Pythagorean books from Philolaus for 100 minae. For
                                they say he was well off, having received from Dionysius over eighty
                                talents. This is stated by Onetor in an essay upon the theme,
                                <q>Whether a wise man will make money.</q> Further, he derived great
                                assistance from Epicharmus the Comic poet, for he transcribed a
                                great deal from him, as Alcimus says in the essays dedicated to
                                Amyntas, of which there are four. In the first of them he writes
                                thus:</p>

eternal things, the attribute of which is to be ever

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Again, Alcimus makes this further statement: <q>There are some things, say the wise, which the
                                soul perceives through the body, as in seeing and hearing; there are
                                other things which it discerns by itself without the aid of the
                                body. Hence it follows that of existing things some are objects of
                                sense and others objects of thought. Hence Plato said that, if we
                                wish to take in at one glance the principles underlying the
                                universe, we must first distinguish the ideas by themselves, for
                                example, likeness, unity and plurality, magnitude, rest and motion;
                                next we must assume the existence </q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
    <p rend="merge"><q rend="merge">beauty, goodness,
justice and the like, each existing in and for itself;
in the third place we must see how many of the
ideas are relative to other ideas, as are knowledge,
or magnitude, or ownership, remembering that the
things within our experience bear the same names
as those ideas because they partake of them; I
mean that things which partake of justice are just,
things which partake of beauty are beautiful. Each
one of the ideas is eternal, it is a notion, and moreover is incapable of change. Hence Plato says that
they stand in nature like archetypes, and that all
things else bear a resemblance to the ideas because
they are copies of these archetypes. Now here are
the words of Epicharmus about the good and about
the ideas:</q></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
        <p><q rend="merge">a. Is flute-playing a thing?</q></p>

        <p><q rend="merge">a. Well, don't you think the same would be the case with
<pb n='291'/>
the good? Is not the good in itself a thing? And does not
he who has learnt that thing and knows it at once become
good? For, just as he becomes a flute-player by learning
flute-playing, or a dancer when he has learnt dancing, or a
plaiter when he has learnt plaiting, in the same way, if he
has learnt anything of the sort, whatever you like, he would
not be one with the craft but he would be the craftsman.</q></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
        <p><q rend="merge">Now Plato in conceiving his theory of Ideas says<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi

air or fire with which we think, or none of these things, but
the brain which furnishes the senses of hearing and sight
and smell, and from these arise memory and opinion, and
from memory and opinion, when they have become stable, in
the same way knowledge arises.</q></note>:
Since there is such a thing as memory, there must
be ideas present in things, because memory is of
something stable and permanent, and nothing is
permanent except the ideas. `For how,' he says,
`could animals have survived unless they had apprehended the idea and had been endowed by Nature
with intelligence to that end? As it is, they remember similarities and what their food is like,
which shows that animals have the innate power of
discerning what is similar. And hence they perceive others of their own kind.' How then does
Epicharmus put it?</q></p></div>

<p>These and the like instances Alcimus notes through
four books, pointing out the assistance derived by
Plato from Epicharmus. That Epicharmus himself
was fully conscious of his wisdom can also be seen
from the lines in which he foretells that he will have
an imitator<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">This fragment (Fr. 6 D.), which has not the

<p>Plato, it seems, was the first to bring to Athens the mimes of Sophron which had been neglected,
                                and to draw characters in the style of that writer; a copy of the
                                mimes, they say, was actually found under his pillow. He made three
                                voyages to Sicily, the first time to see the island and the craters
                                of Etna: on this occasion Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates, being
                                on the throne, forced him to become intimate with him. But when
                                Plato held forth on tyranny and maintained that the interest of the
                                ruler alone was not the best end, unless he were also pre-eminent in
                                virtue, he offended Dionysius, who in his anger exclaimed, <q>You
                                talk like an old dotard.</q> <q>And you like a tyrant,</q> rejoined

    <p rend="merge">At this the tyrant grew furious and at first was bent
on putting him to death; then, when he had been
dissuaded from this by Dion and Aristomenes, he
did not indeed go so far but handed him over to
Pollis the Lacedaemonian, who had just then arrived
on an embassy, with orders to sell him into slavery.</p>
<pb n='295'/>
<p>And Pollis took him to Aegina and there offered him
for sale. And then Charmandrus, the son of Charmandrides, indicted him on a capital charge according
to the law in force among the Aeginetans, to the
effect that the first Athenian who set foot upon the
island should be put to death without a trial. This
law had been passed by the prosecutor himself,
according to Favorinus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
History.</hi>
But when some one urged, though in jest, that the
offender was a philosopher, the court acquitted him.
There is another version to the effect that he was
brought before the assembly and, being kept under
close scrutiny, he maintained an absolute silence and
awaited the issue with confidence. The assembly
decided not to put him to death but to sell him just
as if he were a prisoner of war.</p></div>

that the Athenians were not the only people worthy
of the privilege of providing for Plato. Others assert
that Dion sent the money and that Anniceris would
not take it, but bought for Plato the little garden

<p>The second time he visited the younger Dionysius,
requesting of him lands and settlers for the realization of his republic. Dionysius promised them but
did not keep his word. Some say that Plato was
also in great danger, being suspected of encouraging
Dion and Theodotas in a scheme for liberating the
whole island; on this occasion Archytas the Pythagorean wrote to Dionysius, procured his pardon, and

<p>Now, as you are an enthusiastic Platonist, and
rightly so, and as you eagerly seek out that philosopher's doctrines in preference to all others, I have
thought it necessary to give some account of the
true nature of his discourses, the arrangement of the
dialogues, and the method of his inductive procedure, as far as possible in an elementary manner
and in main outline, in order that the facts I have
collected respecting his life may not suffer by the
omission of his doctrines. For, in the words of the
proverb, it would be taking owls to Athens, were
I to give you of all people the full particulars.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48">
<p>They say that Zeno the Eleatic was the first to
write dialogues. But, according to Favorinus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, Aristotle in the first book of his
dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>On Poets</hi> asserts that it was Alexamenus of Styra
or
Teos. In my opinion Plato, who brought this form
of writing to perfection, ought to be adjudged the
prize for its invention as well as for its embellishment.
A dialogue is a discourse consisting of question and
answer on some philosophical or political subject,
with due regard to the characters of the persons
introduced and the choice of diction. Dialectic is
the art of discourse by which we either refute or
establish some proposition by means of question and
answer on the part of the interlocutors.</p></div>
<pb n='321'/>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49">
<p>Of the Platonic dialogues there are two most
general types, the one adapted for instruction and
the other for inquiry. And the former is further
divided into two types, the theoretical and the
practical. And of these the theoretical is divided
into the physical and logical, and the practical into
the ethical and political. The dialogue of inquiry
also has two main divisions, the one of which aims at
training the mind and the other at victory in controversy. Again, the part which aims at training
the mind has two subdivisions, the one akin to the
midwife's art, the other merely tentative. And that
suited to controversy is also subdivided into one part
which raises critical objections, and another which
is subversive of the main position.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
<p>I am not unaware that there are other ways in
which certain writers classify the dialogues. For
some dialogues they call dramatic, others narrative,
and others again a mixture of the two. But the
terms they employ in their classification of the
dialogues are better suited to the stage than to
philosophy. Physics is represented by the
<hi rend='ital'>Timaeus</hi>,
logic by the
<hi rend='ital'>Statesman, Cratylus, Parmenides</hi> and
<hi rend='ital'>Sophist</hi>, ethics by the
<hi rend='ital'>Apology,
Crito, Phaedo, Phaedrus</hi>
and
<hi rend='ital'>Symposium</hi>, as well as by the
<hi
rend='ital'>Menexenus, Clitophon</hi>,
the
<hi rend='ital'>Epistles, Philebus, Hipparchus</hi> and the
<hi
rend='ital'>Rivals</hi>, and
lastly politics by the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi>,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
    <p rend="merge">the
<hi
rend='ital'>Laws, Minos,
Epinomis</hi>, and the dialogue concerning Atlantis.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi

To the class of mental obstetrics belong the two
<hi rend='ital'>Alcibiades, Theages, Lysis</hi> and
<hi

<hi rend='ital'>Euthyphro, Meno, Io, Charmides</hi> and

<hi rend='ital'>Euthydemus, Gorgias</hi>, and the two dialogues
entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Hippias</hi> that of subversive argument. So much then
for dialogue, its definition and varieties.</p>
<p>Again, as there is great division of opinion between
those who affirm and those who deny that Plato was
a dogmatist, let me proceed to deal with this further
question. To be a dogmatist in philosophy is to lay
down positive dogmas, just as to be a legislator is
to lay down laws. Further, under dogma two things
are included, the thing opined and the opinion itself.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52">
<p>Of these the former is a proposition, the latter a
conception. Now where he has a firm grasp Plato
expounds his own view and refutes the false one,

His own views are expounded by four persons,

<p>In constructing his proofs he makes most use of induction, not always in the same way, but under
                                two forms. For induction is an argument which by means of certain

                                by agreement appears in two forms, the one proving the particular
                                conclusion under discussion from a particular, the other proceeding
                                by way of the universal [by means of particular facts]. The former
                                is suited to rhetoric, the latter to dialectic. For instance, under
                                the first form the question is raised, <q>Did so-and-so commit a
                                murder?</q> The proof is that he was found at the time with stains of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55">
    <p rend="merge">This is the rhetorical form of induction,
since rhetoric also is concerned with particular facts
and not with universals. It does not inquire about
justice in the abstract, but about particular cases of
justice. The other kind, where the general proposition is first established by means of particular
facts, is the induction of dialectic. For instance, the
question put is whether the soul is immortal, and
whether the living come back from the dead. And
this is proved in the dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi> by
means
of a certain general proposition, that opposites proceed
<pb n='327'/>
from opposites. And the general proposition
itself is established by means of certain propositions
which are particular, as that sleep comes from
waking and

<p>But, just as long ago in tragedy the chorus was
the only actor, and afterwards, in order to give the
chorus breathing space, Thespis devised a single
actor, Aeschylus a second, Sophocles a third, and
thus tragedy was completed, so too with philosophy: in early times it discoursed on one subject
only, namely physics, then Socrates added the second
subject, ethics, and Plato the third, dialectics, and
so brought philosophy to perfection. Thrasylus says
that he published his dialogues in tetralogies, like
those of the tragic poets. Thus they contended with
four plays at the Dionysia, the Lenaea, the Panathenaea and the festival of Chytri.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Pots.</note> Of the

        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63">
<p>Plato has employed a variety of terms in order
to make his system less intelligible to the ignorant.
But in a special sense he considers wisdom to be the
science of those things which are objects of thought
and really existent, the science which, he says, is
concerned with God and the soul as separate from
the body. And especially by wisdom he means
philosophy, which is a yearning for divine wisdom.
And in a general sense all experience is also termed
by him wisdom,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> when he calls a craftsman
wise.
And he applies the same terms with very different
meanings. For instance, the word
<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαῦλος</foreign>
(slight,
plain) is employed by him<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">As
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.
Theaet.</hi> 147 c
    <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶον ἐν τῇ τοῦ πηλοῦ ἐπωτήσει φαῦλόν που καὶ ἁπλοῦν εἰπεῖν ὅτι γῇ ὑγρῷ φυραθεῖσα
    πηλὸς ἂν εἶη, τὸ δ᾽ ὅτου ἐᾶν χαίρειν.</foreign>
<hi rend="italic">Cf. Rep.</hi>527 d
    <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ φαῦλον ἀλλὰ χαλεπὸν πιστεῦσαι.</foreign></note> in the sense of
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπλοῦς</foreign>
(simple, honest), just as it is applied to Heracles in
the
<hi rend='ital'>Licymnius</hi> of Euripides in the following
passage<note n="c" xml:lang="eng">Nauck,
<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi
rend='super'>2</hi>, Eur. 473.</note>:</p>
            <p>Plain (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαῦλος</foreign>), unaccomplished,
staunch to do great deeds,
unversed in talk, with all his store of wisdom curtailed to
action.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64">
    <p>But sometimes Plato uses this same word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαῦλος</foreign>)
to mean what is bad, and at other times for what is
small or petty. Again, he often uses different terms
to express the same thing. For instance, he calls the
Idea form (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>), genus (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>), archetype (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά-δειγμα</foreign>), principle 
(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχή</foreign>) and
cause (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴτιον</foreign>). He also
uses contrary expressions for the same thing. Thus
he calls the sensible thing both existent and non-existent,
<pb n='335'/>
existent inasmuch as it comes into being,
non-existent because it is continually changing. And
he says the Idea is neither in motion nor at rest;
that it is uniformly the same and yet both one and
many. And it is his habit to do this in many more
instances.</p></div>

<p>The right interpretation of his dialogues includes
three things: first, the meaning of every statement
must be explained; next, its purpose, whether it is
made for a primary reason or by way of illustration,
and whether to establish his own doctrines or to
refute his interlocutor; in the third place it remains
to examine its truth.</p>
<p>And since certain critical marks are affixed to his
works let us now say a word about these. The cross
X is taken to indicate peculiar expressions and
figures of speech, and generally any idiom of Platonic
usage; the
<hi rend='ital'>diple</hi><note n="a" xml:lang="eng">A wedge-shaped mark >,

much for the critical marks and his writings in

on all sides in a circle, and is compounded of elements,

two circles which touch one another twice; and the

circles in all. And this interior circle moves by way
of the diagonal to the left, and the other by way of
the side to the right. Hence also the one is supreme,
being a single circle, for the other interior circle was
divided; the former is the circle of the Same, the

<p>Time was created as an image of eternity. And
while the latter remains for ever at rest, time consists in the motion of the universe. For night and
day and month and the like are all parts of time;
for which reason, apart from the nature of the
universe, time has no existence. But so soon as the
universe is fashioned time exists.<note n="f" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>

<p>The principles, then, and causes assumed are the
two above mentioned, of which God and matter are
the exemplar. Matter is of necessity formless like
the other recipients of form. Of all these there is
a necessary cause. For it somehow or other receives
the ideas and so generates substances, and it moves
because its power is not uniform, and, being in
<pb n='345'/>
motion, it in turn sets in motion those things which
are generated from it. And these were at first in
irrational and irregular motion, but after they began

        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78">
<p>On good and evil he would discourse to this effect.
He maintained that the end to aim at is assimilation
to God, that virtue is in itself sufficient for happiness,
but that it needs in addition, as instruments for use,
first, bodily advantages like health and strength,
sound senses and the like, and, secondly, external
advantages such as wealth, good birth and reputation. But the wise man will be no less happy even
if he be without these things. Again, he will take
part in public affairs, will marry, and will refrain
from breaking the laws which have been made. And
as far as circumstances allow he will legislate for
his own country, unless in the extreme corruption of
the people he sees that the state of affairs completely

notion of good as that which is bound up with
<pb n='347'/>
whatever is praiseworthy and rational and useful
and proper and becoming. And all these are bound
up with that which is consistent and in accord with
nature.</p>
<p>He also discoursed on the propriety of names, and
indeed he was the first to frame a science for rightly
asking and answering questions, having employed it
himself to excess. And in the dialogues he conceived
righteousness to be the law of God because it is
stronger to incite men to do righteous acts, that
malefactors may not be punished after death also.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80">
    <p rend="merge">Hence to some he appeared too fond of myths.

<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 42 b.</note> after
death. Such, then, are the doctrines he approved.</p>
<p>He used also to divide things, according to Aristotle, in the following manner.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"> The third appendix begins
here, containing the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">διαιρέσις</foreign>
which are also attributed to Aristotle; see Rose,
<hi
rend='ital'>Aristoteles
Pseudepigraphus,</hi> pp. 679
<hi rend='ital'>sqq.,</hi> who gives a
Christian recension. The original, the common source of Diogenes Laertius
and the Christian writer, he refers vaguely to the Hellenistio
age.</note> Goods are in the
mind or in the body, or external. For example,
justice, prudence, courage, temperance and such like
are in the mind; beauty, a good constitution, health
and strength in the body; while friends, the welfare
of one's country and riches are amongst external
things.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81">
<p>Thus there are three kinds of goods: goods of the
mind, goods of the body and external goods. There
are three species of friendship: one species is natural,
another social, and another hospitable. By natural
friendship we mean the affection which parents have
for their offspring and kinsmen for each other. And
other animals besides man have inherited this form.</p>
<pb n='349'/>
<p>By the social form of friendship we mean that which
arises from intimacy and has nothing to do with
kinship; for instance, that of Pylades for Orestes.
The friendship of hospitality is that which is extended
to strangers owing to an introduction or letters of
recommendation. Thus friendship is either natural
or social or hospitable. Some add a fourth species,
that of love.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82">
<p>There are five forms of civil government: one form
is democratic, another aristocratic, a third oligarchic,
a fourth monarchic, a fifth that of a tyrant. The
democratic form is that in which the people has control and chooses at its own pleasure both magistrates
and laws. The aristocratic form is that in which the
rulers are neither the rich nor the poor nor the
nobles, but the state is under the guidance of the
best. Oligarchy is that form in which there is a
property-qualification for the holding of office; for
the rich are fewer than the poor. Monarchy is
either regulated by law or hereditary. At Carthage
the kingship is regulated by law, the office being
put up for sale.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Plato probably refers to Carthage when he
mentions
<hi rend='ital'>purchasable</hi> kingship,
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠνταὶ βασιλεῖαι</foreign>,
    amongst barbarians,
<hi rend='ital'>Rep.</hi> 544 d. Aristotle repeats the epithet in his
description
of the Carthaginian constitution,
<hi rend='ital'>Pol.</hi> ii. 11,
1273 a 36.
Polybius says that at Carthage magistrates attain office,
<foreign xml:lang="grc">δῶρα φανεπῶς διδόντες</foreign>,
    vi. 56. 4. This phrase is some help
towards an explanation, but whether it means open bribery
--possibly of the people, more probably of the Council--
or whether it refers to very large fees payable upon taking
office, it is not easy to determine. In either case wealth
would preponderate over merit.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83">
    <p rend="merge">But the monarchy in Lacedaemon
and in Macedonia is hereditary, for they select the
king from a certain family. A tyranny is that form
in which the citizens are ruled either through fraud
or force by an individual. Thus civil government
is either democratic, aristocratic, oligarchic, or a
monarchy or a tyranny.</p>
<p>There are three species of justice. One is concerned 
<pb n='351'/>
with gods, another with men, and the third
with the departed. For those who sacrifice according to the laws and take care of the temples are
obviously pious towards the gods. Those again who
repay loans and restore what they have received
upon trust act justly towards men. Lastly, those
who take care of tombs are obviously just towards
the departed. Thus one species of justice relates to
the gods, another to men, while a third species is
concerned with the departed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84">
<p>There are three species of knowledge or science,
one practical, another productive, and a third theoretical. For architecture and shipbuilding are productive arts, since the work produced by them can
be seen. Politics and flute-playing, harp-playing
and similar arts are practical. For nothing visible
is produced by them; yet they do or perform something. In the one case the artist plays the flute or
the harp, in the other the politician takes part in
politics. Geometry and harmonics and astronomy
are theoretical sciences. For they neither perform
nor produce anything. But the geometer considers
how lines are related to each other, the student of
harmony investigates sounds, the astronomer stars
and the universe. Thus some sciences are theoretical,
others are practical, and others are productive.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85">
<p>There are five species of medicine: the first is
pharmacy, the second is surgery, the third deals
with diet and regimen, the fourth with diagnosis,
the fifth with remedies. Pharmacy cures sickness
by drugs, surgery heals by the use of knife and
cautery, the species concerned with diet prescribes
a regimen for the removal of disease, that concerned
with diagnosis proceeds by determining the nature
<pb n='353'/>
of the ailment, that concerned with remedies by
prescribing for the immediate removal of the pain.
The species of medicine, then, are pharmacy, surgery, diet and regimen, diagnosis, prescription of
remedies.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86">
<p>There are two divisions of law, the one written
and the other unwritten. Written law is that under
which we live in different cities, but that which has
arisen out of custom is called unwritten law; for
instance, not to appear in the market-place undressed
or in women's attire. There is no statute forbidding
this, but nevertheless we abstain from such conduct
because it is prohibited by an unwritten law. Thus
law is either written or unwritten.</p>
<p>There are five kinds of speech, of which one is
that which politicians employ in the assemblies;
this is called political speech.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87">
    <p rend="merge">The second division
is that which the rhetors employ in written compositions, whether composed for display or praise or
blame, or for accusation. Hence this division is
termed rhetorical. The third division of speech is
that of private persons conversing with one another;
this is called the mode of speech of ordinary life.
Another division of speech is the language of those
who converse by means of short questions and
answers; this kind is called dialectical. The fifth
division is the speech of craftsmen conversing about
their own subjects; this is called technical language.
Thus speech is either political, or rhetorical, or that
of ordinary conversation, or dialectical, or technical.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88">
<p>Music has three divisions. One employs the mouth
alone, like singing. The second employs both the
<pb n='355'/>
mouth and the hands, as is the case with the harper
singing to his own accompaniment. The third
division employs the hands alone; for instance, the
music of the harp. Thus music employs either the
mouth alone, or the mouth and the hands, or the
hands alone.</p>
<p>Nobility has four divisions. First, when the ancestors are gentle and handsome and also just, their
descendants are said to be noble. Secondly, when
the ancestors have been princes or magistrates, their
descendants are said to be noble. The third kind
arises when the ancestors have been illustrious; for
instance, through having held military command or
through success in the national games. For then
we call the descendants noble.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89">
    <p rend="merge">The last division
includes the man who is himself of a generous and
high-minded spirit. He too is said to be noble.
And this indeed is the highest form of nobility.
Thus, of nobility, one kind depends on excellent
ancestors, another on princely ancestors, a third on
illustrious ancestors, while the fourth is due to the
individual's own beauty and worth.</p>
<p>Beauty has three divisions. The first is the object
of praise, as of form fair to see. Another is serviceable; thus an instrument, a house and the like are
beautiful for use. Other things again which relate
to customs and pursuits and the like are beautiful
because beneficial. Of beauty, then, one kind is
matter for praise, another is for use, and another
for the benefit it procures.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90">
<p>The soul has three divisions. One part of it is
rational, another appetitive, and a third irascible.
Of these the rational part is the cause of purpose,
reflection, understanding and the like. The appetitive 
<pb n='357'/>
part of the soul is the cause of desire of eating,
sexual indulgence and the like, while the irascible
part is the cause of courage, of pleasure and pain,
and of anger. Thus one part of the soul is rational,
another appetitive, and a third irascible.</p>
<p>Of perfect virtue there are four species: prudence,
justice, bravery and temperance.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91">
    <p rend="merge">Of these prudence
is the cause of right conduct, justice of just dealing
in partnerships and commercial transactions. Bravery
is the cause which makes a man not give way but
stand his ground in alarms and perils. Temperance
causes mastery over desires, so that we are never
enslaved by any pleasure, but lead an orderly life.
Thus virtue includes first prudence, next justice,
thirdly bravery, and lastly temperance.</p>
<p>Rule has five divisions, one that which is according
to law, another according to nature, another according to custom, a fourth by birth, a fifth by force.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92">
    <p rend="merge">Now the magistrates in cities when elected by their
fellow-citizens rule according to law. The natural
rulers are the males, not only among men, but
also among the other animals; for the males everywhere exert wide-reaching rule over the females.
Rule according to custom is such authority as
attendants exercise over children and teachers over
their pupils. Hereditary rule is exemplified by that
of the Lacedaemonian kings, for the office of king is
confined to a certain family. And the same system
is in force for the kingdom of Macedonia; for there
too the office of king goes by birth. Others have
<pb n='359'/>
acquired power by force or fraud, and govern the
citizens against their will; this kind of rule is called
forcible. Thus rule is either by law, or by nature,
or by custom, or by birth, or by force.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93">
<p>There are six kinds of rhetoric. For when the
speakers urge war or alliance with a neighbouring
state, that species of rhetoric is called persuasion.
But when they speak against making war or alliance,
and urge their hearers to remain at peace, this kind
of rhetoric is called dissuasion. A third kind is
employed when a speaker asserts that he is wronged
by some one whom he makes out to have caused
him much mischief; accusation is the name applied
to the kind here defined. The fourth kind of rhetoric
is termed defence; here the speaker shows that he
has done no wrong and that his conduct is in no
respect abnormal; defence is the term applied in
such a case.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94">
    <p rend="merge">A fifth kind of rhetoric is employed
when a speaker speaks well of some one and proves
him to be worthy and honourable; encomium is the
name given to this kind. A sixth kind is that
employed when the speaker shows some one to be unworthy; the name given to this is invective. Under
rhetoric, then, are included encomium, invective,
persuasion, dissuasion, accusation and defence.</p>
<p>Successful speaking has four divisions. The first
consists in speaking to the purpose, the next to the
requisite length, the third before the proper audience,
and the fourth at the proper moment. The things
to the purpose are those which are likely to be
expedient for speaker and hearer. The requisite
length is that which is neither more nor less than
enough.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95">
    <p rend="merge">To speak to the proper audience means
this: in addressing persons older than yourself, the
<pb n='361'/>
discourse must be made suitable to the audience as
being elderly men; whereas in addressing juniors
the discourse must be suitable to young men.
The proper time of speaking is neither too soon nor
too late; otherwise you will miss the mark and not
speak with success.</p>
<p>Of conferring benefits there are four divisions.
For it takes place either by pecuniary aid or by
personal service, by means of knowledge or of speech.
Pecuniary aid is given when one assists a man in
need, so that he is relieved from all anxiety on the
score of money. Personal service is given when men
come up to those who are being beaten and rescue
them.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96">
    <p rend="merge">Those who train or heal, or who teach something valuable, confer benefit by means of knowledge.
But when men enter a law-court and one appears as
advocate for another and delivers an effective speech
on his behalf, he is benefiting him by speech. Thus
benefits are conferred by means either of money or
of personal service, or of knowledge, or of speech.</p>
<p>There are four ways in which things are completed
and brought to an end. The first is by legal enactment, when a decree is passed and this decree is
confirmed by law. The second is in the course of
nature, as the day, the year and the seasons are
completed. The third is by the rules of art, say the
builder's art, for so a house is completed; and so it
is with shipbuilding, whereby vessels are completed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97">
    <p rend="merge">Fourthly, matters are brought to an end by chance
or accident, when they turn out otherwise than is
expected. Thus the completion of things is due
either to law, or to nature, or to art, or to chance.</p>
<p>Of power or ability there are four divisions. First,
whatever we can do with the mind, namely calculate
<pb n='363'/>
or anticipate; next, whatever we can effect with the
body, for instance, marching, giving, taking and the
like. Thirdly, whatever we can do by a multitude
of soldiers or a plentiful supply of money; hence a
king is said to have great power. The fourth division
of power or influence is doing, or being done by, well
or ill; thus we can become ill or be educated, be
restored to health and the like. Power, then, is
either in the mind, or the body, or in armies and
resources, or in acting and being acted upon.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98">
<p>Philanthropy is of three kinds. One is by way of
salutations, as when certain people address every one
they meet and, stretching out their hand, give him
a hearty greeting; another mode is seen when one
is given to assisting every one in distress; another
mode of philanthropy is that which makes certain
people fond of giving dinners. Thus philanthropy is
shown either by a courteous address, or by conferring
benefits, or by hospitality and the promotion of social
intercourse.</p>
<p>Welfare or happiness includes five parts. One
part of it is good counsel, a second soundness of the
senses and bodily health, a third success in one's
undertakings, a fourth a reputation with one's
fellow-men, a fifth ample means in money and in
whatever else subserves the end of life.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99">
    <p rend="merge">Now deliberating well is a result of education and of having
experience of many things. Soundness of the senses
depends upon the bodily organs: I mean, if one sees
with his eyes, hears with his ears, and perceives
with his nostrils and his mouth the appropriate
objects, then such a condition is soundness of the
senses. Success is attained when a man does what
he aims at in the right way, as becomes a good man.</p>
<pb n='365'/>
<p>A man has a good reputation when he is well spoken
of. A man has ample means when he is so equipped
for the needs of life that he can afford to benefit his
friends and discharge his public services with lavish
display. If a man has all these things, he is completely happy. Thus of welfare or happiness one
part is good counsel, another soundness of senses
and bodily health, a third success, a fourth a good
reputation, a fifth ample means.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100">
<p>There are three divisions of the arts and crafts.
The first division consists of mining and forestry,
which are productive arts. The second includes
the smith's and carpenter's arts which transform
material; for the smith makes weapons out of iron,
and the carpenter transforms timber into flutes and
lyres. The third division is that which uses what is
thus made, as horsemanship employs bridles, the art
of war employs weapons, and music flutes and the
lyre. Thus of art there are three several species,
those above-mentioned in the first, second and third
place.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101">
<p>Good is divided into four kinds. One is the possessor of virtue, whom we affirm to be individually
good. Another is virtue itself and justice; these
we affirm to be good. A third includes such things
as food, suitable exercises and drugs. The fourth
kind which we affirm to be good includes the arts of
flute-playing, acting and the like. Thus there are
four kinds of good: the possession of virtue; virtue
itself; thirdly, food and beneficial exercises; lastly,
flute-playing, acting, and the poetic art.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102">
    <p rend="merge">Whatever
is is either evil or good or indifferent. We call that
evil which is capable of invariably doing harm; for
<pb n='367'/>
instance, bad judgement and folly and injustice and
the like. The contraries of these things are good.
But the things which can sometimes benefit and
sometimes harm, such as walking and sitting and
eating, or which can neither do any benefit nor
harm at all, these are things indifferent, neither
good nor evil. Thus all things whatever are either
good, or evil, or neither good nor evil.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103">
<p>Good order in the state falls under three heads.
First, if the laws are good, we say that there is good
government. Secondly, if the citizens obey the
established laws, we also call this good government.
Thirdly, if, without the aid of laws, the people
manage their affairs well under the guidance of
customs and institutions, we call this again good
government. Thus three forms of good government may exist, (1) when the laws are good, (2) when
the existing laws are obeyed, (3) when the people
live under salutary customs and institutions.</p>
<p>Disorder in a state has three forms. The first
arises when the laws affecting citizens and strangers
are alike bad,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104">
    <p rend="merge">the second when the existing laws are
not obeyed, and the third when there is no law at
all. Thus the state is badly governed when the laws
are bad or not obeyed, or lastly, when there is no law.</p>
<p>Contraries are divided into three species. For
instance, we say that goods are contrary to evils, as
justice to injustice, wisdom to folly, and the like.
Again, evils are contrary to evils, prodigality is
contrary to niggardliness, and to be unjustly tortured
is the contrary of being justly tortured, and so with
similar evils. Again, heavy is the contrary of light,
<pb n='369'/>
quick of slow, black of white, and these pairs are
contraries, while they are neither good nor evil.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105">
    <p rend="merge">Thus,
of contraries, some are opposed as goods to evils,
others as evils to evils, and others, as things which are
neither good nor evil, are opposed to one another.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of goods, those which can
be exclusively possessed, those which can be shared
with others, and those which simply exist. To the
first division, namely, those which can be exclusively
possessed, belong such things as justice and health.
To the next belong all those which, though they
cannot be exclusively possessed, can be shared with
others. Thus we cannot possess the absolute good,
but we can participate in it. The third division
includes those goods the existence of which is

<p>Counsel is divided under three heads. One is
taken from past time, one from the future, and the
third from the present. That from past time consists of examples; for instance, what the Lacedaemonians suffered through trusting others. Counsel
drawn from the present is to show, for instance, that
the walls are weak, the men cowards, and the
supplies running short. Counsel from the future is.
for instance, to urge that we should not wrong the
embassies by suspicions, lest the fair fame of Hellas
be stained. Thus counsel is derived from the past,
the present and the future.</p></div>

<p>Vocal sound falls into two divisions according as it
is animate or inanimate. The voice of living things
is animate sound; notes of instruments and noises
are inanimate. And of the animate voice part is
articulate, part inarticulate, that of men being
articulate speech, that of the animals inarticulate.
Thus vocal sound is either animate or inanimate.</p>
<p>Whatever exists is either divisible or indivisible.
Of divisible things some are divisible into similar
and others into dissimilar parts. Those things are
indivisible which cannot be divided and are not
compounded of elements, for example, the unit,
the point and the musical note; whereas those which
have constituent parts, for instance, syllables, concords in music, animals, water, gold, are divisible.</p></div>

whole does not differ from the part except in bulk,
as water, gold and all that is fusible, and the like,
then they are termed homogeneous. But whatever
is composed of dissimilar parts, as a house and the
like, is termed heterogeneous. Thus all things whatever are either divisible or indivisible, and of those
which are divisible some are homogeneous, others
heterogeneous in their parts.</p>
<p>Of existing things some are absolute and some are
called relative. Things said to exist absolutely are
those which need nothing else to explain them, as
man, horse, and all other animals.</p></div>

quicker is quicker than something. Thus existing

things are either absolute or relative. And in this
way, according to Aristotle, Plato used to divide the

<p>The foregoing is the best account of Plato that we
were able to compile after a diligent examination of
the authorities. He was succeeded by Speusippus,
an Athenian and son of Eurymedon, who belonged
to the deme of Myrrhinus, and was the son of Plato's
sister Potone. He was head of the school for eight
years beginning in the 108th Olympiad.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">348-344 b.c.</note>
He set
up statues of the Graces in the shrine of the Muses
erected by Plato in the Academy. He adhered
faithfully to Plato's doctrines. In character, however,
he was unlike him, being prone to anger and easily
overcome by pleasures. At any rate there is a story
that in a fit of passion he flung his favourite dog
into the well, and that pleasure was the sole motive
for his journey to Macedonia to be present at the
wedding-feast of Casander.</p></div>

<head>Chapter 2. XENOCRATES (396-314 B.C.)
(Head of the Academy 339-314 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Xenocrates, the son of Agathenor, was a native of Chalcedon. He was a pupil of Plato from his
                                earliest youth; moreover he accompanied him on his journey to
                                Sicily. He was naturally slow and clumsy. Hence Plato, comparing him
                                to Aristotle, said, <q>The one needed a spur, the other a
                                bridle.</q> And again, <q>See what an ass I am training and what a
                                horse he has to run against.</q> However, Xenocrates was in all besides
                                dignified and grave of demeanour, which made Plato say to him
                                continually, <q>Xenocrates, sacrifice to the Graces.</q> He spent
                                most of his time in the Academy; and whenever he was going to betake
                                himself to the city, it is said that all the noisy rabble and hired
                                porters made way for him as he passed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
    <p rend="merge">And that once the notorious Phryne
tried to make his acquaintance and, as if she were
being chased by some people, took refuge under his
roof; that he admitted her out of ordinary humanity
and, there being but one small couch in the room,
permitted her to share it with him, and at last, after
<pb n='383'/>
many importunities, she retired without success,
telling those who inquired that he whom she quitted
was not a man but a statue. Another version of the
story is that his pupils induced Laïs to invade his
couch; and that so great was his endurance that he
many times submitted to amputation and cautery.
His words were entirely worthy of credit, so much
so that, although it was illegal for witnesses to give
evidence unsworn, the Athenians allowed Xenocrates
alone to do so.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
    <p rend="merge">Furthermore, he was extremely
independent; at all events, when Alexander sent
him a large sum of money, he took three thousand
Attic drachmas and sent back the rest to Alexander,
whose needs, he said, were greater than his own,
because he had a greater number of people to keep.
Again, he would not accept the present sent him by
Antipater, as Myronianus attests in his
<hi rend='ital'>Parallels.</hi>
And when he had been honoured at the court of
Dionysius with a golden crown as the prize for his
prowess in drinking at the Feast of Pitchers, he went
out and placed it on the statue of Hermes just as
he had been accustomed to place there garlands of
flowers. There is a story that, when he was sent,
along with others also, on an embassy to Philip, his
colleagues, being bribed, accepted Philip's invitations to feasts and talked with him. Xenocrates
did neither the one nor the other. Indeed on this
account Philip declined to see him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
    <p rend="merge">Hence, when the envoys returned to Athens, they complained that Xenocrates had
                                accompanied them without rendering any service. Thereupon the people
                                were ready to fine him. But when he told them that now more than
                                ever they ought to consider the interests of the state--<q>for,</q>
                                said he, <q>Philip knew <pb n="385"/> that the others had
                                accepted his bribes, but that he would never win me over</q>--then the
                                people paid him double honours. And afterwards Philip said that, of
                                all who had arrived at his court, Xenocrates was the only man whom
                                he could not bribe. Moreover, when he went as envoy to Antipater to
                                plead for Athenians taken prisoners in the Lamian war,<note n="a"
                                    xml:lang="eng">322 b.c.</note> being invited to dine with
                                Antipater, he quoted to him the following lines<note n="b"
                                    xml:lang="eng">Hom. <hi rend="ital">Od.</hi> x.

<p>O Circe! what righteous man would have the heart to
taste meat and drink ere he had redeemed his company and
beheld them face to face?</p>
<p>and so pleased Antipater with his ready wit that he
at once released them.</p></div>

<p>When a little sparrow was pursued by a hawk and rushed into his bosom, he stroked it and let it

                                by Bion, he said he would make no reply. For neither, said he, does
                                tragedy deign to answer the banter of comedy. To some one who had

                                wished to attend his lectures, Xenocrates said, <q>Go your ways,
                                for you offer philosophy nothing to lay hold of.</q> Others report him
                                as saying, <q>It is not to me that you come for the carding of a

                                mine.</q> They say too that, when Antipater came to Athens and greeted
                                him, he did not address him in return until he had finished what he
                                was saying. He was singularly free from pride; more than once <pb

(Head of the Academy from 314 to c. 276 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>Polemo, the son of Philostratus, was an Athenian
who belonged to the deme of Oea. In his youth he
was so profligate and dissipated that he actually
carried about with him money to procure the immediate gratification of his desires, and would even
keep sums concealed in lanes and alleys.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi

Even in
the Academy a piece of three obols was found close
to a pillar, where he had buried it for the same
purpose. And one day, by agreement with his
young friends, he burst into the school of Xenocrates
quite drunk, with a garland on his head. Xenocrates,
however, without being at all disturbed, went on
with his discourse as before, the subject being
temperance. The lad, as he listened, by degrees
was taken in the toils. He became so industrious
<pb n='395'/>
as to surpass all the other scholars, and rose to be
himself head of the school in the 116th Olympiad.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">316-312

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>Antigonus of Carystus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Biographies</hi> says
that
his father was foremost among the citizens and kept
horses to compete in the chariot-race; that Polemo
himself had been defendant in an action brought by
his wife, who charged him with cruelty owing to the
irregularities of his life; but that, from the time
when he began to study philosophy, he acquired
such strength of character as always to maintain the
same unruffled calm of demeanour. Nay more, he
never lost control of his voice. This in fact accounts
for the fascination which he exercised over Crantor.
<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra,</hi> §24.</note>
Certain it is that, when a mad dog bit him in the
back of his thigh, he did not even turn pale, but
remained undisturbed by all the clamour which
arose in the city at the news of what had happened.
In the theatre too he was singularly unmoved.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
    <p rend="merge">For
instance, Nicostratus, who was nicknamed Clytemnestra, was once reading to him and Crates something from Homer; and, while Crates was deeply
affected, he was no more moved than if he had
not heard him. Altogether he was a man such as
Melanthius the painter describes in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On
Painting.</hi> There he says that a certain wilfulness
and stubbornness should be stamped on works of
art, and that the same holds good of character.
Polemo used to say that we should exercise ourselves with facts and not with mere logical speculations, which leave us, like a man who has got by
heart some paltry handbook on harmony but never
practised, able, indeed, to win admiration for skill
in asking questions, but utterly at variance with
ourselves in the ordering of our lives.</p>

<p>He was, then, refined and generous, and would beg to be excused, in the words of Aristophanes

                                love of what is noble that he was honoured in the state.
                                Nevertheless would he withdraw from society <note n="b"

                                while close by his scholars made themselves little huts and lived
                                not far from the shrine of the Muses and the lecture-hall. It would
                                seem that in all respects Polemo emulated Xenocrates. And Aristippus
                                in the fourth book of his work <hi rend="ital">On the Luxury of the
                                    Ancients</hi> affirms him to have been his favourite. Certainly
                                he always kept his predecessor before his mind and, like him, wore
                                that simple austere dignity which is proper to the Dorian mode.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">

<p>Nor must, nor blended vintage, but true Pramnian.</p>
<p>Thus he would call Homer the Sophocles of epic, and
Sophocles the Homer of tragedy</p>
<p>He died at an advanced age of gradual decay,
leaving behind him a considerable number of works.
I have composed the following epigram upon him<note n="d" xml:lang="eng"><hi

<head>Chapter 4. CRATES (of Athens)
(Head of the Academy in third century B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
<p>Crates, whose father was Antigenes, was an
Athenian belonging to the deme of Thria. He was
a pupil and at the same time a favourite of Polemo,
whom he succeeded in the headship of the school.
The two were so much attached to each other that
they not only shared the same pursuits in life but
grew more and more alike to their latest breath, and,
dying, shared the same tomb. Hence Antagoras,
writing of both, employed this figure<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 103.</note>:</p>
<p>Passing stranger, say that in this tomb rest godlike
Crates and Polemo, men magnanimous in concord, from
whose inspired lips flowed sacred speech, and whose pure
life of wisdom, in accordance with unswerving tenets, decked
them for a bright immortality.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
<p>Hence Arcesilaus, who had quitted Theophrastus
and gone over to their school, said of them that they
were gods or a remnant of the Golden Age. They
did not side with the popular party, but were such
as Dionysodorus the flute-player is said to have
claimed to be, when he boasted that no one ever
heard his melodies, as those of Ismenias were heard,
either on shipboard or at the fountain. According
to Antigonus, their common table was in the house
of Crantor; and these two and Arcesilaus lived in
harmony together. Arcesilaus and Crantor shared
the same house, while Polemo and Crates lived with
<pb n='401'/>
Lysicles, one of the citizens. Crates, as already
stated, was the favourite of Polemo and Arcesilaus
of Crantor.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p>According to Apollodorus in the third book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, Crates at his death left behind him
works,
some of a philosophical kind, others on comedy,
others again speeches delivered in the assembly or
when he was envoy. He also left distinguished
pupils; among them Arcesilaus, of whom we shall
speak presently--for he was also a pupil of Crates;
another was Bion of Borysthenes, who was afterwards
known as the Theodorean, from the school which he
joined; of him too we shall have occasion to speak
next after Arcesilaus.</p>
<p>There have been ten men who bore the name of
Crates: (1) the poet of the Old Comedy; (2) a
rhetorician of Tralles, a pupil of Isocrates; (3) a
sapper and miner who accompanied Alexander; (4)
the Cynic, of whom more hereafter; (5) a Peripatetic
philosopher; (6) the Academic philosopher described
above; (7) a grammarian of Malos; (8) the author of
a geometrical work; (9) a composer of epigrams;
(10) an Academic philosopher of Tarsus.</p></div>

<head>Chapter 5. CRANTOR
(Perhaps about 340-290 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
<p>Crantor of Soli, though he was much esteemed in his native country, left it for Athens and
                                attended the lectures of Xenocrates at the same time as Polemo. He
                                left memoirs extending to 30,000 lines, some of which are by some
                                critics attributed to Arcesilaus. He is said to have been asked what
                                it was in Polemo that attracted him, and to have <pb n="403"/>
                                replied, <q>The fact that I never heard him raise or lower his
                                voice in speaking.</q> He happened to fall ill, and retired to the
                                temple of Asclepius, where he proceeded to walk about. At once
                                people flocked round him in the belief that he had retired thither,
                                not on account of illness, but in order to open a school. Among them
                                was Arcesilaus, who wished to be introduced by his means to Polemo,
                                notwithstanding the affection which united the two, as will be
                                related in the Life of Arcesilaus.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
    <p rend="merge">However, when
he recovered, he continued to attend Polemo's
lectures, and for this he was universally praised. He
is also said to have left Arcesilaus his property, to
the value of twelve talents. And when asked by
him where he wished to be buried, he answered<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Nauck,

<hi

<p><hi rend='center'>Sweet in some nook of native soil to

<p>It is also said that he wrote poems and deposited
them under seal in the temple of Athena in his
native place. And Theaetetus the poet writes thus
of him<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> ii. 28.</note>:</p>
<p>Pleasing to men, more pleasing to the Muses, lived Crantor,
and never saw old age. Receive, O earth, the hallowed

below.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p>Crantor admired Homer and Euripides above all
other poets; it is hard, he said, at once to write
tragedy and to stir the emotions in the language of
everyday life. And he would quote the line from
the story of Bellerophon<note n="c" xml:lang="eng">Nauck,

<p>And it is said that there are extant<note n="d" xml:lang="eng"><hi

poet Antagoras, spoken by Crantor on Love:
<pb n='405'/>
My mind is in doubt, since thy birth is disputed, whether
I am to call thee, Love, the first of the immortal gods, the
eldest of all the children whom old Erebus and queenly
Night brought to birth in the depths beneath wide Ocean;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">

Winds? So many are the goods and ills thou devisest for
men in thy wanderings. Therefore hast thou a body of

<p>He was also clever at inventing terms. For instance, he said of a tragic player's voice that it
                                was unpolished and unpeeled. And of a certain poet that his verses
                                abounded in miserliness. And that the disquisitions of Theophrastus
                                were written with an oyster-shell. His most highly esteemed work is

<head>Chapter 6. ARCESILAUS (c. 318-242 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
<p>Arcesilaus, the son of Seuthes, according to Apollodorus in the third book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, came
from
Pitane in Aeolis. With him begins the Middle
Academy; he was the first to suspend his judgement
owing to the contradictions of opposing arguments.
He was also the first to argue on both sides of a
question, and the first to meddle with the system
handed down by Plato and, by means of question
and answer, to make it more closely resemble eristic.</p>
<pb n='407'/>
<p>He came across Crantor in this way. He was the
youngest of four brothers, two of them being his
brothers by the same father, and two by the same
mother. Of the last two Pylades was the elder, and
of the former two Moereas, and Moereas was his
guardian.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
    <p rend="merge">At first, before he left Pitane for Athens,
he was a pupil of the mathematician Autolycus, his
fellow-countryman, and with him he also travelled
to Sardis. Next he studied under Xanthus, the
musician, of Athens; then he was a pupil of Theophrastus. Lastly, he crossed over to the Academy
and joined Crantor. For while his brother Moereas,
who has already been mentioned, wanted to make
him a rhetorician, he was himself devoted to philosophy, and Crantor, being enamoured of him, cited
the line from the
<hi rend='ital'>Andromeda</hi> of Euripides<note

<p>After that they lived together. Whereupon Theophrastus, nettled at his loss, is said to have
                                remarked, <q>What a quick-witted and ready pupil has left my
                                school!</q> For, besides being most effective in argument and decidedly
                                fond of writing books, he also took up poetry. And there is extant
                                an epigram of his upon Attalus which runs thus<note n="c"

<p>He esteemed Homer above all the poets and would
always read a passage from him before going to
sleep. And in the morning he would say, whenever
he wanted to read Homer, that he would pay a visit
to his dear love. Pindar too he declared matchless
for imparting fullness of diction and for affording a
copious store of words and phrases. And in his youth
he made a special study of Ion.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<p>He also attended the lectures of the geometer Hipponicus, at whom he pointed a jest as one who
                                was in all besides a listless, yawning sluggard but yet proficient
                                in his subject. <q>Geometry,</q> he said, <q>must have flown into

                                completely restored. He took over the school on the death of Crates,
                                a certain Socratides having retired in his favour. According to
                                some, one result of his suspending judgement on all matters was that
                                he never so much as wrote a book.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">If this

                                according to others he burnt. He would seem to have held Plato in

He was devoted to dialectic and adopted the methods

<p>And a little farther on he introduces him as saying:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>I shall swim to Pyrrho and to crooked

<p>He was highly axiomatic and concise, and in his discourse fond of distinguishing the meaning of terms.
He was satirical enough, and outspoken.</p></div>

<p>A certain dialectic, a follower of Alexinus, was unable to repeat properly some argument of his

                                Philoxenus and the brickmakers. He found them singing some of his
                                melodies out of tune; so he retaliated by trampling on the bricks

<p>Very fertile in invention, he could meet objection acutely or bring the course of discussion back
                                to the point at issue, and fit it to every occasion. In
                                persuasiveness he had no equal, and this all the more drew pupils to

                                they willingly put up with that; for his goodness was extraordinary,

                                most modestly anxious to conceal the favour. For instance, he once
                                called upon Ctesibius when he was ill and, seeing in what straits he
                                was, quietly put a purse under his pillow. He, when he found it,
                                said, <q>This is the joke of Arcesilaus.</q> Moreover, on another

<p>Again, by introducing Archias the Arcadian to
Eumenes, he caused him to be advanced to great
dignity. And, as he was very liberal, caring very
little for money, so he was the first to attend performances where seats were paid for, and he was above all
eager to go to those of Archecrates and Callicrates, for
which the fee was a gold piece. And he helped many
people and collected subscriptions for them. Some one
once borrowed his silver plate in order to entertain
friends and never brought it back, but Arcesilaus did
not ask him for it and pretended it had not been
borrowed. Another version of the story is that he lent
it on purpose, and, when it was returned, made the
borrower a present of it because he was poor. He
had property in Pitane from which his brother
Pylades sent him supplies. Furthermore, Eumenes,
<pb n='417'/>
the son of Philetaerus, furnished him with large sums,

the contemporary kings to whom he dedicated any
of his works.</p></div>

<p>And whereas many persons courted Antigonus and
went to meet him whenever he came to Athens,
Arcesilaus remained at home, not wishing to thrust
himself upon his acquaintance. He was on the best
of terms with Hierocles, the commandant in Munichia
and Piraeus, and at every festival would go down to
see him. And though Hierocles joined in urging
him to pay his respects to Antigonus, he was not
prevailed upon, but, after going as far as the gates,
turned back. And after the battle at sea,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">The reference may

many went to Antigonus or wrote him flattering

Antigonus, but failed in his mission. He spent his

with those who shared his tastes. He lived openly
with Theodete and Phila, the Elean courtesans, and
to those who censured him he quoted the maxims of
Aristippus. He was also fond of boys and very
susceptible. Hence he was accused by Ariston of

told them that for his part he was willing to admit
them but that Cleochares would not let him. This
same youth had amongst his admirers Demochares
the son of Laches, and Pythocles the son of Bugelus,
and once when Arcesilaus had caught them, with
great forbearance he ordered them off. For all this
he was assailed and ridiculed by the critics abovementioned, as a friend of the mob who courted
popularity. The most virulent attacks were made
upon him in the circle of Hieronymus the Peripatetic,<note

recommend his pupils to hear other philosophers.
And when a certain youth from Chios was not well

<p>Another pleasant story told of him is this. Some one had inquired why it was that pupils from all

<p>At last, being near his end, he left all his property
to his brother Pylades, because, unknown to Moereas,
he had taken him to Chios and thence brought him
to Athens. In all his life he never married nor had
any children. He made three wills: the first he
left at Eretria in the charge of Amphicritus, the
second at Athens in the charge of certain friends,
while the third he dispatched to his home to
Thaumasias, one of his relatives, with the request
that he would keep it safe. To this man he also

<p>he, knowing that he had already been maligned to the king, replied, <q>My father was a

                                arrogance. He left very many memoirs, and also sayings of useful
                                application. For example, when he was reproached for not paying
                                court to a youth, his excuse was, <q>You can't get hold of a soft

who used every kind of sophistical argument. And
after Theodorus he attended the lectures of Theophrastus the Peripatetic. He was fond of display
and great at cutting up anything with a jest, using
vulgar names for things. Because he employed every
style of speech in combination, Eratosthenes, we

philosophy with bright-flowered robes. He was
clever also at parody. Here is a specimen of his

<head>Chapter 8. LACYDES
(Head of the Academy c. 242-216 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59">
<p>Lacydes, son of Alexander, was a native of Cyrene
He was the founder of the New Academy and the
successor of Arcesilaus: a man of very serious
character who found numerous admirers; industrious
from his youth up and, though poor, of pleasant
manners and pleasant conversation. A most amusing
story is told of his housekeeping. Whenever he
brought anything out of the store-room, he would
seal the door up again and throw his signet-ring
inside through the opening, to ensure that nothing
laid up there should be stolen or carried off. So
soon, then, as his rogues of servants got to know this,
they broke the seal and carried off what they pleased,
afterwards throwing the ring in the same way through
<pb n='437'/>
the opening into the store-room. Nor were they ever
detected in this.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60">
<p>Lacydes used to lecture in the Academy, in the garden which had been laid out by King Attalus,
                                and from him it derived its name of Lacydeum. He did what none of
                                his predecessors had ever done; in his lifetime he handed over the
                                school to Telecles and Evander, both of Phocaea. Evander was
                                succeeded by Hegesinus of Pergamum, and he again by Carneades. A
                                good saying is attributed to Lacydes. When Attalus sent for him, he
                                is said to have remarked that statues are best seen from a distance.
                                He stadied geometry late, and some one said to him, <q>Is this a
                                proper time?</q> To which he replied, <q>Nay, is it not even yet the

<p>Of thee too, O Lacydes, I have heard a tale, that Bacchus seized thee and dragged thee on

                                underworld. Nay, was it not clear that when the wine-god comes in
                                force into the frame, he loosens our limbs? Perhaps this is why he

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62">
<p>Carneades, the son of Epicomus or (according

carefully the writings of the Stoics and particularly

<p><hi rend='center'>Without Chrysippus where should I have

<p>The man's industry was unparalleled, although in
physics he was not so strong as in ethics. Hence he
would let his hair and nails grow long from intense
devotion to study. Such was his predominance in
philosophy that even the rhetoricians would dismiss
their classes and repair to him to hear him lecture.</p></div>

<p>His voice was extremely powerful, so that the keeper of the gymnasium sent to him and requested

                                something by which to regulate my voice.</q> Thereupon by a happy hit
                                the man replied in the words, <q>You have a regulator in your

                                he was a formidable controversialist. And for the reasons already

                                was Mentor the Bithynian, who tried to ingratiate himself with a
                                concubine of Carneades; so on one occasion (according to Favorinus
                                in his <hi rend="ital">Miscellaneous History</hi>), when Mentor came
                                to lecture, Carneades in the course of his remarks let fall these
                                lines by way of parody at his expense:</p></div>

                                exclaimed, <q>Give it then to me also.</q> And when those about him

<p>It is said that his eyes went blind at night without <pb n="443"/> his knowing it, and he ordered

(Head of the Academy from 129 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67">
<p>Clitomachus was a Carthaginian, his real name
being Hasdrubal, and he taught philosophy at
Carthage in his native tongue. He had reached his
fortieth year when he went to Athens and became
a pupil of Carneades. And Carneades, recognizing
his industry, caused him to be educated and took
part in training him. And to such lengths did his
diligence go that he composed more than four
hundred treatises. He succeeded Carneades in the
headship of the school, and by his writings did much
to elucidate his opinions. He was eminently well
acquainted with the three sects--the Academy, the
Peripatetics, and the Stoics.</p>
<p>The Academics in general are assailed by Timon
in the line:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>The prolixity of the Academics unseasoned by

<p>Having thus reviewed the Academics who derived
from Plato, we will now pass on to the Peripatetics, who
also derived from Plato. They begin with Aristotle.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>Aristotle, son of Nicomachus and Phaestis, was
a native of Stagira. His father, Nicomachus, as
Hermippus relates in his book
<hi rend='ital'>On Aristotle</hi>, traced
his descent from Nicomachus who was the son of
Machaon and grandson of Asclepius; and he resided
with Amyntas, the king of Macedon, in the capacity
of physician and friend. Aristotle was Plato's most
genuine disciple; he spoke with a lisp, as we learn
from Timotheus the Athenian in his book
<hi rend='ital'>On Lives</hi>;
further, his calves were slender (so they say), his
eyes small, and he was conspicuous by his attire, his
rings, and the cut of his hair. According to
Timaeus, he had a son by Herpyllis, his concubine,
who was also called Nicomachus.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>He seceded from the Academy while Plato was still alive. Hence the remark attributed to the
                                latter: <q>Aristotle spurns me, as colts kick out at the mother

                                    <hi rend="ital">Lives</hi> mentions that he was absent as
                                Athenian envoy at the court of Philip when Xenocrates became head of
                                the Academy, and that on his return, when he saw the school under a
                                new head, he made choice of a public walk in the Lyceum where he
                                would walk <pb n="447"/> up and down discussing philosophy with his
                                pupils until it was time to rub themselves with oil. Hence the name
                                <q>Peripatetic.</q> But others say that it was given to him because,
                                when Alexander was recovering from an illness and taking daily
                                walks, Aristotle joined him and talked with him on certain
                                matters.</p></div>

<p>He also taught his pupils to discourse upon a set
theme, besides practising them in oratory. Afterwards, however, he departed to Hermias the eunuch,
who was tyrant of Atarneus, and there is one story
that he was on very affectionate terms with Hermias;
according to another, Hermias bound him by ties of
kinship, giving him his daughter or his niece in
marriage, and so Demetrius of Magnesia narrates in
his work on
<hi rend='ital'>Poets and Writers of the Same Name.</hi>
The
same author tells us that Hermias had been the slave
of Eubulus, and that he was of Bithynian origin and
had murdered his master. Aristippus in his first
book
<hi rend='ital'>On the Luxury of the Ancients</hi> says that
Aristotle
fell in love with a concubine of Hermias,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">

in honour of Hermias, which is given below; next that
he stayed in Macedonia at Philip's court and received
from him his son Alexander as his pupil; that he
petitioned Alexander to restore his native city which
had been destroyed by Philip and obtained his
<pb n='449'/>
request; and that he also drew up a code of laws for
the inhabitants. We learn further that, following the
example of Xenocrates, he made it a rule in his
school that every ten days a new president should be
appointed. When he thought that he had stayed
long enough with Alexander, he departed to Athens,
having first presented to Alexander his kinsman
Callisthenes of Olynthus.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
    <p rend="merge">But when Callisthenes
talked with too much freedom to the king and disregarded his own advice, Aristotle is said to have
rebuked him by citing the line<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Hom.

of complicity in the plot of Hermolaus against the
life of Alexander, was confined in an iron cage and
carried about until he became infested with vermin
through lack of proper attention; and finally he was
thrown to a lion and so met his end.</p>
<p>To return to Aristotle: he came to Athens, was
head of his school for thirteen years, and then
withdrew to Chalcis because he was indicted for
impiety by Eurymedon the hierophant, or, according to Favorinus<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">As in ii. 78, iii. 19 and v. 77, Favorinus

<p>At Chalcis he died, according to Eumelus in the

aconite, at the
age of seventy. The same authority makes him
thirty years old when he came to Plato; but here he
is mistaken. For Aristotle lived to be sixty-three,
and he was seventeen when he became Plato's pupil.</p>
<p>The hymn in question runs as follows:</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>O virtue, toilsome for the generation of mortals to achieve,
the fairest prize that life can win, for thy beauty, O virgin,
it were a doom glorious in Hellas even to die and to endure

in the mind, imperishable, better than gold, dearer than
parents or soft-eyed sleep. For thy sake Heracles, son

him immortal, exalting the majesty of Zeus, guardian of
strangers, and the grace of lasting friendship.</p>
<p>There is, too, something of my own upon the

up she shall be given in marriage to Nicanor; but
if anything happen to the girl (which heaven forbid
and no such thing will happen) before her marriage,
or when she is married but before there are children,
Nicanor shall have full powers, both with regard to
the child and with regard to everything else, to

of us. Nicanor shall take charge of the girl and of
the boy Nicomachus as he shall think fit in all that
concerns them as if he were father and brother.
And if anything should happen to Nicanor (which
heaven forbid!) either before he marries the girl, or

                                    suspicion, because they see in it a resemblance to the last

                                    Accordingly they are disposed to doubt the genuineness of the

a very large number of dishes belonging to him were
found, and that Lyco mentioned his bathing in a
bath of warm oil and then selling the oil. Some
relate that he placed a skin of warm oil on his
stomach, and that, when he went to sleep, a bronze
ball was placed in his hand with a vessel under it,

<p>Such is the number of the works written by him.
And in them he puts forward the following views.
There are two divisions of philosophy, the practical
and the theoretical. The practical part includes
ethics and politics, and in the latter not only the
doctrine of the state but also that of the household
is sketched. The theoretical part includes physics
and logic, although logic is not an independent
science, but is elaborated as an instrument to the
rest of science. And he clearly laid down that it
has a twofold aim, probability and truth. For each
of these he employed two faculties, dialectic and
rhetoric where probability is aimed at, analytic and
<pb n='477'/>
philosophy where the end is truth; he neglects
nothing which makes either for discovery or for
judgement or for utility.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
    <p rend="merge">As making for discovery
he left in the
<hi rend='ital'>Topics</hi> and
<hi
rend='ital'>Methodics</hi> a number of
propositions, whereby the student can be well supplied with probable arguments for the solution of
problems. As an aid to judgement he left the
<hi rend='ital'>Prior</hi>
and
<hi rend='ital'>Posterior Analytics.</hi> By the Prior Analytics
the
premisses are judged, by the Posterior the process of
inference is tested. For practical use there are the
precepts on controversy and the works dealing with
question and answer, with sophistical fallacies,
syllogisms and the like. The test of truth which he
put forward was sensation in the sphere of objects
actually presented, but in the sphere of morals
dealing with the state, the household and the laws,
it was reason.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
<p>The one ethical end he held to be the exercise
of virtue in a completed life. And happiness he
maintained to be made up of goods of three sorts:
goods of the soul, which indeed he designates as
of the highest value; in the second place bodily
goods, health and strength, beauty and the like;
and thirdly external goods, such as wealth, good
birth, reputation and the like. And he regarded
virtue as not of itself sufficient to ensure happiness;
bodily goods and external goods were also necessary,
for the wise man would be miserable if he lived in
the midst of pains, poverty, and similar circumstances.
Vice, however, is sufficient in itself to secure misery,
even if it be ever so abundantly furnished with
corporeal and external goods.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
    <p rend="merge">He held that the
virtues are not mutually interdependent. For a man
might be prudent, or again just, and at the same
<pb n='479'/>
time profligate and unable to control his passions.
He said too that the wise man was not exempt from
all passions, but indulged them in moderation.</p>
<p>He defined friendship as an equality of reciprocal
good-will, including under the term as one species
the friendship of kinsmen, as another that of lovers,
and as a third that of host and guest.
<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> iii. 81. and Aristotle,
<hi rend='ital'>Rhet.</hi>
ii. 4 § 28, 1381 b 33</note>
The end of love was not merely intercourse but also philosophy.
According to him the wise man would fall in love
and take part in politics; furthermore he would
marry and reside at a king's court. Of three kinds
of life, the contemplative, the practical, and the
pleasure-loving life, he gave the preference to the
contemplative. He held that the studies which make
up the ordinary education are of service for the
attainment of virtue.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<p>In the sphere of natural science he surpassed all
other philosophers in the investigation of causes, so
that even the most insignificant phenomena were
explained by him. Hence the unusual number of
scientific notebooks which he compiled. Like Plato
he held that God was incorporeal; that his providence extended to the heavenly bodies, that he is
unmoved, and that earthly events are regulated by
their affinity with them (the heavenly bodies).
Besides the four elements he held that there is a
fifth, of which the celestial bodies are composed.
Its motion is of a different kind from that of the
other elements, being circular. Further, he maintained the soul to be incorporeal, defining it as the
first entelechy [<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> realization] of a natural
organic
body potentially possessed of life.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>De
anima,</hi> ii. 1, 412 a 27.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
    <p rend="merge">By the term
realization he means that which has an incorporeal
form. This realization, according to him, is twofold.</p>
<pb n='481'/>
<p>Either it is potential, as that of Hermes in the wax, provided the wax be adapted to receive the
                                proper mouldings, or as that of the statue implicit in the bronze;
                                or again it is determinate, which is the case with the completed
                                figure of Hermes or the finished statue. The soul is the realization
                                <q>of a natural body,</q> since bodies may be divided into (a)
                                artificial bodies made by the hands of craftsmen, as a tower or a
                                ship, and (b) natural bodies which are the work of nature, such as
                                plants and the bodies of animals. And when he said <q>organic</q> he
                                meant constructed as means to an end, as sight is adapted for seeing
                                and the ear for hearing. Of a body <q>potentially possessed of
                                life,</q> that is, in itself.</p></div>

                                said to have soul, in the former he who is asleep. It was then in
                                order to include the sleeper that Aristotle added the word
                                <q>potential.</q></p>

subjects which it would be tedious to enumerate.

<p>Theophrastus was a native of Eresus, the son of
Melantes, a fuller, as stated by Athenodorus in the
eighth book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Walks.</hi> He first heard his
countryman Alcippus lecture in his native town and afterwards he heard Plato, whom he left for Aristotle.
And when the latter withdrew to Chalcis he took
over the school himself in the 114th Olympiad.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">323

A slave of his named Pompylus is also said to have
been a philosopher, according to Myronianus of
Amastris in the first book of his

Theophrastus was a man of remarkable intelligence
and industry and, as Pamphila says in the thirtysecond book of her
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, he taught Menander
the comic poet.</p></div>

                                certainly granted him audience and Ptolemy made overtures to him.
                                And so highly was he valued at Athens that, when Agnonides ventured
                                to prosecute him for impiety, the prosecutor himself narrowly
                                escaped punishment. About 2000 pupils used to attend his lectures.

                                topics, he speaks of a tribunal as follows<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"

                                    as we have just been informed, sometimes numbered 2000. It is

<p>Although his reputation stood so high, nevertheless
for a short time he had to leave the country with all
the other philosophers, when Sophocles the son of
Amphiclides proposed a law that no philosopher
should preside over a school except by permission
of the Senate and the people, under penalty of death.
The next year, however, the philosophers returned,
as Philo had prosecuted Sophocles for making an
illegal proposal. Whereupon the Athenians repealed
the law, fined Sophocles five talents, and voted the
recall of the philosophers, in order that Theophrastus
also might return and live there as before. He bore
the name of Tyrtamus, and it was Aristotle who
re-named him Theophrastus on account of his
graceful style.</p></div>

    <p rend="merge">And Aristippus, in his fourth book <hi rend="ital">On the Luxury of the
                                    Ancients</hi>, asserts that he was enamoured of Aristotle's son
                                Nicomachus, although he was his teacher. It is said that Aristotle
                                applied to him and Callisthenes what Plato had said of Xenocrates
                                and himself (as already related), namely, that the one needed a
                                bridle and the other a goad; for Theophrastus interpreted all his
                                meaning with <pb n="487"/> an excess of cleverness, whereas the
                                other was naturally backward. He is said to have become the owner of
                                a garden of his own after Aristotle's death, through the
                                intervention of his friend Demetrius of Phalerum. There are pithy
                                sayings of his in circulation as follows: <q>An unbridled horse,</q>
                                he said, <q>ought to be trusted sooner than a badly-arranged

                                folly.</q> He used constantly to say that in our expenditure the item

he had relinquished his labours. My verses upon
him are these<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal</hi> vii.

                                of limb, but when released from toil his limbs failed him and he
                                died.</p>
<p>It is said that his disciples asked him if he had any last message for them, to which he replied:
                                <q>Nothing else but this, that many of the pleasures which life
                                boasts are but in the seeming.</q></p></div>

<p>With these words, they say, he breathed his last.

(3) a physician, a disciple, or, as some say, a fosterchild, of Erasistratus; (4) a historian, who treated
of the struggle of Philip and Perseus against the
Romans; (5) * *; (6) a poet who wrote epigrams;
(7) a physician who lived in ancient times, mentioned
by Aristotle; (8) a Peripatetic philosopher who lived

would be well if the others would co-operate with him.
I also give and bequeath to him all my books, except
those of which I am the author, and all the furniture
in the dining-hall, the cushions and the drinking-cups.
The trustees shall give Epicrates 500 drachmas and
one of the servants whom Arcesilaus shall approve.</q></p></div>

the executors shall give him 500 drachmas in money
and one of the servants whom Arcesilaus shall

shared with me and all the services he has rendered

<p>Such are the terms of his extant will, according to the Collection of Ariston of Ceos. Strato
                                himself, however, was, as stated above, a man entitled to full

                                    taken as Diogenes Laertius's defence for his inclusion of the
                                    Life of Strato. According to the scheme of i. 14, 15, the
                                    Peripatetics ended with Theophrastus, whose successors were
                                    often held to be vastly inferior, and unworthy to rank beside
                                    him; see Cicero, <hi rend="ital">De Fin.</hi>v. §§ 12, 13;
                                    Strabo xiii. 609. The latter alleges as the reason for this
                                    decline the well-known story that the school was deprived of
                                    Aristotle's library, which had been carried away to
                                    Scepsis.</note> since he excelled in every branch of learning,
                                and most of all in that which is styled <pb n="519"/>
                                <q>physics,</q> a branch of philosophy more ancient and important

<head>Chapter 4. LYCO (299-225 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65">
<p>Strato's successor was Lyco, the son of Astyanax of Troas, a master of expression and of the
                                foremost rank in the education of boys. For he used to say that
                                modesty and love of honour were as necessary an equipment for boys
                                as spur and bridle for horses. His eloquence and sonorousness of
                                diction appear from the following fact; he speaks of a penniless
                                maiden as follows: <q>A grievous burden to a father is a girl,
                                when for lack of a dowry she runs past the flower of her age.</q> Hence
                                the remark which Antigonus is said to have made about him, that it
                                was not possible to transfer elsewhere the fragrance and charm of
                                the apple, but each separate expression must be contemplated in the
                                speaker himself as every single apple is on the tree.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66">
    <p rend="merge">This was because Lyco's voice was exceedingly sweet, so that some persons
                                altered his name to Glyco, by prefixing a G. But in writing he fell
                                off sadly. For instance, those who regretted their neglect to learn
                                when they had the opportunity and wished they had done so he would
                                hit off neatly as follows, remarking that <q>they were their own
                                accusers, betraying, by vain regret, repentance for an incorrigible
                                laziness.</q> Those who deliberated wrongly he used to say were out in
                                their calculations, as if they had used a crooked rule to test
                                something straight, or looked at the reflection of a face in
                                troubled water or a distorting mirror. Again, <q>Many go in
                                search of the garland of the market-place; few or none seek <pb
                                    n="521"/> the crown at Olympia.</q> He often gave the Athenians
                                advice on various subjects and thus conferred on them the greatest
                                benefits.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67">
<p>In his dress he was most immaculate, so that the
clothes he wore were unsurpassed for the softness
of the material, according to Hermippus. Furthermore, he was well practised in gymnastics and kept
himself in condition, displaying all an athlete's habit
of body, with battered ears and skin begrimed with
oil, so we are told by Antigonus of Carystus. Hence
it is said that he not only wrestled but played the
game of ball common in his birthplace of Ilium. He
was esteemed beyond all other philosophers by
Eumenes and Attalus, who also did him very great
service. Antiochus too tried to get hold of him, but
without success.</p></div>

                                purchase, as well as all the cost of my funeral and the other

and at Aegina I give to Lyco because he bears the

to such of my friends as choose to make use of it,
to Bulo, Callinus, Ariston, Amphion, Lyco, Pytho,
Aristomachus, Heracleus, Lycomedes, and my nephew
Lyco. They shall put over it any such person as
in their opinion will persevere in the work of the
school and will be most capable of extending it.
And all my other friends should co-operate for love
of me and of the spot. Bulo and Callinus, together
with their colleagues, shall provide for my funeral

and shall choose a convenient site where it shall
be erected, with the assistance of Diophantus and
Heraclides the son of Demetrius. From my property
in town Lyco shall repay all from whom I have
<pb n='525'/>

a pair of Rhodian vessels, a smooth carpet, a rug with
nap on both sides, a sofa cover and two cushions the
best that are left, that, so far as I have the means
of recompensing them, I may prove not ungrateful.
With regard to the servants who have waited upon
me, my wishes are as follows. To Demetrius I
remit the purchase-money for the freedom which he
has long enjoyed, and bequeath to him five minas
and a suit of clothes to ensure him a decent maintenance, in return for all the toil he has borne with me.
To Crito of Chalcedon I also remit the purchasemoney for his freedom and bequeath to him four

<p>Demetrius, the son of Phanostratus, was a native
of Phalerum. He was a pupil of Theophrastus, but
by his speeches in the Athenian assembly he held
the chief power in the State for ten years and was
decreed 360 bronze statues, most of them representing him either on horseback or else driving a chariot
or a pair of horses. And these statues were completed in less than 300 days, so much was he
esteemed. He entered politics, says Demetrius of
Magnesia in his work on
<hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name,</hi>
<pb n='529'/>
when Harpalus, fleeing from Alexander,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">324 b.c.</note>

                                Favorinus alleges that he suffered violence from Cleon, while
                                Didymus in his <hi rend="ital">Table-talk</hi> relates how a certain

                                of the Graces</q>), and Lampito (<q>of shining eyes</q>). He is said to
                                have lost his sight when in Alexandria and to have recovered it by
                                the gift of Sarapis; whereupon he composed the paeans which are sung
                                to this day.</p>

<p>Hermippus tells us that upon the death of Casander,

There he spent a considerable time and advised
Ptolemy, among other things, to invest with sovereign power his children by Eurydice. To this
Ptolemy would not agree, but bestowed the diadem
on his son by Berenice, who, after Ptolemy's death,
thought fit to detain Demetrius as a prisoner in the
country until some decision should be taken concerning him. There he lived in great dejection, and
somehow, in his sleep, received an asp-bite on the
hand which proved fatal. He is buried in the district of Busiris near Diospolis.</p></div>

<p>Hermippus relates that, when their territory was
visited by famine, the people of Heraclea besought
the Pythian priestess for relief, but Heraclides bribed
the sacred envoys as well as the aforesaid priestess
to reply that they would be rid of the calamity if
Heraclides, the son of Euthyphro, were crowned with
a crown of gold in his lifetime and after his death
received heroic honours. The pretended oracle was
brought home, but its forgers got nothing by it.
For directly Heraclides was crowned in the theatre,
<pb n='547'/>
he was seized with apoplexy, whereupon the envoys
to the oracle were stoned to death. Moreover, at
the very same time the Pythian priestess, after she
had gone down to the shrine and taken her seat,
was bitten by one of the snakes and died instantly.
Such are the tales told about his death.</p></div>

                                on the works of Homer and Hesiod was plagiarized from his own.
                                Furthermore, Autodorus the Epicurean criticizes him in a polemic

                                would not have turned out so brave. He himself showed his contempt

                                any better born than snails or wingless locusts. </p>

<p>Later on, however, he came into touch with
Socrates, and derived so much benefit from him that he used to
advise his own disciples to become fellow-pupils with him of
Socrates. He lived in the Peiraeus, and every day would tramp the
five miles to Athens in order to hear Socrates. From Socrates he
learned his hardihood, emulating his disregard of feeling, and thus
he inaugurated the Cynic way of life. He demonstrated that pain is a
good thing by instancing the great Heracles and Cyrus, drawing the
one example from the Greek world and the other from the
barbarians.

tenets proper ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξαι, δόγματα</foreign>).
The last ( § 13) seems to be derived from Diocles.</note> with
him were the following. He would prove that virtue can be taught;
that

nobility belongs to none other than the
virtuous. </p></div>

    <p rend="merge">And he held virtue to be sufficient in itself to ensure
happiness, since it needed nothing else except the strength of a
Socrates. And he maintained that virtue is an affair of deeds and
does not need a store of words or learning; that the wise man is
selfsufficing, for all the goods of others are his; that ill
repute is a good thing and much the same as pain; that the wise man
will be guided in his public acts not by the established laws but by
the law of virtue; that he will also marry in order to have children
from union with the handsomest women; furthermore that he will not
disdain to love, for only the wise man knows who are worthy to be
loved.
</p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Diocles records the following sayings of his: To the
wise man nothing is foreign or impracticable. A good man deserves
to be loved. Men of worth are friends. Make allies of men who are at
once brave and just. Virtue is a weapon that cannot be taken away.
It is better to be with a handful of good men fighting against all
the bad, than with hosts of bad men against a handful of good men.
Pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover
your mistakes. Esteem an honest man above a kinsman. Virtue is the
same for women as for men. Good actions are fair and evil actions
foul. Count all wickedness foreign and alien.

<p>himself too was nicknamed a hound pure and simple. And
he was the first, Diocles tells us, to double his cloak and be

    <head>Chapter 2. DIOGENES (404-323 B.C.)</head> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p>Diogenes was a native of Sinope, son of Hicesius, a
banker. Diocles relates that he went into exile because his father
was entrusted with the money of the state and adulterated the
coinage. But Eubulides in his book on Diogenes says that Diogenes
himself did this and was forced to leave home along with his father.
Moreover Diogenes himself actually confesses in his <hi
rend='ital'>Pordalus</hi> that he adulterated the coinage. Some say
that having been appointed to superintend the workmen he was
persuaded by them, and that he went to Delphi or to the Delian
oracle in his own city and inquired of Apollo whether he should do
what he was urged to do. When the god gave him permission to alter
the political currency, not understanding what this meant, he
adulterated the state coinage, and when he was detected, according
to some he was banished, while according to others he voluntarily
quitted the city for fear of consequences. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
    <p rend="merge">One version is that his
father entrusted him with the money and that he debased it, in
consequence of which the father was imprisoned and died, while the
son fled, came to Delphi, and inquired, not whether he should
falsify the coinage, but what he should do to gain the greatest
reputation; and that then it was that he received the oracle.

<p>On reaching Athens he fell in with Antisthenes. Being repulsed by him, because he never welcomed
                                    pupils, by sheer persistence Diogenes wore him out. Once when he
                                    stretched out his staff against him, the pupil offered his head
                                    with the words, <q>Strike, for you will find no wood hard
                                    enough to keep me away from you, so long as I think you've
                                    something to say.</q> From that time forward he was his pupil, and,
                                    exile as he was, set out upon a simple life. </p></div>

<p>Through watching a mouse running about, says
Theophrastus in the Megarian dialogue, not looking for a place to
lie down in, not afraid of the dark, not seeking any of the things
which are considered to be dainties, he discovered the means of
adapting himself to circumstances. He was the first, say some, to
fold his cloak because he was obliged to sleep in it as well, and he
carried a wallet to hold his victuals, and he used any place for any
purpose, for breakfasting, sleeping, or conversing. And then he
would say, pointing to the portico of Zeus and the Hall of

physicians, philosophers and pilots at their work, he deemed man the

                                    Later, when they reached the wrestling-school, he would not
                                    permit the master to give them full athletic training, but only
                                    so much as to heighten their colour and keep them in good

<p>The boys used to get by heart many passages from poets, historians, and the writings of Diogenes
                                    himself; and he would practise them in every short cut to a
                                    good memory. In the house too he taught them to wait upon
                                    themselves, and to be content with plain fare and water to
                                    drink. He used to make them crop their hair close and to wear it
                                    unadorned, and to go lightly clad, barefoot, silent, and not
                                    looking about them in the streets. He would also take them out
                                    hunting. They on their part had a great regard for Diogenes and
                                    made requests of their parents for him. The same Eubulus relates
                                    that he grew old in the house of Xeniades, and when he died was
                                    buried by his sons. There Xeniades once asked him how he wished
                                    to be buried. To which he replied, <q>On my face.</q> </p></div>

                                    from a humble position. Some one took him into a magnificent
                                    house and warned him not to expectorate, whereupon having

                                    shouted out for men, and when people collected, hit out at them
                                    with his stick, saying, <q>It was men I called for, not
                                    scoundrels.</q> This is told by Hecato in the first book of his <hi

                                    his way with head half shaven into a party of young revellers,
                                    as Metrocles relates in his <hi rend="ital">Anecdotes,</hi> and
                                    was roughly handled by them. Afterwards he entered on a tablet
                                    the names of those who had struck him and went about with the
                                    tablet hung round his neck, till he had covered them with
                                    ridicule and brought universal blame and discredit upon them. He
                                    described himself as a hound of the sort which all men praise,
                                    but no one, he added, of his admirers dared go out hunting along
                                    with him. When some one boasted that at the Pythian games he had
                                    vanquished men, Diogenes replied, <q>Nay, I defeat men, you

                                    speed?</q> Having been invited to a dinner, he declared that he
                                    wouldn't go; for, the last time he went, his host had not
                                    expressed a proper gratitude. He would walk upon snow barefoot
                                    and do the other things mentioned above. Not only so; he <pb

                                    manage to digest it. He once found Demosthenes the orator
                                    lunching at an inn, and, when he retired within, Diogenes said,
                                    <q>All the more you will be inside the tavern.</q> When some
                                    strangers expressed a wish to see Demosthenes, he stretched out
                                    his middle finger and said, <q>There goes the demagogue of

<p>He used to say
that he followed the example of the trainers of choruses; for they
too set the note a little high, to ensure that the rest should hit
the right note. Most people, he would say, are so nearly mad that a
finger makes all the difference. For, if you go along with your
middle finger stretched out, some one will think you mad, but, if
it's the little finger, he will not think so. Very valuable things,

<p>He used to affirm that
training was of two kinds, mental and bodily: the latter being that
whereby, with constant exercise, perceptions are formed such as
secure freedom of movement for virtuous deeds; and the one half of
this training is incomplete without the other, good health and
strength being just as much included among the essential things,
whether for body or soul. And he would adduce indisputable evidence
to show how easily from
<pb n='73'/> 
gymnastic training we
arrive at virtue. For in the manual crafts and other arts it can be
seen that the craftsmen develop extraordinary manual skill through
practice. Again, take the case of flute-players and of athletes:
what surpassing skill they acquire by their own incessant toil;
and, if they had transferred their efforts to the training of the
mind, how certainly their labours would not have been unprofitable
or ineffective.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71">
<p>Nothing in life, however, he maintained, has
any chance of succeeding without strenuous practice; and this is
capable of overcoming anything. Accordingly, instead of useless
toils men should choose such as nature recommends, whereby they
might have lived happily. Yet such is their madness that they choose
to be miserable. For even the despising of pleasure is itself most
pleasurable, when we are habituated to it; and just as those
accustomed to a life of pleasure feel disgust when they pass over to
the opposite experience, so those whose training has been of the
opposite kind derive more pleasure from despising pleasure than from
the pleasures themselves. This was the gist of his conversation;
and it was plain that he acted accordingly, adulterating currency in
very truth, allowing convention no such authority as he allowed to
natural right, and asserting that the manner of life he lived was
the same as that of Heracles when he preferred liberty to
everything.

<p>He maintained that all things are the property of
the wise, and employed such arguments as those cited above. All
things belong to the gods. The gods are friends to the wise, and
friends share all property in common; therefore all things are the
property of the wise. Again as to law: that it is
<pb n='75'/>

impossible for society to exist without law; for without a city
no benefit can be derived from that which is civilized. But the city
is civilized, and there is no advantage in law without a city;
therefore law is something civilized. He would ridicule good birth
and fame and all such distinctions, calling them showy ornaments of
vice. The only true commonwealth was, he said, that which is as wide
as the universe. He advocated community of wives, recognizing no
other marriage than a union of the man who persuades with the woman
who consents. And for this reason he thought sons too should be held
in common.

<p>And he saw no impropriety either in stealing anything from a temple or in eating the flesh of any animal; nor even
anything impious in touching human flesh, this, he said, being clear
from the custom of some foreign nations. Moreover, according to
right reason, as he put it, all elements are contained in all things
and pervade everything: since not only is meat a constituent of
bread, but bread of vegetables; and all other bodies also, by means
of certain invisible passages and particles, find their way in and
unite with all substances in the form of vapour. This he makes plain

                                him. And he administered it in all respects in such a manner that

<p>Cleomenes in his work entitled <hi rend='ital'>Concerning Pedagogues</hi> says that the friends of Diogenes wanted to ransom him,
whereupon he called them simpletons; for, said he, lions are not
the slaves of those who feed them, but rather those who feed them
are at the mercy of the lions: for fear is the mark of the slave,
whereas wild beasts make men afraid of them. The man had in fact a
wonderful gift of persuasion, so that he could easily vanquish
anyone he liked in argument. At all events a certain Onesicritus of
Aegina is said to have sent to Athens the one of his two sons named
Androsthenes, and he having become a pupil of Diogenes stayed there; the father then sent the other also, the aforesaid Philiscus, who
was the elder, in search of him; but Philiscus also was detained in
the same way. </p></div>

    <p rend="merge">When, thirdly, the father himself arrived, he was just
as much attracted to the
<pb n='79'/> 
pursuit of philosophy
as his sons and joined the circle--so magical was the spell which
the discourses of Diogenes exerted. Amongst his hearers was Phocion
surnamed the Honest, and Stilpo the Megarian, and many other men
prominent in political life.
</p> 
<p>Diogenes is said to have been
nearly ninety years old when he died. Regarding his death there are
several different accounts. One is that he was seized with colic
after eating an octopus raw and so met his end. Another is that he
died voluntarily by holding his breath. This account was followed by
Cercidas of Megalopolis (or of Crete), who in his meliambics writes
thus:
</p> 
<p>Not so he who aforetime was a citizen of Sinope,
</p>

<p>That famous one who carried a staff, doubled his cloak, and lived
in the open air.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77">
<p>But he soared aloft with his lip tightly
pressed against his teeth
</p> 
<p>And holding his breath withal. For
in truth he was rightly named
</p> 
<p>Diogenes, a true-born son of
Zeus, a hound of heaven.
</p> 
<p>Another version is that, while
trying to divide an octopus amongst the dogs, he was so severely
bitten on the sinew of the foot that it caused his death. His
friends, however, according to Antisthenes in his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi>, conjectured that it
was due to the retention of his breath. For he happened to be living
in the Craneum, the gymnasium in front of Corinth. When his friends
came according to custom and found him wrapped up in his cloak, they
thought that he must be asleep, although he was by no means of a
drowsy or somnolent habit. They therefore drew aside his cloak and
found that
<pb n='81'/> 
he was dead. This they supposed to
have been his deliberate act in order to escape thenceforward from
life.

<p>Hence, it is said, arose a quarrel among his disciples as to who should bury him: nay, they even came to blows;
but, when their fathers and men of influence arrived, under their
direction he was buried beside the gate leading to the Isthmus. Over
his grave they set up a pillar and a dog in Parian marble upon it.
Subsequently his fellow-citizens honoured him with bronze statues,
on which these verses were inscribed:
</p> 
<p>Time makes even bronze
grow old: but thy glory, Diogenes, all eternity will never destroy.

that they should throw him out unburied, that every wild beast might
feed on him, or thrust him into a ditch and sprinkle a little dust

should throw him into the Ilissus, in order that he might be useful

Good, On Love, A Mendicant, Tolmaeus, Pordalus, Casandrus, Cephalion, Philiscus, Aristarchus, Sisyphus, Ganymedes, Anecdotes,
Letters.
</p> 
<p>There have been five men who were named Diogenes. The first, of Apollonia, a natural philosopher.
                                    <pb n="85"/> The beginning of his treatise runs thus: <q>At
                                the outset of every discourse, methinks, one should see to it that
                                the basis laid down is unquestionable.</q> The second--of Sicyon--who
                                wrote an <q>Account of Peloponnesus.</q> The third, our present
                                subject. The fourth, a Stoic born at Seleucia, who is also called
                                the Babylonian, because Seleucia is near Babylon. The fifth, of
                                Tarsus, author of a work on poetical problems, which he attempts to
                                solve. </p> 
<p>Now
the philosopher is said by Athenodorus in the eighth book of his <hi

to his use of unguents.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Epictet.

    Chapter 3. MONIMUS (fourth
century B.C.)</head> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82">
<p>Monimus of Syracuse was a pupil of Diogenes; and, according to Sosicrates, he was in the service of a certain
Corinthian banker, to whom Xeniades, the purchaser of Diogenes, made
frequent visits, and by the account which he gave of his goodness in
word and deed, excited in Monimus a passionate admiration of
Diogenes. For he forthwith pretended to be mad and proceeded to
fling away the small change and all the money on the banker's table,
until at length his master dismissed him; and he then straightway
devoted himself to Diogenes. He often followed Crates the Cynic as
well, and embraced the like pursuits; whereupon his master, seeing
him do this, was all the more persuaded that he was mad.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83">
<p>He
came to be a distinguished man; so much so that he is even

</p> 
<p>Monimus indeed showed himself a very grave

    <head>Chapter 4. ONESICRITUS (flor. 330 B.C.)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84">
<p>Onesicritus some report to have been an Aeginetan, but Demetrius
of Magnesia says that he was a native of Astypalaea. He too was one
of the distinguished pupils of Diogenes. His career seems to have
resembled that of Xenophon; for Xenophon joined the expedition of
Cyrus, Onesicritus that of Alexander; and the former wrote the <hi
rend='ital'>Cyropaedia, or Education of Cyrus</hi>, while the latter
has described how Alexander was educated: the one a laudation of
Cyrus, the other of Alexander. And in their diction they are not
unlike: except that Onesicritus, as is to be expected in an
imitator, falls short of his model.
</p> 
<p>Amongst other pupils of Diogenes were Menander, who was nicknamed Drymus or <q>Oakwood,</q> a

<p>He flourished in the 113th Olympiad.<note
n='b'>328-324 b.c.</note>
</p> 
<p>According to Antisthenes in his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions</hi>, the first impulse to the Cynic
philosophy was given to him when he saw Telephus in a certain
tragedy carrying a little basket and altogether in a wretched
plight. So he turned his property into money,--for he belonged to a
distinguished family,--and having thus collected about 200 talents,
distributed that sum among his fellow-citizens. And (it is added) so
sturdy a philosopher did he become that he is mentioned by the
comic poet Philemon. At all events the latter says:
</p> 
<p>In
summer-time a thick cloak he would wear
</p> 
<p>To be like Crates,
and in winter rags.
</p> 
<p>Diocles relates how Diogenes persuaded
Crates to give up his fields to sheep pasture, and throw into the
sea any money he had.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88">
<p>In the home of Crates Alexander is said
to have lodged, as Philip once lived in Hipparchia's. Often, too,
certain of his kinsmen would come to visit him and try to divert him
from his purpose. These he would drive from him with his stick, and
his resolution was unshaken. Demetrius of Magnesia tells a story
that he entrusted a banker with a sum of money on condition that, if
his sons proved ordinary men he was to pay it to them, but, if they
became
<pb n='93'/> 
philosophers, then to distribute it among
the people: for his sons would need nothing, if they took to
philosophy. Eratosthenes tells us that by Hipparchia, of whom we
shall presently speak, he had a son born to him named Pasicles, and
after he had ceased to be a cadet on service, Crates took him to a
brothel and told him that was how his father had married.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89">
    <p rend="merge">The
marriage of intrigue and adultery, he said, belonged to tragedy,
having exile or assassination as its rewards; while the weddings
of those who take up with courtesans are material for comedy, for as
a result of extravagance and drunkenness they bring about
madness.
</p> 
<p>This man had a brother named Pasicles, who was a
disciple of Euclides.
</p> 
<p>Favorinus, in the second book of his <hi rend="ital">Memorabilia</hi>, tells a pleasant story of
                                Crates. For he relates how, when making some request of the master
                                of the gymnasium, he laid hold on his hips; and when he demurred,
                                said, <q>What, are not these hip-joints yours as much as your
                                knees?</q> It was, he used to say, impossible to find anybody wholly
                                free from flaws; but, just as in a pomegranate, one of the seeds is
                                always going bad. Having exasperated the musician Nicodromus, he was
                                struck by him on the face. So he stuck a plaster on his forehead
                                with these words on it, <q>Nicodromus's handiwork.</q></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90">
    <p rend="merge">He carried on a
regular campaign of invective against the courtesans, habituating
himself to meet their abuse.
</p> 
<p>When Demetrius of Phalerum sent him loaves of bread and some wine, he reproached him, saying,
                                <q>Oh that the springs yielded bread as well as water!</q> It is
                                clear, then, that he was a water-drinker. When <pb n="95"/> the

                                answer was, <q>I'll show you that Theophrastus also wears
                                muslin.</q> This they would not believe: so he led them to a barber's
                                shop and showed them Theophrastus being shaved. At Thebes he was
                                flogged by the master of the gymnasium--another version being that
                                it was by Euthycrates and at Corinth; and being dragged by the
                                heels, he called out, as if it did not affect him<note n="a"

<p>Diocles, however, says
that it was by Menedemus of Eretria that he was thus dragged. For he
being handsome and being thought to be intimate with Asclepiades the
Phliasian, Crates slapped him on the side with a brutal taunt;
whereupon Menedemus, full of indignation, dragged him along, and he
declaimed as above.
</p> 
<p>Zeno of Citium in his <hi rend="ital">Anecdotes</hi> relates that in a fit of heedlessness he
                                sewed a sheepskin to his cloak. He was ugly to look at, and when
                                performing his gymnastic exercises used to be laughed at. He was
                                accustomed to say, raising his hands, <q>Take heart, Crates, for

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94">
<p>Metrocles of Maroneia was the brother of
Hipparchia. He had been formerly a pupil of Theophrastus the
Peripatetic, and had been so far corrupted by weakness that, when
he made a breach of good manners in the course of rehearsing a
speech, it drove him to despair, and he shut himself up at home,
intending to starve himself to death. On learning this Crates came
to visit him as he had been asked to do, and after advisedly making
a meal of lupins, he tried to persuade him by argument as well that
he had committed no crime, for a prodigy would have happened if he
had not taken the natural means of relieving
<pb n='99'/>

himself. At last by reproducing the action he succeeded in
lifting him from his dejection, using for his consolation the
likeness of the occurrences. From that time forward Metrocles was
his pupil, and became proficient in philosophy.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96">
<p>Hipparchia too, sister of Metrocles, was captured by
their doctrines. Both of them were born at Maroneia.

                                were given in marriage to him. Crates therefore was implored by her
                                parents to dissuade the girl, and did all he could, and at last,
                                failing to persuade her, got up, took off his clothes before her
                                face and said, <q>This is the bridegroom, here are his

Accordingly she appeared at the banquet given by Lysimachus, and
there put down Theodorus, known as the atheist, by means of the
following sophism. Any action which would not be called wrong if
done by Theodorus, would not be called wrong if done by Hipparchia.
Now Theodorus does no wrong when he strikes himself: therefore
neither does Hipparchia do wrong when she strikes Theodorus. He had
no reply wherewith to meet the argument, but tried to strip her of
her cloak. But Hipparchia showed no sign of alarm or of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102">
<p>Menedemus was a pupil of
Colotes of Lampsacus. According to Hippobotus he had attained such
a
<pb n='107'/> 
degree of audacity in wonder-working that he
went about in the guise of a Fury, saying that he had come from
Hades to take cognisance of sins committed, and was going to
return and report them to the powers down below. This was his attire: a grey tunic reaching to the feet, about it a crimson girdle; an
Arcadian hat on his head with the twelve signs of the zodiac
inwrought in it; buskins of tragedy; and he wore a very long beard
and carried an ashen staff in his hand.

<p>Such are the lives of the several Cynics. But we will go on to append the doctrines which they
                                held in common--if, that is, we decide that Cynicism is really a
                                philosophy, and not, as some maintain, just a way of life. They are
                                content then, like Ariston of Chios, to do away with the subjects of
                                Logic and Physics and to devote their whole attention to Ethics. And
                                what some assert of Socrates, Diocles records of Diogenes,
                                representing him as saying: <q>We must inquire into </q></p>

    <p><hi rend='center'><q rend="merge">Whate'er of good or ill within our halls is
wrought.</q><note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Hom. <hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> iv.

</p> 
<p>They also dispense with the ordinary
subjects of instruction. At least Antisthenes used to say that
those who had attained discretion had better not study literature,
lest they should be perverted by alien influences. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104">
    <p rend="merge">So they get rid
of geometry and music and all such studies. Anyhow, when somebody
showed Diogenes a clock, he pronounced it a serviceable instrument
to save one from being late for dinner. Again, to a man who gave a
musical recital before him he said<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi

</p> 
<p>By men's minds states are ordered well, and

<p>Not by the lyre's twanged strings or flute's
trilled notes.
</p></div> <pb n='109'/> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105">
<p>They hold further that <q>Life according to Virtue</q> is the End to be sought, as Antisthenes
                                says in his <hi rend="ital">Heracles</hi>: exactly like the Stoics.
                                For indeed there is a certain close relationship between the two
                                schools. Hence it has been said that Cynicism is a short cut to
                                virtue; and after the same pattern did Zeno of Citium live his
                                life. </p> 
<p>They also hold that we should live frugally, eating
food for nourishment only and wearing a single garment. Wealth and
fame and high birth they despise. Some at all events are vegetarians
and drink cold water only and are content with any kind of shelter
or tubs, like Diogenes, who used to say that it was the privilege of
the gods to need nothing and of god-like men to want but little.
</p>

<p>They hold, further, that virtue can be taught, as Antisthenes
maintains in his <hi rend='ital'>Heracles</hi>, and when once
acquired cannot be lost; and that the wise man is worthy to be
loved, impeccable, and a friend to his like; and that we should
entrust nothing to fortune. Whatever is intermediate between Virtue
and Vice they, in agreement with Ariston of Chios, account
indifferent.
</p> 
<p>So much, then, for the Cynics. We must now pass
on to the Stoics, whose founder was Zeno, a disciple of
Crates.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"><head>Chapter 1. ZENO (333-261 B.C.)</head> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>Zeno, the son
of Mnaseas (or Demeas), was a native of Citium in Cyprus, a Greek
city which had received Phoenician settlers. He had a wry neck, says
Timotheus of Athens in his book <hi rend='ital'>On Lives.</hi>
Moreover, Apollonius of Tyre says he was lean, fairly tall, and
swarthy--hence some one called him an Egyptian vine-branch,
according to Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Proverbs.</hi> He had thick legs; he was flabby and
delicate. Hence Persaeus in his <hi rend='ital'>Convivial
Reminiscences</hi> relates that he declined most invitations to
dinner. They say he was fond of eating green figs and of basking in
the sun.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>He was a pupil of Crates, as stated above. Next they
say he attended the lectures of Stilpo and Xenocrates for ten
years--so Timocrates says in his <hi rend='ital'>Dion</hi>--and
Polemo as well. It is stated by Hecato and by Apollonius of Tyre in
his first book on Zeno that he consulted the oracle to know what he
should do to attain the best life, and that the god's response was
that he should take on the complexion of the dead. Whereupon,
perceiving what this meant, he studied ancient authors. Now the way
he came
<pb n='113'/> 
across Crates was this. He was
shipwrecked on a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus with a cargo of
purple. He went up into Athens and sat down in a bookseller's shop,
being then a man of thirty. As he went on reading the second book of
Xenophon's <hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, he was so pleased that
he inquired where men like Socrates were to be found. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
    <p rend="merge">Crates passed by in the nick of time, so the bookseller pointed to him and said,
                                <q>Follow yonder man.</q> From that day he became Crates's pupil,
                                showing in other respects a strong bent for philosophy, though with
                                too much native modesty to assimilate Cynic shamelessness. Hence
                                Crates, desirous of curing this defect in him, gave him a potful of
                                lentil-soup to carry through the Ceramicus; and when he saw that he
                                was ashamed and tried to keep it out of sight, with a blow of his
                                staff he broke the pot. As Zeno took to flight with the lentil-soup
                                flowing down his legs, <q>Why run away, my little Phoenician?</q>
                                quoth Crates, <q>nothing terrible has befallen you.</q> </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>For a certain space, then, he was instructed by Crates, and when at this time he had written his
                                    <hi rend="ital">Republic</hi>, some said in jest that he had
                                written it on Cynosura, <hi rend="ital">i.e.</hi> on the dog's

                                    notably one in Athens and one in Salamis. Relatively to
                                    Cynicism, <q>holding on by the dog's tail</q> would seem a more

<p>Recollections of Crates.
</p> 
<p>Ethics.
</p> 
<p>This is a list of his writings. But at last he left Crates, and the men above mentioned were his
                                masters for twenty years. Hence he is reported to have said, <q>I
                                made a prosperous voyage when I suffered shipwreck.</q> But others
                                attribute this saying of his to the time when he was under Crates. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
    <p rend="merge">A different version of the story is that he was staying at Athens when he heard
                                his ship was wrecked and said, <q>It is well done of thee,
                                Fortune, thus to drive me to philosophy.</q> But some say that he
                                disposed of his cargo in Athens, before he turned his attention to
                                philosophy. </p> 
<p>He used then to discourse, pacing up and down in the painted colonnade, which is also called the
                                colonnade or Portico<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Our word
                                    <q>colonnade</q> better describes a roofed building, supported

                                    thoroughfare like an arcade or cloister, but open to the sun and
                                    air. Owing, however, to the Latin <q><foreign xml:lang="lat">porticus</foreign></q> Zeno's school
                                    has received in English literature the appellation of <q>the

                                Polygnotus; his object being to keep the spot clear of a concourse
                                of idlers. It was the spot where in the time of the Thirty 1400
                                Athenian citizens had been put to death.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"
                                    >Probably the Thirty met in the Stoa and passed sentence of
                                    death there. It is not likely that this was the place of
                                    execution.</note> Hither, then, people came henceforth to hear
                                Zeno, and this is why they were known as men of the Stoa, or Stoics
                                ; and the same name was given to his followers, who had formerly
                                been known as Zenonians. So it is stated by Epicurus in his letters.
                                According to Eratosthenes in his eighth book <hi rend="ital">On the
                                    Old Comedy,</hi> the name of Stoic had formerly been applied to
                                the poets who passed their time there, and they had made the name of
                                Stoic still more famous. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>The people
of Athens held Zeno in high honour, as is proved by their depositing
with him the keys of the city walls, and their honouring him with a
golden crown and a bronze statue. This last mark of respect was also
shown to him by citizens of his native town, who deemed his statue
an ornament to their city,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">Pliny, <hi
rend='ital'>N.H.</hi> xxxiv. 92.</note> and the men of Citium living
in Sidon were also proud to claim him for their own. Antigonus
(Gonatas) also favoured him, and whenever he came to Athens would
hear him lecture and often invited him to come to his court. This
offer he declined but dispatched thither one of his friends,
Persaeus, the son of Demetrius and a native of Citium, who
flourished in the 130th Olympiad (260-256 b.c.), at which time Zeno
was already an old man. According to Apollonius of Tyre in his work
upon Zeno, the letter of Antigonus was couched in the following
terms:
</p></div>
    <pb n='119'/> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p><q>King Antigonus to Zeno the philosopher, greeting. </q></p> 
    <p><q rend="merge">While in fortune and fame I deem myself your superior, in reason and education I own myself
                                inferior, as well as in the perfect happiness which you have
                                attained. Wherefore I have decided to ask you to pay me a visit,
                                being persuaded that you will not refuse the request. By all means,
                                then, do your best to hold conference with me, understanding clearly
                                that you will not be the instructor of myself alone but of all the
                                Macedonians taken together. For it is obvious that whoever instructs
                                the ruler of Macedonia and guides him in the paths of virtue will
                                also be training his subjects to be good men. As is the ruler, such
                                for the most part it may be expected that his subjects will become. </q></p> 
<p>And Zeno's reply is as follows:
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p><q>Zeno to King Antigonus, greeting. </q></p> 
    <p><q rend="merge">I welcome your love of learning in so far as you cleave to that true education which tends
                                to advantage and not to that popular counterfeit of it which serves
                                only to corrupt morals. But if anyone has yearned for philosophy,
                                turning away from much-vaunted pleasure which renders effeminate the
                                souls of some of the young, it is evident that not by nature only,
                                but also by the bent of his will he is inclined to nobility of
                                character. But if a noble nature be aided by moderate exercise and
                                further receive ungrudging instruction, it easily comes to acquire
                                virtue in perfection. </q></p></div>

<p>Antigonus of Carystus tells us that he never denied that he was a citizen of Citium. For when he

                                money in it, in order that there might be provision at hand for the

                                : so far from all selfconceit was he. In consequence Polemo is said
                                to have addressed him thus: <q>You slip in, Zeno, by the garden
                                door--I'm quite aware of it--you filch my doctrines and give them a

                                in his love of learning. They say too that he first introduced the
                                word Duty and wrote a treatise on the subject. It is said, moreover,
                                that he corrected Hesiod's lines thus:</p>

<p>The story goes that Zeno of Citium after enduring many hardships by reason of old age was set

                            </p> 
<p>For there are
some who hold this to have been the manner of his death.
</p> 
<p>So
much then concerning his death.
</p> 
<p>Demetrius the Magnesian, in
his work on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name</hi>, says of him:
his father, Mnaseas, being a merchant often went to Athens and
brought away many books about Socrates for Zeno while still a boy. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
    <p rend="merge">Hence he had been well trained even before he left his native place. And thus it
                                came about that on his arrival at Athens he attached himself to
                                Crates. And it seems, he adds, that, when the rest were at a loss
                                how to express their views, Zeno framed a definition of the end.
                                They say that he was in the habit of swearing by <q>capers</q> just
                                as Socrates used to swear by <q>the dog.</q> Some there are, and
                                among them Cassius the Sceptic and his disciples, who accuse Zeno at
                                length. Their first count is that in the beginning of his <hi
                                    rend="ital">Republic</hi> he <pb n="145"/> pronounced the
                                ordinary education useless: the next is that he applies to all men
                                who are not virtuous the opprobrious epithets of foemen, enemies,
                                slaves, and aliens to one another, parents to children, brothers to
                                brothers, friends to friends. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
<p>Again, in the <hi
rend='ital'>Republic</hi>, making an invidious contrast, he
declares the good alone to be true citizens or friends or kindred or
free men; and accordingly in the view of the Stoics parents and
children are enemies, not being wise. Again, it is objected, in the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he lays down community of wives, and
at line 200 prohibits the building of temples, lawcourts and
gymnasia in cities; while as regards a currency he writes that we
should not think it need be introduced either for purposes of
exchange or for travelling abroad. Further, he bids men and women
wear the same dress and keep no part of the body entirely covered. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
    <p rend="merge">That the <hi rend="ital">Republic</hi> is the work of Zeno is attested by
                                Chrysippus in his <hi rend="ital">De Republica.</hi> And he
                                discussed amatory subjects in the beginning of that book of his
                                which is entitled <q>The Art of Love.</q> Moreover, he writes much
                                the same in his <hi rend="ital">Interludes.</hi> So much for the
                                criticisms to be found not only in Cassius but in Isidorus of
                                Pergamum, the rhetorician. Isidorus likewise affirms that the
                                passages disapproved by the school were expunged from his works by
                                Athenodorus the Stoic, who was in charge of the Pergamene library;
                                and that afterwards, when Athenodorus was detected and compromised,
                                they were replaced. So much concerning the passages in his writings
                                which are regarded as spurious. </p></div>

                                his estate had been ravaged by the enemy, and as his countenance

<p>I have decided to give a general account of
all the Stoic doctrines in the life of Zeno because he was the
founder of the School. I have already given a list of his numerous
writings, in which he has spoken as has no other of the Stoics. And
his tenets in general are as follows. In accordance with my usual
practice a summary statement must suffice.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">Laertius
adheres to his plan of arranging doctrine under two heads: (1) a
general or summary, (2) a particular, treatment; <hi
rend='ital'>cf. inf.</hi> vii. 48 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφαλα ιωδῶς κατὰ μέρος.</foreign> Here follows a valuable and full
doxography, extending to § 160, collected from various sources; §§ 49-83
come from Diocles. The classification is roughly as follows:
divisions of Philosophy, §§ 39-41; Logic, §§ 42-83; Ethics, §§ 84-131;
Physics, §§ 132-160.</note>
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
<p>Philosophic doctrine, say the
Stoics, falls into three parts: one physical, another ethical, and
the third logical. Zeno of Citium was the first to make this
division in his <hi rend='ital'>Exposition of Doctrine</hi>, and
Chrysippus too did so in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Exposition of Doctrine</hi> and the first book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>; and so
<pb n='151'/> 
too
Apollodorus and Syllus in the first part of their <hi
rend='ital'>Introductions to Stoic Doctrine</hi>, as also Eudromus
in his <hi rend='ital'>Elementary Treatise on Ethics</hi>, Diogenes
the Babylonian, and Posidonius.
</p> 
<p>These parts are called by Apollodorus <q>Heads of Commonplace</q>; by Chrysippus and Eudromus
                                specific divisions; by others generic divisions. </p></div> 

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">
        <p rend="merge">Philosophy, they
say, is like an animal, Logic corresponding to the bones and
sinews, Ethics to the fleshy parts, Physics to the soul. Another
simile they use is that of an egg: the shell is Logic, next comes
the white, Ethics, and the yolk in the centre is Physics. Or, again,
they liken Philosophy to a fertile field: Logic being the
encircling fence, Ethics the crop, Physics the soil or the trees.
Or, again, to a city strongly walled and governed by reason.
</p>

<p>No single part, some Stoics declare, is independent of any other
part, but all blend together. Nor was it usual to teach them
separately. Others, however, start their course with Logic, go on to
Physics, and finish with Ethics; and among those who so do are Zeno
in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Exposition</hi>, Chrysippus,
Archedemus and Eudromus.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
<p>Diogenes of Ptolemaïs, it is true,
begins with Ethics; but Apollodorus puts Ethics second, while
Panaetius and Posidonius begin with Physics, as stated by Phanias,
the pupil of Posidonius, in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Lectures of Posidonius.</hi> Cleanthes makes not three,
but six parts, Dialectic, Rhetoric, Ethics, Politics, Physics,
Theology. But others say that these are divisions not of philosophic
exposition, but of philosophy itself: so, for instance, Zeno of
Tarsus. Some divide the logical part of the system into the two
sciences of rhetoric and dialectic; while
<pb n='153'/> 
some
would add that which deals with definitions and another part
concerning canons or criteria: some, however, dispense with the
part about definitions.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42">
<p>Now the part which deals with canons
or criteria they admit as a means for the discovery of truth, since
in the course of it they explain the different kinds of perceptions
that we have. And similarly the part about definitions is accepted
as a means of recognizing truth, inasmuch as things are apprehended by means of general notions. Further, by rhetoric they
understand the science of speaking well on matters set forth by
plain narrative, and by dialectic that of correctly discussing
subjects by question and answer; hence their alternative definition of it as the science of statements true, false, and neither
true nor false.
</p> 
<p>Rhetoric itself, they say, has three
divisions: deliberative, forensic, and panegyric.
</p> 
<p>Rhetoric
according to them may be divided into invention of arguments, their
expression in words, their arrangement, and delivery; and a
rhetorical speech into introduction, narrative, replies to opponents, and peroration.

written language and the parts of speech, with a discussion of

<p>The study of
syllogisms they declare to be of the greatest service, as showing us
what is capable of yielding demonstration; and this contributes
much to the formation of correct judgements, and their arrangement
and retention in memory give a scientific character to our
conception of things.
</p> 
<p>An argument is in itself a whole
containing premisses and conclusion, and an inference (or syllogism)
is an inferential argument composed of these. Demonstration is an
argument inferring by means of what is better apprehended something
less clearly apprehended.
</p> 
<p>A presentation (or mental
impression) is an imprint on the soul: the name having been
appropriately borrowed from the imprint made by the seal upon the
wax. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46">
    <p rend="merge">There are two species of presentation, the one apprehending a
real object, the other not. The former, which they take to be the
test of reality, is defined as that which proceeds from a real
object, agrees with that object itself, and has been imprinted
seal-fashion and stamped upon the mind:
<pb n='157'/> 
the
latter, or non-apprehending, that which does not proceed from any
real object, or, if it does, fails to agree with the reality itself,
not being clear or distinct.

indispensable and is itself a virtue, embracing other particular

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">
    <p rend="merge">Irrefutability is strength in argument so
as not to be brought over by it to the opposite side. Earnestness
(or absence of frivolity) is a habit of referring presentations to
right reason. Knowledge itself they define either as unerring
apprehension or as a habit or state which in reception of
presentations cannot be shaken by argument. Without the study of
dialectic, they say, the wise man cannot guard himself in argument
so as never to fall; for it enables him to distinguish between
truth and falsehood, and to discriminate what is merely plausible
and what is ambiguously expressed, and without it he cannot
methodically put questions and give answers.

skilful in argument; for it belongs to the same person to converse
well and to argue well, to put questions to the purpose and to

</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49">
<p><q>The Stoics agree to put in the forefront the doctrine of presentation and sensation,
                                inasmuch as the standard by which the truth of things is tested is
                                generically a presentation, and again the theory of assent and that
                                of apprehension and thought, which precedes all the rest, cannot be
                                stated apart from presentation. For presentation comes first; then
                                thought, which is capable of expressing itself, puts into the form
                                of a proposition that which the subject receives from a
                                presentation.</q> </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
<p>There is a difference between the process and the outcome of presentation. The latter is a
                                semblance in the mind such as may occur in sleep, while the former
                                is the act of imprinting something on the soul, that is a process of
                                change, as is set forth by Chrysippus in the second book of his
                                treatise <hi rend="ital">Of the Soul (De anima).</hi> For, says he,
                                we must not take <q>impression</q> in the literal sense of the stamp
                                of a seal, because it is impossible to suppose that a number of such
                                impressions should be in one and the same spot at one and the same
                                time. The presentation meant is that which comes from a real object,
                                agrees with that object, and has been stamped, imprinted and pressed
                                seal-fashion on the soul, as would not be the case if it came from
                                an unreal object. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
<p>According to them some presentations are data of
</p> <pb n='161'/> 
<p>sense and others are not: the former are the impressions conveyed through one or more sense-organs; while the
latter, which are not data of sense, are those received through the
mind itself, as is the case with incorporeal things and all the
other presentations which are received by reason. Of sensuous
impressions some are from real objects and are accompanied by
yielding and assent on our part. But there are also presentations
that are appearances and no more, purporting, as it were, to come
from real objects.
</p> 

<p>Another division of presentations is into
rational and irrational, the former being those of rational
creatures, the latter those of the irrational. Those which are
rational are processes of thought, while those which are irrational
have no name. Again, some of our impressions are scientific, others
unscientific: at all events a statue is viewed in a totally
different way by the trained eye of a sculptor and by an ordinary
man.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52">
<p>The Stoics apply the term sense or sensation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσυης ις</foreign>) to three things: (1) the current
passing from the principal part of the soul to the senses, (2)
apprehension by means of the senses, (3) the apparatus of the
sense-organs, in which some persons are deficient. Moreover, the
activity of the sense-organs is itself also called sensation.
According to them it is by sense that we apprehend black and white,
rough and smooth, whereas it is by reason that we apprehend the
conclusions of demonstration, for instance the existence of gods
and their providence. General notions, indeed, are gained in the
following ways: some by direct contact, some by resemblance, some
by analogy, some by transposition, some by composition, and some by
contrariety.
</p></div> 
    <pb n='163'/> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53">
<p>By incidence or direct contact
have come our notions of sensible things; by resemblance notions
whose origin is something before us, as the notion of Socrates which
we get from his bust; while under notions derived from analogy come
those which we get (1) by way of enlargement, like that of Tityos or
the Cyclops, or (2) by way of diminution, like that of the Pygmy.
And thus, too, the centre of the earth was originally conceived on
the analogy of smaller spheres. Of notions obtained by transposition creatures with eyes on the chest would be an instance, while
the centaur exemplifies those reached by composition, and death
those due to contrariety. Furthermore, there are notions which imply
a sort of transition to the realm of the imperceptible: such are
those of space and of the meaning of terms. The notions of justice
and goodness come by nature. Again, privation originates notions;
for instance, that of the man without hands. Such are their tenets
concerning presentation, sensation, and thought.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54">

<p>The standard
of truth they declare to be the apprehending presentation, <hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> that which comes from a real object--according
to Chrysippus in the twelfth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics</hi> and to Antipater and Apollodorus. Boëthus,
on the other hand, admits a plurality of standards, namely
intelligence, senseperception, appetency, and knowledge; while
Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Exposition of
Doctrine</hi> contradicts himself and declares that sensation and
preconception are the only standards, preconception being a general
notion which comes by the gift of nature (an innate conception of
universals or general concepts). Again, certain others of the older
Stoics make Right Reason the
<pb n='165'/> 
standard; so also
does Posidonius in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the
Standard.</hi>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55">
<p>In their theory of dialectic most of them see
fit to take as their starting-point the topic of voice. Now voice is
a percussion of the air or the proper object of the sense of
hearing, as Diogenes the Babylonian says in his handbook <hi
rend='ital'>On Voice.</hi> While the voice or cry of an animal is
just a percussion of air brought about by natural impulse, man's
voice is articulate and, as Diogenes puts it, an utterance of
reason, having the quality of coming to maturity at the age of
fourteen. Furthermore, voice according to the Stoics is something
corporeal: I may cite for this Archedemus in his treatise <hi

                                stamped on one part of the Greek world as distinct from another, or
                                on the Greeks as distinct from other races; or, again, it means a
                                form peculiar to some particular region, that is to say, it has a
                                certain linguistic quality; <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> in Attic the

difference between voice and speech; because, while voice may
include mere noise, speech is always articulate. Speech again
differs from a sentence or statement, because the latter always
signifies something, whereas a spoken word, as for example <foreign xml:lang="grc"> βλίτυρ ι</foreign> may be unintelligible-- which a
sentence never is. And to frame a sentence is more than mere
utterance, for while vocal sounds are uttered, things are meant,
that is, are matters of discourse.

Lucidity is a style which presents the thought in a way easily
understood; conciseness a style that employs no more words than are
necessary for setting forth the subject in hand; appropriateness

                                rational or irrational (dichotomy). Contrary division dissects the
                                genus into species by contrary qualities: for example, by means of
                                negation, as when all things that are are divided into good and not
                                good. Subdivision is division applied to a previous division: for
                                instance, after saying, <q>Of things that are some are good, some
                                are not good,</q> we proceed, <q>and of the not good some are bad,
                                some are neither good nor bad (morally indifferent).</q> </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62">
<p>Partition in logic is
(according to Crinis) classification or distribution of a genus
under heads: for instance, Of goods some are mental, others
bodily.

<p>Verbal ambiguity arises when a word properly, rightfully, and in accordance with fixed usage
                                denotes two or more different things, so that at one and the same
                                time we may take it in several distinct senses: <hi rend="ital"
                                    >e.g.</hi> in Greek, where by the same verbal expression may be
                                meant in the one case that <q>A house has three times</q> fallen, in
                                the other that <q>a dancing-girl</q> has fallen. </p> 
<p>Posidonius defines Dialectic as the science
dealing with truth, falsehood, and that which is neither true

<pb n='173'/> 
nor false; whereas Chrysippus takes its subject to
be signs and things signified. Such then is the gist of what the
Stoics say in their theory of language.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63">
<p>To the department dealing with things as such and things signified is assigned the doctrine of
                                expressions, including those which are complete in themselves, as
                                well as judgements and syllogisms and that of defective expressions
                                comprising predicates both direct and reversed.<note n="a"

<p>By verbal expression they mean that of which the content corresponds to some rational
                                presentation. Of such expressions the Stoics say that some are
                                complete in themselves and others defective. Those are defective the
                                enunciation of which is unfinished, as <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi>
                                <q>writes,</q> for we inquire <q>Who?</q> Whereas in those that are
                                complete in themselves the enunciation is finished, as
                                <q>Socrates writes.</q> And so under the head of defective
                                expressions are ranged all predicates, while under those complete in
                                themselves fall judgements, syllogisms, questions, and inquiries. </p></div>

<p>A predicate is, according to the followers of Apollodorus, what is said of something; in other
                                words, a thing associated with one or more subjects; or, again, it
                                may be defined as a defective expression which has to be joined on
                                to a nominative case in order to yield a judgement. Of predicates

<p>A judgement is that which is either true or false, or a thing complete in itself, capable of
                                being denied in and by itself, as Chrysippus says in his <hi

                                word for judgement (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξίωνα</foreign> ) is
                                derived from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξιοῦν,</foreign> as
                                signifying acceptance or rejection; for when you say <q>It is
                                day,</q> you seem to accept the fact that it is day. Now, if it really
                                is day, the judgement before us is true, but if not, it is false. </p></div>

    <p rend="merge">There is a difference between judgement, interrogation, and inquiry, as also

                                judgement. For a judgement is that which, when we set it forth in
                                speech, becomes an assertion, and is either false or true: an
                                interrogation is a thing complete in itself like a judgement but

                                and this is so far neither true nor false. Thus <q>It is day</q> is
                                a judgement; <q>Is it day?</q> an interrogation. An inquiry is
                                something to which we cannot reply by signs, as you can nod Yes to

<p>The followers of Chrysippus, Archedemus, Athenodorus, Antipater and Crinis divide propositions
                                into simple and not simple. Simple are those that consist of one or
                                more propositions which are not ambiguous, as <q>It is day.</q> Not
                                simple are those that consist of one or more ambiguous propositions. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69">

                                day,</q> or of more than one proposition, <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi>
                                <q>If it is day, it is light.</q> </p> 
<p>With simple propositions are classed those of negation, denial, privation, affirmation, the
                                definitive and the indefinitive; with those that are not simple the
                                hypothetical, the inferential, the coupled or complex, the
                                disjunctive, the causal, and that which indicates more or less. An
                                example of a negative proposition is <q>It is not day.</q> Of the
                                negative proposition one species is the double negative. By double
                                negative is meant the negation of a negation, <hi rend="ital"

        <pb n="183"/> thetical proposition is false, if the contradictory of its conclusion does

<p>An inferential proposition is true if starting from a true premiss it also has a consequent

                                that does not correspond with the conclusion, as <hi rend="ital"

<p>Again, some things are possible, others impossible; and some things are necessary, others are

    <p rend="merge">A reasonable proposition is one which has to start with more chances of being

<p>And there are other shades of
difference in propositions and grades of transition from true to
false-- and conversions of their terms--which we now go on to
describe broadly.
</p> 
<p>An argument, according to the followers of Crinis, consists of a major premiss, a minor premiss,
                                and a conclusion, such as for example this: <q>If it is day, it
                                is light; but it is day, therefore it is light.</q> Here the sentence
                                <q>If it is day, it is light</q> is the major premiss, the clause
                                <q>it is day</q> is the minor premiss, and <q>therefore it is
                                light</q> is the conclusion. A mood is a sort of outline of an
                                argument, like the following: <q>If the first, then the second;
                                but the first is, therefore the second is.</q> </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77">
<p>Symbolical argument is a combination of full argument and mood; <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi>
                                <q>If Plato is alive, he breathes; but the first is true,
                                therefore the second is true.</q> This mode of argument was introduced
                                in order that when dealing with long complex arguments we should not
                                have to repeat the minor premiss, if it be long, and then state the
                                conclusion, but may arrive at the conclusion as concisely as
                                possible: if A, then B. </p> 
<p>Of arguments some are conclusive, others inconclusive. Inconclusive are such that the
                                contradictory of the conclusion is not incompatible with combination 
                                    <pb n="187"/>of the premisses, as in the following:
                                <q>If it is day, it is light; but it is day, therefore Dion
                                    walks.</q><note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend="ital">Cf.</hi> Sext.

<p>Of conclusive some are denoted by the common name of the whole class, <q>conclusive proper,</q>
                                others are called syllogistic. The syllogistic are such as either do
                                not admit of, or are reducible to such as do not admit of, immediate
                                proof in respect of one or more of the premisses; <hi rend="ital"

                                specifically are those which draw conclusions, but not by syllogism

                                Arguments not syllogistic are those which plausibly resemble
                                syllogistic arguments, but are not cogent proof; <hi rend="ital"

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79">
<p>Further, arguments may be divided into true and false. The former draw their conclusions by means
                                of true premisses; <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> <q>If virtue does
                                good, vice does harm; but virtue does good, therefore vice does

                                which have error in the premisses or are inconclusive; <hi
                                    rend="ital">e.g.</hi> <q>If it is day, it is light; but it
                                is day, therefore Dion is alive.</q> Arguments may also be divided into
                                possible and impossible, necessary and not necessary. Further, there
                                are statements which are indemonstrable because they do not need
                                demonstration; they are employed in the construction of every
                                argument. As to the number of these, authorities differ; Chrysippus
                                makes them five. These are assumed alike in reasoning
    <pb n='189'/> 
specifically conclusive and in syllogisms both
categorical and hypothetical. </p></div>

    <p rend="merge">The first kind of indemonstrable statement is that in which the whole argument

                                while the conclusion is the contradictory of the antecedent; <hi

                                contradictory of the consequent; the conclusion the contradictory
                                of the antecedent. The third kind of indemonstrable employs a
                                conjunction of negative propositions for major premiss and one of
                                the conjoined propositions for minor premiss, concluding thence the
                                contradictory of the remaining proposition; <hi rend="ital"
                                    >e.g.</hi> <q>It is not the case that Plato is both dead and

    <p rend="merge">The fourth kind employs a disjunctive proposition and one of the two
                                alternatives in the disjunction as premisses, and its conclusion is
                                the contradictory of the other alternative; <hi rend="ital"
                                    >e.g.</hi> <q>Either A or B; but A is, therefore B is not.</q>
                                The fifth kind is that in which the argument as a whole is
                                constructed of a disjunctive proposition and the contradictory of
                                one of the alternatives in the disjunction, its conclusion being the
                                other alternative; <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> <q>Either it is day
                                or it is night; but it is not night, therefore it is day.</q> </p>

<p>From a truth a truth follows, according to the Stoics, as <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> <q>It is

<p>Such, then, is the logic of the Stoics, by which they seek to
establish their point that the wise man is the true dialectician.
For all things, they say, are discerned by means of logical study,
including whatever falls within the province of Physics, and again
whatever belongs to that of Ethics. For else, say they, as regards
statement and reasoning Physics and Ethics could not tell how to
express themselves, or again concerning the proper use of terms, how
the laws have defined various actions.<note n="c" xml:lang="eng">
<p>The vulgate, in

the two kinds of common-sense inquiry included under Virtue one
considers the nature of each

the other asks what it is called. Thus much for their logic.

<p>The ethical branch of philosophy they divide as follows: (1) the
topic of impulse; (2) the topic of things good and evil; (3) that
of the passions; (4) that of virtue; (5) that of the end; (6)
that of primary value and of actions; (7) that of duties or the
befitting; and (8) of inducements to act or refrain from acting.
The foregoing is the subdivision adopted by Chrysippus, Archedemus,
Zeno of Tarsus, Apollodorus, Diogenes, Antipater, and Posidonius,
and their disciples. Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes treated the
subject somewhat less elaborately, as might be expected in an older
generation. They, however, did subdivide Logic and Physics as well
as Ethics.

<p>An animal's first impulse, say the Stoics, is to selfpreservation, because nature from the outset

                                constitution. We are forced then to conclude that nature in
                                constituting the animal made it near and dear to itself; for so it
                                comes to repel all that is injurious and give free access to all
                                that is serviceable or akin to it. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86">
<p>As for the assertion made
by some people that pleasure is the object to which the first
impulse of animals is directed, it is shown by the Stoics to be
false. For pleasure, if it is really felt, they declare
</p> <pb
n='195'/> 
<p>to be a by-product, which never comes until nature by
itself has sought and found the means suitable to the animal's
existence or constitution; it is an aftermath comparable to the
condition of animals thriving and plants in full bloom. And nature,
they say, made no difference originally between plants and animals,
for she regulates the life of plants too, in their case without
impulse and sensation, just as also certain processes go on of a
vegetative kind in us. But when in the case of animals impulse has
been superadded, whereby they are enabled to go in quest of their
proper aliment, for them, say the Stoics, Nature's rule is to follow
the direction of impulse. But when reason by way of a more perfect
leadership has been bestowed on the beings we call rational, for
them life according to reason rightly becomes the natural life. For
reason supervenes to shape impulse scientifically.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87">
<p>This is why Zeno was the first (in his treatise <hi rend="ital">On the Nature of Man</hi>) to
                                designate as the end <q>life in agreement with nature</q> (or living
                                agreeably to nature), which is the same as a virtuous life, virtue
                                being the goal towards which nature guides us. So too Cleanthes in
                                his treatise <hi rend="ital">On Pleasure,</hi> as also Posidonius,
                                and Hecato in his work <hi rend="ital">On Ends.</hi> Again, living
                                virtuously is equivalent to living in accordance with experience of
                                the actual course of nature, as Chrysippus says in the first book of
                                his <hi rend="ital">De finibus</hi>; for our individual natures are
                                parts of the nature of the whole universe. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88">
    <p rend="merge">And this is why the end may be defined as life
in accordance with nature, or, in other words, in accordance with
our own human nature as well as that of the universe, a life in
which we refrain from every action forbidden
<pb n='197'/> 
by
the law common to all things, that is to say, the right reason which
pervades all things, and is identical with this Zeus, lord and ruler
of all that is. And this very thing constitutes the virtue of the
happy man and the smooth current of life, when all actions promote
the harmony of the spirit dwelling in the individual man with the
will of him who orders the universe. Diogenes then expressly declares the end to be to act with good reason in the selection of
what is natural. Archedemus says the end is to live in the
performance of all befitting actions.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89">
<p>By the nature with
which our life ought to be in accord, Chrysippus understands both
universal nature and more particularly the nature of man, whereas
Cleanthes takes the nature of the universe alone as that which
should be followed, without adding the nature of the individual.
</p>

<p>And virtue, he holds, is a harmonious disposition, choice-worthy
for its own sake and not from hope or fear or any external motive.
Moreover, it is in virtue that happiness consists; for virtue is
the state of mind which tends to make the whole of life harmonious. When a rational being is perverted, this is due to the
deceptiveness of external pursuits or sometimes to the influence of
associates. For the starting-points of nature are never
perverse.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90">
<p>Virtue, in the first place, is in one sense the
perfection of anything in general, say of a statue; again, it may
be non-intellectual, like health, or intellectual, like prudence.
For Hecato says in his first book <hi rend='ital'>On the
Virtues</hi> that some are scientific and based upon theory, namely,
those which have a structure of theoretical principles, such as
prudence
<pb n='199'/> 
and justice; others are
non-intellectual, those that are regarded as co-extensive and
parallel with the former, like health and strength. For health is
found to attend upon and be co-extensive with the intellectual
virtue of temperance, just as strength is a result of the building
of an arch. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91">
    <p rend="merge">These are called non-intellectual, because they do not
require the mind's assent; they supervene and they occur even in
bad men: for instance, health, courage. The proof, says Posidonius
in the first book of his treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Ethics,</hi>
that virtue really exists is the fact that Socrates, Diogenes, and
Antisthenes and their followers made moral progress. And for the
existence of vice as a fundamental fact the proof is that it is the
opposite of virtue. That it, virtue, can be taught is laid down by
Chrysippus in the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On the
End,</hi> by Cleanthes, by Posidonius in his <hi
rend='ital'>Protreptica,</hi> and by Hecato; that it can be taught
is clear from the case of bad men becoming good.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92">
<p>Panaetius,
however, divides virtue into two kinds, theoretical and practical;
others make a threefold division of it into logical, physical, and
ethical; while by the school of Posidonius four types are
recognized, and more than four by Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Antipater,
and their followers. Apollophanes<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">One of the older
Stoics; <hi rend='ital'>cf. Frag. Vet. Stoic.</hi> i. 90.</note>
for his part counts but one, namely, practical wisdom.
</p>

<p>Amongst the virtues some are primary, some are subordinate to
these. The following are the primary: wisdom, courage, justice,
temperance. Particular virtues are magnanimity, continence,
endurance, presence of mind, good counsel. And wisdom they define as
the knowledge of things good and evil and
<pb n='201'/> 
of
what is neither good nor evil; courage<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">It is obviously
not courage which is here defined, but apparently wisdom over again.
Hence I have marked a lacuna.</note> as knowledge of what we ought
to choose, what we ought to beware of, and what is indifferent;</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93">
    <p rend="merge">justice. . . ; magnanimity as the knowledge or habit of mind which
makes one superior to anything that happens, whether good or evil
equally; continence as a disposition never overcome in that which
concerns right reason, or a habit which no pleasures can get the
better of; endurance as a knowledge or habit which suggests what we
are to hold fast to, what not, and what is indifferent; presence
of mind as a habit prompt to find out what is meet to be done at any
moment; good counsel as knowledge by which we see what to do and
how to do it if we would consult our own interests.
</p>

<p>Similarly, of vices some are primary, others subordinate: <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> folly, cowardice, injustice, profligacy are
accounted primary; but incontinence, stupidity, ill-advisedness
subordinate. Further, they hold that the vices are forms of
ignorance of those things whereof the corresponding virtues are the
knowledge.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94">
<p>Good in general is that from which some advantage comes, and more particularly what is either identical with
or not distinct from benefit. Whence it follows that virtue itself
and whatever partakes of virtue is called good in these three
senses--viz. as being (1) the source from which benefit results; or
(2) that in respect of which benefit results, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the virtuous act; or (3) that by the agency
of which benefit results, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the good man who
partakes in virtue.
</p> 
<p>Another particular definition of good which they give is <q>the natural perfection of a
                                rational being <hi rend="ital">qua</hi> rational.</q> To this answers
                                virtue and, as being <pb n="203"/> partakers in virtue, virtuous
                                acts and good men; as also its supervening accessories, joy and
                                gladness and the like. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95">
    <p rend="merge">So with evils: either they are vices, folly, cowardice,
injustice, and the like; or things which partake of vice, including
vicious acts and wicked persons as well as their accompaniments,
despair, moroseness, and the like.
</p> 
<p>Again, some goods are
goods of the mind and others external, while some are neither mental
nor external. The former include the virtues and virtuous acts;
external goods are such as having a good country or a good friend,
and the prosperity of such. Whereas to be good and happy oneself is
of the class of goods neither mental nor external. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96">
    <p rend="merge">Similarly of
things evil some are mental evils, namely, vices and vicious actions; others are outward evils, as to have a foolish country or a
foolish friend and the unhappiness of such; other evils again are
neither mental nor outward, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be yourself
bad and unhappy.
</p> 
<p>Again, goods are either of the nature of
ends or they are the means to these ends, or they are at the same
time end and means. A friend and the advantages derived from him are
means to good, whereas confidence, high - spirit, liberty, delight,
gladness, freedom from pain, and every virtuous act are of the
nature of ends.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97">
<p>The virtues (they say) are goods of the
nature at once of ends and of means. On the one hand, in so far as
they cause happiness they are means, and on the other hand, in so
far as they make it complete, and so are themselves part of it, they
are ends. Similarly of evils some are of the nature of ends and some
of means, while others are at once both means and ends. Your enemy
and the harm he
<pb n='205'/> 
does you are means;
consternation, abasement, slavery, gloom, despair, excess of grief,
and every vicious action are of the nature of ends. Vices are evils
both as ends and as means, since in so far as they cause misery they
are means, but in so far as they make it complete, so that they
become part of it, they are ends.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98">
<p>Of mental goods some are
habits, others are dispositions, while others again are neither
the one nor the other. The virtues are dispositions, while accomplishments or avocations are matters of habit, and activities as
such or exercise of faculty neither the one nor the other. And in
general there are some mixed goods: <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be
happy in one's children or in one's old age. But knowledge is a pure
good. Again, some goods are permanent like the virtues, others
transitory like joy and walking-exercise.
</p> 
<p>All good (they say)
is expedient, binding, profitable, useful, serviceable, beautiful,
beneficial, desirable, and just or right. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99">
    <p rend="merge">It is expedient, because
it brings about things of such a kind that by their occurrence we
are benefited. It is binding, because it causes unity where unity is
needed; profitable, because it defrays what is expended on it, so
that the return yields a balance of benefit on the transaction. It
is useful, because it secures the use of benefit; it is
serviceable, because the utility it affords is worthy of all praise.
It is beautiful, because the good is proportionate to the use made
of it; beneficial, because by its inherent nature it benefits;
choiceworthy, because it is such that to choose it is reasonable. It
is also just or right, inasmuch as it is in harmony with law and
tends to draw men together.
</p></div> 
    <pb n='207'/> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100">
<p>The reason why they characterize the perfect good as beautiful is that it has in full all the
                                <q>factors</q> required by nature or has perfect proportion. Of the
                                beautiful there are (say they) four species, namely, what is just,
                                courageous, orderly and wise; for it is under these forms that fair
                                deeds are accomplished. Similarly there are four species of the base
                                or ugly, namely, what is unjust, cowardly, disorderly, and unwise.
                                By the beautiful is meant properly and in an unique sense that good
                                which renders its possessors praiseworthy, or briefly, good which is
                                worthy of praise; though in another sense it signifies a good
                                aptitude for one's proper function; while in yet another sense the
                                beautiful is that which lends new grace to anything, as when we say
                                of the wise man that he alone is good and beautiful. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101">
<p>And they say that only the morally beautiful is good. So Hecato in his treatise <hi rend="ital"
                                    >On Goods</hi>, book iii., and Chrysippus in his work <hi
                                    rend="ital">On the Morally Beautiful.</hi> They hold, that is,
                                that virtue and whatever partakes of virtue consists in this: which
                                is equivalent to saying that all that is good is beautiful, or that
                                the term <q>good</q> has equal force with the term <q>beautiful,</q>
                                which comes to the same thing. <q>Since a thing is good, it is
                                beautiful; now it is beautiful, therefore it is good.</q> They hold
                                that all goods are equal and that all good is desirable in the
                                highest degree and admits of no lowering or heightening of
                                intensity. Of things that are, some, they say, are good, some are
                                evil, and some neither good nor evil (that is, morally indifferent). </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102">
<p>Goods comprise the virtues of prudence, justice, courage, temperance, and the rest; while the
                                opposites of these are evils, namely, folly, injustice, and <pb
                                    n="209"/> the rest. Neutral (neither good nor evil, that is) are
                                all those things which neither benefit nor harm a man: such as
                                life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, fair fame and
                                noble birth, and their opposites, death, disease, pain, ugliness,
                                weakness, poverty, ignominy, low birth, and the like. This Hecato
                                affirms in his <hi rend="ital">De fine</hi>, book vii., and also
                                Apollodorus in his <hi rend="ital">Ethics.</hi> and Chrysippus. For,
                                say they, such things (as life, health, and pleasure) are not in
                                themselves goods, but are morally indifferent, though falling under
                                the species or subdivision <q>things preferred.</q> </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103">
    <p rend="merge">For as the property
of hot is to warm, not to cool, so the property of good is to
benefit, not to injure; but wealth and health do no more benefit
than injury, therefore neither wealth nor health is good. Further,
they say that that is not good of which both good and bad use can be
made; but of wealth and health both good and bad use can be made;
therefore wealth and health are not goods. On the other hand,
Posidonius maintains that these things too are among goods. Hecato
in the ninth book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Goods</hi>, and
Chrysippus in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Pleasure</hi>, deny that
pleasure is a good either; for some pleasures are disgraceful,
and nothing disgraceful is good. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104">
    <p rend="merge">To benefit is to set in motion or
sustain in accordance with virtue; whereas to harm is to set in
motion or sustain in accordance with vice.
</p> 
<p>The term <q>indifferent</q> has two meanings: in the first it denotes the things which do not
                                contribute either to happiness or to misery, as wealth, fame,
                                health, strength, and the like; for it is possible to be happy
                                without having these, although, if they are used in a certain way,
                                such use of them tends to <pb n="211"/> happiness or misery. In
                                quite another sense those things are said to be indifferent which
                                are without the power of stirring inclination or aversion; <hi
                                    rend="ital">e.g.</hi> the fact that the number of hairs on one's

                                bent. But it was not in this sense that the things mentioned above
                                were termed indifferent, they being quite capable of exciting
                                inclination or aversion. </p></div>

of something else, and others again both for their own sake and for
the sake of something else. To the first of these classes belong
natural ability, moral improvement, and the like; to the second
wealth, noble birth, and the like; to the last strength, perfect
faculties, soundness of bodily organs. Things are preferred for
their own sake because they accord with nature; not for their own
sake, but for the sake of something else, because they secure not a
few utilities. And similarly with the class of things rejected under
the contrary heads.

<p>Furthermore, the term Duty is applied to that for which, when done,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">The

<p>Zeno was the first to use this term <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθῆκον</foreign> of conduct.

                                    is well seen in Hdt. vii. 22 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ γὰρ Ἄθως

                                    extends to, affects, or is incumbent on us: as near an
                                    approach, perhaps, to the idea of duty as can be expected in any
                                    ancient system of Ethics, which regards human conduct not as
                                    obedience to law, but as determination and pursuit of
                                    good.</note> And it is an action in itself adapted <pb n="215"/>
                                to nature's arrangements. For of the acts done at the prompting of
                                impulse some, they observe, are fit and meet, others the reverse,
                                while there is a third class which is neither the one nor the other. </p> 
<p>Befitting acts are all
those which reason prevails with us to do; and this is the case
with honouring one's parents, brothers and country, and intercourse
with friends. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109">
    <p rend="merge">Unbefitting, or contrary to duty, are all acts that
reason deprecates, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to neglect one's
parents, to be indifferent to one's brothers, not to agree with
friends, to disregard the interests of one's country, and so forth.
Acts which fall under neither of the foregoing classes are those
which reason neither urges us to do nor forbids, such as picking up
a twig, holding a style or a scraper, and the like.
</p> 
<p>Again,
some duties are incumbent unconditionally, others in certain
circumstances. Unconditional duties are the following: to take
proper care of health and one's organs of sense, and things of that
sort. Duties imposed by circumstances are such as maiming oneself
and sacrifice of property. And so likewise with acts which are
violations of duty. Another division is into duties which are always
incumbent and those which are not. To live in accordance with virtue
is always a duty, whereas dialectic by question and answer or
walking-exercise and the like are not at all times incumbent. The
same may be said of the violations of duty. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110">
    <p rend="merge">And in things
intermediate also there are duties; as that boys should obey the
attendants who have charge of them.
</p> 
<p>According to the Stoics
there is an eight-fold
<pb n='217'/> 
division of the soul:
the five senses, the faculty of speech, the intellectual faculty,
which is the mind itself, and the generative faculty, being all
parts of the soul. Now from falsehood there results perversion,
which extends to the mind; and from this perversion arise many
passions or emotions, which are causes of instability. Passion, or
emotion, is defined by Zeno as an irrational and unnatural movement
in the soul, or again as impulse in excess.
</p> 
<p>The main, or most
universal, emotions, according to Hecato in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Passions</hi>, book ii., and Zeno in his treatise
with the same title, constitute four great classes, grief, fear,
desire or craving, pleasure. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111">
    <p rend="merge">They hold the emotions to be
judgements, as is stated by Chrysippus in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Passions</hi>: avarice being a supposition that
money is a good, while the case is similar with drunkenness and
profligacy and all the other emotions.
</p> 
<p>And grief or pain they
hold to be an irrational mental contraction. Its species are pity,
envy, jealousy, rivalry, heaviness, annoyance, distress, anguish,
distraction. Pity is grief felt at undeserved suffering; envy,
grief at others' prosperity; jealousy, grief at the possession by
another of that which one desires for oneself; rivalry, pain at the
possession by another of what one has oneself. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112">

    <p rend="merge">Heaviness or vexation
is grief which weighs us down, annoyance that which coops us up and
straitens us for want of room, distress a pain brought on by anxious
thought that lasts and increases, anguish painful grief, distraction
irrational grief, rasping and hindering us from viewing the
situation as a whole.
</p> <pb n='219'/> 
<p>Fear is an expectation of
evil. Under fear are ranged the following emotions: terror, nervous
shrinking, shame, consternation, panic, mental agony. Terror is a
fear which produces fright; shame is fear of disgrace; nervous
shrinking is a fear that one will have to act; consternation is
fear due to a presentation of some unusual occurrence;</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113">
    <p rend="merge">panic is
fear with pressure exercised by sound; mental agony is fear felt
when some issue is still in suspense.
</p> 
<p>Desire or craving is
irrational appetency, and under it are ranged the following states:
want, hatred, contentiousness, anger, love, wrath, resentment.
Want, then, is a craving when it is baulked and, as it were, cut off
from its object, but kept at full stretch and attracted towards it
in vain. Hatred is a growing and lasting desire or craving that it
should go ill with somebody. Contentiousness is a craving or desire
connected with partisanship; anger a craving or desire to punish
one who is thought to have done you an undeserved injury. The
passion of love is a craving from which good men are free; for it
is an effort to win affection due to the visible presence of beauty. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114">
    <p rend="merge">Wrath is anger which has long rankled and has become malicious,
waiting for its opportunity, as is illustrated by the lines<note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> i. 81, 82.</note>:
</p> 
<p>Even
though for the one day he swallow his anger, yet doth he still keep
his displeasure thereafter in his heart, till he accomplish it.
</p>

<p>Resentment is anger in an early stage.
</p> 
<p>Pleasure is an
irrational elation at the accruing of what seems to be choiceworthy; and under it are ranged ravishment, malevolent joy, delight,
transport. Ravishment is pleasure which charms the ear. Malevolent
joy is pleasure at another's ills. Delight
<pb n='221'/> 
is
the mind's propulsion to weakness, its name in Greek (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τέρψις</foreign> ) being akin to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρέψις</foreign> or turning. To be in transports of
delight is the melting away of virtue.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115">
<p>And as there are said
to be certain infirmities in the body, as for instance gout and
arthritic disorders, so too there is in the soul love of fame,
love of pleasure, and the like. By infirmity is meant disease
accompanied by weakness; and by disease is meant a fond imagining
of something that seems desirable. And as in the body there are
tendencies to certain maladies such as colds and diarrhoea, so it is
with the soul, there are tendencies like enviousness, pitifulness,
quarrelsomeness, and the like.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116">
<p>Also they say that there are
three emotional states which are good, namely, joy, caution, and
wishing. Joy, the counterpart of pleasure, is rational elation;
caution, the counterpart of fear, rational avoidance; for though
the wise man will never feel fear, he will yet use caution. And they
make wishing the counterpart of desire (or craving), inasmuch as it
is rational appetency. And accordingly, as under the primary
passions are classed certain others subordinate to them, so too is
it with the primary eupathies or good emotional states. Thus under
wishing they bring well-wishing or benevolence, friendliness,
respect, affection; under caution, reverence and modesty; under
joy, delight, mirth, cheerfulness.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117">
<p>Now they say that the wise
man is passionless, because he is not prone to fall into such
infirmity. But they add that in another sense the term apathy is
applied to the bad man, when, that is, it means that he is callous
and relentless. Further, the wise
<pb n='223'/> 
man is said
to be free from vanity; for he is indifferent to good or evil
report. However, he is not alone in this, there being another who is
also free from vanity, he who is ranged among the rash, and that is
the bad man. Again, they tell us that all good men are austere or
harsh, because they neither have dealings with pleasure themselves
nor tolerate those who have. The term harsh is applied, however, to
others as well, and in much the same sense as a wine is said to be
harsh when it is employed medicinally and not for drinking at
all.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118">
<p>Again, the good are genuinely in earnest and vigilant for their own improvement, using a manner
                                of life which banishes evil out of sight and makes what good there
                                is in things appear. At the same time they are free from pretence;
                                for they have stripped off all pretence or <q>make-up</q> whether in
                                voice or in look. Free too are they from all business cares,
                                declining to do anything which conflicts with duty. They will take
                                wine, but not get drunk. Nay more, they will not be liable to
                                madness either; not but what there will at times occur to the good
                                man strange impressions due to melancholy or delirium, ideas not
                                determined by the principle of what is choiceworthy but contrary to
                                nature. Nor indeed will the wise man ever feel grief; seeing that
                                grief is irrational contraction of the soul, as Apollodorus says in
                                his <hi rend="ital">Ethics</hi>. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119">
<p>They are also, it is declared, godlike; for they have a something divine within them; whereas
                                the bad man is godless. And yet of this word--godless or
                                ungodly--there are two senses, one in which it is the opposite of
                                the term <q>godly,</q> the other denoting the man who ignores the
                                divine altogether: in this <pb n="225"/> latter sense, as they
                                note, the term does not apply to every bad man. The good, it is
                                added, are also worshippers of God; for they have acquaintance with
                                the rites of the gods, and piety is the knowledge of how to serve
                                the gods. Further, they will sacrifice to the gods and they keep
                                themselves pure; for they avoid all acts that are offences against
                                the gods, and the gods think highly of them: for they are holy and
                                just in what concerns the gods. The wise too are the only priests;
                                for they have made sacrifices their study, as also the building of
                                temples, purifications, and all the other matters appertaining to
                                the gods. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120">
<p>The Stoics approve also of honouring parents and
brothers in the second place next after the gods. They further
maintain that parental affection for children is natural to the
good, but not to the bad. It is one of their tenets that sins are
all equal: so Chrysippus in the fourth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Ethical Questions,</hi> as well as Persaeus and Zeno.
For if one truth is not more true than another, neither is one
falsehood more false than another, and in the same way one deceit
is not more so than another, nor sin than sin. For he who is a
hundred furlongs from Canopus and he who is only one furlong away
are equally not in Canopus, and so too he who commits the greater
sin and he who commits the less are equally not in the path of right
conduct. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121">
    <p rend="merge">But Heraclides of Tarsus, who was the disciple of Antipater
of Tarsus, and Athenodorus both assert that sins are not equal.
</p>

<p>Again, the Stoics say that the wise man will take part in
politics, if nothing hinders him--so, for instance, Chrysippus in
the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Various Types of
Life</hi>--since thus he will restrain vice and promote virtue. Also
(they maintain) he
<pb n='227'/> 
will marry, as Zeno says in
his <hi rend='ital'>Republic,</hi> and beget children. Moreover,
they say that the wise man will never form mere opinions, that is to
say, he will never give assent to anything that is false; that he
will also play the Cynic, Cynicism being a short cut to virtue, as
Apollodorus calls it in his <hi rend='ital'>Ethics</hi>; that he
will even turn cannibal under stress of circumstances. They
declare that he alone is free and bad men are slaves, freedom being
power of independent action, whereas slavery is privation of the
same;</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122">
    <p rend="merge">hough indeed there is also a second form of slavery
consisting in subordination, and a third which implies possession of
the slave as well as his subordination; the correlative of such
servitude being lordship; and this too is evil. Moreover, according
to them not only are the wise free, they are also kings; kingship
being irresponsible rule, which none but the wise can maintain: so
Chrysippus in his treatise vindicating Zeno's use of terminology.
For he holds that knowledge of good and evil is a necessary
attribute of the ruler, and that no bad man is acquainted with this
science. Similarly the wise and good alone are fit to be
magistrates, judges, or orators, whereas among the bad there is not
one so qualified. Furthermore, the wise are infallible, not being
liable to error. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123">
    <p rend="merge">They are also without offence; for they do no hurt
to others or to themselves. At the same time they are not pitiful
and make no allowance for anyone; they never relax the penalties
fixed by the laws, since indulgence and pity and even equitable
consideration are marks of a weak mind, which affects kindness in
place of chastizing. Nor do they deem punishments too severe. Again,
they say that the wise man never wonders at any of the
</p> <pb
n='229'/> 
<p>things which appear extraordinary, such as Charon's
mephitic caverns,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Regarded as passages down to the
underworld; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Virg. <hi rend='ital'>Aen.</hi>
vi. 240 <hi rend='ital'>seq.,</hi> 299.</note> ebbings of the tide,
hot springs or fiery eruptions. Nor yet, they go on to say, will the
wise man live in solitude; for he is naturally made for society and
action. He will, however, submit to training to augment his powers
of bodily endurance.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124">
<p>And the wise man, they say, will offer
prayers, and ask for good things from the gods: so Posidonius in
the first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Duties,</hi> and
Hecato in his third book <hi rend='ital'>On Paradoxes.</hi>
Friendship, they declare, exists only between the wise and good, by
reason of their likeness to one another. And by friendship they mean
a common use of all that has to do with life, wherein we treat our
friends as we should ourselves. They argue that a friend is worth
having for his own sake and that it is a good thing to have many
friends. But among the bad there is, they hold, no such thing as
friendship, and thus no bad man has a friend. Another of their
tenets is that the unwise are all mad, inasmuch as they are not wise
but do what they do from that madness which is the equivalent of
their folly.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125">
<p>Furthermore, the wise man does all things well,
just as we say that Ismenias plays all airs on the flute well. Also
everything belongs to the wise. For the law, they say, has conferred
upon them a perfect right to all things. It is true that certain
things are said to belong to the bad, just as what has been
dishonestly acquired may be said, in one sense, to belong to the
state, in another sense to those who are enjoying it.
</p> 
<p>They
hold that the virtues involve one another, and that the possessor of
one is the possessor of all,
<pb n='231'/> 
inasmuch as they
have common principles, as Chrysippus says in the first book of his
work <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues,</hi> Apollodorus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics according to the Early School,</hi> and Hecato
in the third book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues.</hi></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126">
    <p rend="merge">For if a man be possessed of virtue, he is at once able to discover
and to put into practice what he ought to do. Now such rules of
conduct comprise rules for choosing, enduring, staying, and
distributing; so that if a man does some things by intelligent
choice, some things with fortitude, some things by way of just
distribution, and some steadily, he is at once wise, courageous,
just, and temperate. And each of the virtues has a particular
subject with which it deals, as, for instance, courage is concerned
with things that must be endured, practical wisdom with acts to be
done, acts from which one must abstain, and those which fall under
neither head. Similarly each of the other virtues is concerned with
its own proper sphere. To wisdom are subordinate good counsel and
understanding; to temperance, good discipline and orderliness; to
justice, equality and fair-mindedness; to courage, constancy and
vigour.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127">
<p>It is a tenet of theirs that between virtue and vice
there is nothing intermediate, whereas according to the Peripatetics
there is, namely, the state of moral improvement. For, say the
Stoics, just as a stick must be either straight or crooked, so a man
must be either just or unjust. Nor again are there degrees of
justice and injustice; and the same rule applies to the other
virtues. Further, while Chrysippus holds that virtue can be lost,
Cleanthes maintains that it cannot. According to the former it may
be lost in consequence of drunkenness or melancholy;
</p> <pb n='233'/> 
<p>the latter takes it to be inalienable owing to the
certainty of our mental apprehension. And virtue in itself they hold
to be worthy of choice for its own sake. At all events we are
ashamed of bad conduct as if we knew that nothing is really good but
the morally beautiful. Moreover, they hold that it is in itself
sufficient to ensure well-being: thus Zeno, and Chrysippus in the
first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues,</hi> and
Hecato in the second book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On
Goods:</hi></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128">
    <p rend="merge"><q>For if magnanimity by itself alone can raise us far above everything, and
                                if magnanimity is but a part of virtue, then too virtue as a whole
                                will be sufficient in itself for well-being --despising all things
                                that seem troublesome.</q> Panaetius, however, and Posidonius deny that
                                virtue is self-sufficing: on the contrary, health is necessary, and
                                some means of living and strength. </p>

<p>Another tenet of theirs is the perpetual exercise of virtue, as
held by Cleanthes and his followers. For virtue can never be lost,
and the good man is always exercising his mind, which is perfect.
Again, they say that justice, as well as law and right reason,
exists by nature and not by convention: so Chrysippus in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Morally Beautiful.</hi></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129">
    <p rend="merge">Neither do they think
that the divergence of opinion between philosophers is any reason
for abandoning the study of philosophy, since at that rate we should
have to give up life altogether: so Posidonius in his <hi

Greek education is serviceable.
</p> 
<p>It is their doctrine that
there can be no question of right as between man and the lower
animals, because of their unlikeness. Thus Chrysippus in the first

affection for the youths who by their countenance show a natural
endowment for virtue. So Zeno in his <hi rend='ital'>Republic,</hi>

<p>Their definition of love is an effort toward friendliness due
to visible beauty appearing, its sole end being friendship, not
bodily enjoyment. At all events, they allege that Thrasonides,
although he had his mistress in his power, abstained from her
because she hated him. By which it is shown, they think, that love
depends upon regard, as Chrysippus says in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>Of Love,</hi> and is not sent by the gods. And beauty
they describe as the bloom or flower of virtue.
</p> 
<p>Of the three
kinds of life, the contemplative, the practical, and the rational,
they declare that we ought to choose the last, for that a rational
being is expressly produced by nature for contemplation and for
action. They tell us that the wise man will for reasonable cause
make his own exit from life, on his country's behalf or for the sake
of his friends, or if he suffer intolerable pain, mutilation, or
incurable disease.

<p>It is also their doctrine that amongst the
wise there should be a community of wives with free choice of
partners, as Zeno says in his <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> and

not only they, but also Diogenes the Cynic and Plato].<note

<pb n='237'/> 
of
democracy, kingship, and aristocracy (or the rule of the best).
</p>

<p>Such, then, are the statements they make in their ethical
doctrines, with much more besides, together with their proper proofs: let this, however, suffice for a statement of them in a summary
and elementary form.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132">
<p>Their physical doctrine they divide into
sections (1) about bodies; (2) about principles; (3) about elements;
(4) about the gods; (5) about bounding surfaces and space whether
filled or empty. This is a division into species; but the generic
division is into three parts, dealing with (i.) the universe; (ii.)
the elements; (iii.) the subject of causation.
</p> 
<p>The part
dealing with the universe admits, they say, of division into two:
for with one aspect of it the mathematicians also are concerned, in
so far as they treat questions relating to the fixed stars and the
planets, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> whether the sun is or is not just
so large as it appears to be, and the same about the moon, the
question of their revolutions, and other inquiries of the same sort.
But there is another aspect or field of cosmological<note
n='a'><foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοῦ τοῦ κόσμου.</foreign></note>
inquiry, which belongs to the physicists alone: </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133">
<p rend="merge">this includes such
questions as what the substance of the universe is, whether the sun
and the stars are made up of form and matter, whether the world has
had a beginning in time or not, whether it is animate or inanimate,
whether it is destructible or indestructible, whether it is governed
by providence, and all the rest. The part concerned with causation,
again, is itself subdivided into two. And in one of its aspects
medical inquiries have a share in it, in so far as it involves
investigation of the ruling principle of the soul and the phenomena
of
<pb n='239'/> 
soul, seeds, and the like. Whereas the other
part is claimed by the mathematicians also, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> how vision is to be explained, what causes the
image on the mirror, what is the origin of clouds, thunder,
rainbows, halos, comets, and the like.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134">
<p>They hold that there
are two principles in the universe, the active principle and the
passive. The passive principle, then, is a substance without
quality, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> matter, whereas the active is the
reason inherent in this substance, that is God. For he is
everlasting and is the artificer of each several thing throughout
the whole extent of matter. This doctrine is laid down by Zeno of
Citium in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Existence,</hi> Cleanthes
in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Atoms,</hi> Chrysippus in the first
book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> towards the end, Archedemus
in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Elements,</hi> and Posidonius in
the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Exposition.</hi>
There is a difference, according to them, between principles and
elements; the former being without generation or destruction,
whereas the elements are destroyed when all things are resolved into
fire. Moreover, the principles are incorporeal and destitute of
form, while the elements have been endowed with form.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135">
<p>Body is
defined by Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> as that
which is extended in three dimensions, length, breadth, and depth.
This is also called solid body. But surface is the extremity of a
solid body, or that which has length and breadth only without depth.
That surface exists not only in our thought but also in reality is
maintained by Posidonius in the third book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena.</hi> A line is the extremity of a
surface or length without breadth, or that which has length alone. A
point is the extremity of a line, the smallest possible mark or
dot.

    <p rend="merge">In the beginning
he was by himself; he transformed the whole of substance through
air into water, and just as in animal generation the seed has a
moist vehicle, so in cosmic moisture God, who is the seminal reason
of the universe, remains behind in the moisture as such an agent,
adapting matter to himself with a view to the next stage of
creation. Thereupon he created first of all the four elements, fire,
water, air, earth. They are discussed by Zeno in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi>, by Chrysippus in the first book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Physics,</hi> and by Archedemus in a work <hi

which particular things first come to be at their birth and into
which they are finally resolved. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137">
    <p rend="merge">The four elements together
constitute unqualified substance or matter. Fire is the hot element,
water the moist, air the cold, earth the dry. Not but what the

place; it is also called aether, and in it the sphere of the fixed
stars is first created; then comes the sphere of the planets, next
to that the air, then the water, and lowest of all the earth, which
is at the centre of all things.
</p> 
<p>The term universe or cosmos
is used by them in three senses: (1) of God himself, the individual
being whose quality is derived from the whole of substance; he is
indestructible and ingenerable, being the artificer of this orderly
arrangement, who at stated periods of time absorbs into himself the
whole of substance and again creates it from himself. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138">
    <p rend="merge">(2) Again,
they give the name of cosmos to the orderly

arrangement of the heavenly bodies in itself as such; and (3) in
the third place to that whole of which these two are parts. Again,
the cosmos is defined as the individual being qualifying the whole
of substance, or, in the words of Posidonius in his elementary
treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena</hi>, a system made
up of heaven and earth and the natures in them, or, again, as a
system constituted by gods and men and all things created for their

the deity has his seat.

                                pervades every part of it, just as does the soul in us. Only there
                                is a difference of degree; in some parts there is more of it, in

                                namely, that it is the purer part of the aether; the same which
                                they declare to be preeminently God and always to have, as it were

<p>The world, they say, is one and finite, having a spherical shape, such a shape being the most

are understood by the senses. And that of which the parts are
perishable is perishable as a whole. Now the parts of the world are
perishable, seeing that they are transformed one into the other.

<p>Of the stars some are fixed, and are carried round
with the whole heaven; others, the wandering stars or planets, have
their special motions. The sun travels in an oblique path through
the zodiac. Similarly the moon travels in a spiral path. The sun is
pure fire: so Posidonius in the seventh book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena.</hi> And it is larger than the
earth, as the same author says in the sixth book of his <hi

shape like the world itself according to this same author and his
school. That it is fire is proved by its producing all the effects
of fire; that it is larger than the earth by the fact that all the
earth is illuminated by it; nay more, the heaven beside. The fact
too that the earth casts a conical shadow proves that the sun is
greater than it. And it is because of its great size that it is seen
from every part of the earth.
</p> 
<p>The moon, however, is of a more
earthy composition, since it is nearer to the earth. These fiery
bodies and the stars generally derive their nutriment, the sun from
the wide ocean, being a fiery kindling, though intelligent; the
moon from fresh waters, with an admixture of air, close to the earth
as it is: thus Posidonius in the sixth book of his <hi

from the earth. They hold that the stars are spherical in shape and

always then], although she is in opposition to the sun every month;
because the moon moves in an oblique orbit, diverging in latitude
relatively to the orbit of the sun, and she accordingly goes farther
to the north or to the south. When, however, the moon's motion in
latitude has brought her into the sun's path through the zodiac, and

in his second book <hi rend='ital'>On Substance</hi>, and
Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics.</hi> Matter can also be
acted upon, as the same author says, for if it were immutable, the
things which are produced would never have been produced out of it.
Hence the further doctrine that matter is divisible <hi
rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> Chrysippus says that the division is
not <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, but itself infinite; for
there is nothing infinitely small to which the division can extend.
But nevertheless the division goes on without ceasing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151">
<p>Hence,
again, their explanation of the mixture of two substances is,
according to Chrysippus in the third book of his <hi

through, and that the particles of the one do not merely surround
those of the other or lie beside them. Thus, if a little drop of
wine be thrown into the sea, it will be equally diffused over the
whole sea for a while and then will be blended<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">For the

    <p rend="merge">spring as the right temperature of the air

the localities from which they blow. And the cause of their
production is the sun through the evaporation of the clouds. The
rainbow is explained as the reflection of the sun's rays from watery
clouds or, as Posidonius says in his <hi
rend='ital'>Meteorology</hi>, an image of a segment of the sun or
moon in a cloud suffused with dew, which is hollow and visible
without intermission, the image showing itself as if in a mirror in
the form of a circular arch. Comets, bearded stars, and meteors are
fires which arise when dense air is carried up to the region of
aether. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153">
    <p rend="merge">A shooting star is the sudden kindling of a mass of fire in
rapid motion through the air, which leaves a trail behind it
presenting an appearance of length. Rain is the transformation of
cloud into water, when moisture drawn up by the sun from land or sea
has been only partially evaporated. If this is cooled down, it is
called hoar-frost. Hail is frozen cloud, crumbled by a wind; while
snow is moist matter from a cloud which has congealed: so
Posidonius in the eighth book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse.</hi> Lightning is a kindling of clouds from being rubbed

<p>Nature in their view is an
artistically working fire, going on its way to create; which is
equivalent to a fiery, creative, or fashioning breath. And the soul
is a nature capable of perception. And they regard it as the breath
of life, congenital with us; from which they infer first that it is
a body and secondly that it survives death. Yet it is perishable,
though the soul of the universe, of which the individual souls of
animals are parts, is indestructible. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157">
    <p rend="merge">Zeno of Citium and
Antipater, in their treatises <hi rend='ital'>De anima</hi>, and
Posidonius define the soul as a warm breath; for by this we become
animate and this enables us to move. Cleanthes indeed holds that all

Chrysippus says that only the souls of the wise do so.<note

<p>They count eight parts of
the soul: the five senses, the generative power in us, our power of
speech, and that of reasoning. They hold that we see when the light
between the visual organ and the object stretches in the form of a
cone: so Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics</hi> and Apollodorus. The apex of the cone in
the air is at the eye, the base at the object seen. Thus the thing
seen is reported to us by the medium of the air stretching out
towards it, as if by a stick.

<p>We hear when the air between
the sonant body and the organ of hearing suffers concussion, a
vibration which spreads spherically and then forms waves and strikes

slackening of the tension in our senses, which affects the ruling
part of
<pb n='263'/> 
the soul. They consider that the
passions are caused by the variations of the vital breath.
</p>

<p>Semen is by them defined as that which is capable of generating
offspring like the parent. And the human semen which is emitted by a
human parent in a moist vehicle is mingled with parts of the soul,
blended in the same ratio in which they are present in the parent. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159">
    <p rend="merge">Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>
declares it to be in substance identical with vital breath or
spirit. This, he thinks, can be seen from the seeds cast into the
earth, which, if kept till they are old, do not germinate, plainly
because their fertility has evaporated. Sphaerus and his followers
also maintain that semen derives its origin from the whole of the
body; at all events every part of the body can be reproduced from
it. That of the female is according to them sterile, being, as
Sphaerus says, without tension, scanty, and watery. By ruling part
of the soul is meant that which is most truly soul proper, in which
arise presentations and impulses and from which issues rational
speech. And it has its seat in the heart.

<p>After meeting Polemo, says Diocles of Magnesia, while Zeno was suffering from a protracted
                                illness, he recanted his views. The Stoic doctrine to which he
                                attached most importance was the wise man's refusal to hold mere
                                opinions. And against this doctrine Persaeus was contending when he
                                induced one of a pair of twins to deposit a certain sum with Ariston
                                and afterwards got the other to reclaim it. Ariston being thus
                                reduced to perplexity was refuted. He was at variance with
                                Arcesilaus; and one day when he saw an abortion in the shape of a

acceptance of presentations. Sometimes he used to say there was no
single end of action, but it shifted according to varying
circumstances and objects, as the same bronze might become a statue
either of Alexander or of Socrates. He made a distinction between
end-in-chief and subordinate end: even the unwise may aim at the
latter, but only the wise seek the true end of life. Everything that
lies between virtue and vice he pronounced indifferent. His

                                flattery.</q> Whereupon Cleanthes said, <q>True, but my flattery

                                lyres which, although they give forth sweet sounds, never hear
                                themselves. It is said that when he laid it down as Zeno's opinion
                                that a man's character could be known from his looks, certain witty
                                young men brought before him a rake with hands horny from toil in
                                the country and requested him to state what the man's character was.
                                Cleanthes was perplexed and ordered the man to go away; but when,
                                as he was making off, he sneezed, <q>I have it,</q> cried Cleanthes,

abstained from food for two whole days. As it happened, this
treatment succeeded, so that the doctors were for allowing him to

declaring that he had already got too far on the road, he went on

<p>Amongst those who after the death of Zeno became pupils of Cleanthes was Sphaerus of Bosporus, as

                                One day when a discussion had arisen on the question whether the

                                this was impossible, the king, wishing to refute him, ordered some
                                waxen pomegranates to be put on the table. Sphaerus was taken in and
                                the king cried out, <q>You have given your assent to a
                                presentation which is false.</q> But Sphaerus was ready with a neat
                                answer. <q>I assented not to the proposition that they are
                                pomegranates, but to another, that there are good grounds for
                                thinking them to be pomegranates. Certainty of presentation and
                                reasonable probability are two totally different things.</q>

CHRYSIPPUS (c. 282-206 B.C.)</head> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179">
<p>Chrysippus, the son of
Apollonius, came either from Soli or from Tarsus, as Alexander
relates in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions.</hi> He was a pupil of
Cleanthes. Before this he used to practise as a long-distance runner;
<pb n='289'/> 
but afterwards he came to hear Zeno, or, as
Diocles and most people say, Cleanthes; and then, while Cleanthes
was still living, withdrew from his school and attained exceptional
eminence as a philosopher. He had good natural parts and showed the
greatest acuteness in every branch of the subject; so much so that
he differed on most points from Zeno, and from Cleanthes as well, to
whom he often used to say that all he wanted was to be told what the
doctrines were; he would find out the proofs for himself.
Nevertheless, whenever he had contended against Cleanthes, he would
afterwards feel remorse, so that he constantly came out with the
lines<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Or.</hi> 540-1.</note>:
</p>

<p>Blest in all else am I, save only where

<p>So renowned was he for dialectic that most people thought, if the gods took to dialectic, they
                                would adopt no other system than that of Chrysippus. He had
                                abundance of matter, but in style he was not successful. In industry
                                he surpassed every one, as the list of his writings shows; for
                                there are more than 705 of them. He increased their number by
                                arguing repeatedly on the same subject, setting down anything that
                                occurred to him, making many corrections and citing numerous
                                authorities. So much so that in one of his treatises he copied out
                                nearly the whole of Euripides' <hi rend="ital">Medea</hi>, and some
                                one who had taken up the volume, being asked what he was reading,

                                sat beside him used to say, according to Diocles, that he wrote 500
                                lines a day. Hecato says that he came to the study of philosophy,
                                because the property which he had inherited from his father had been
                                confiscated to the king's treasury. </p></div>

<p>In person he was insignificant, as is shown by the statue in the Ceramicus, which is almost

                                called him Crypsippus or Horse-hidden. Once when somebody reproached
                                him for not going with the multitude to hear Ariston, he rejoined,

                                he said: </p>

                                ass a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs.</q> And thereupon he
                                laughed so heartily that he died. </p> <pb
n='295'/> 
<p>He appears to have been a very arrogant man.<note
n='a'>In §§ 185-189; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Wilamowitz,<hi
rend='ital'>Antig. von K.</hi>pp. 104<hi
rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note>At any rate, of all his many writings he
dedicated none to any of the kings. And he was satisfied with one
old woman's judgement, says Demetrius in his work called <hi
rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name.</hi> When Ptolemy wrote to
Cleanthes requesting him to come himself or else to send some one to
his court, Sphaerus undertook the journey, while Chrysippus declined
to go. On the other hand, he sent for his sister's sons, Aristocreon
and Philocrates, and educated them. Demetrius above mentioned is
also our authority for the statement that Chrysippus was the first
who ventured to hold a lecture-class in the open air in the
Lyceum.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186">
<p>There was another Chrysippus, a native of Cnidus, a
physician,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> viii. 89-90, and note
<hi rend='ital'>ad loc.</hi>; also Pliny, <hi rend='ital'>N.H.</hi>

who on a false charge was dragged about and castigated with the
lash. And yet another was a pupil of Erasistratus, and another the
author of a work on <hi rend='ital'>Agriculture.</hi>
</p> 
<p>To return to the philosopher. He used to propound arguments such as the following: <q>He who
                                divulges the mysteries to the uninitiated is guilty of impiety. Now
                                the hierophant certainly does reveal the mysteries to the
                                uninitiated, <hi rend="ital">ergo</hi> he is guilty of
                                    impiety.</q><note n="d" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend="ital">Cf.
                                        supr.</hi> ii. 101.</note> Or again: <q>What is not in
                                the city is not in the house either: now there is no well in the
                                city, <hi rend="ital">ergo</hi> there is none in the house either.</q>
                                Yet another: <q>There is a certain head, and that head you have
                                not. Now this being so, there is a head which you have not,
                                therefore you are without a head.</q> </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187">
    <p rend="merge">Again: <q>If anyone is in Megara, he is not in Athens: now there is a man in
                                Megara, <pb n="297"/> therefore there is not a man in Athens.</q> Again
                                : <q>If you say something, it passes through your lips: now you
                                say wagon, consequently a wagon passes through your lips.</q> And
                                further: <q>If you never lost something, you have it still; but
                                you never lost horns, <hi rend="ital">ergo</hi> you have horns.</q>
                                Others attribute this to Eubulides. </p> 
<p>There are people
who run Chrysippus down as having written much in a tone that is
gross and indecent. For in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the ancient
Natural Philosophers</hi> at line 600 or thereabouts he interprets
the story of Hera and Zeus coarsely, with details which no one would
soil his lips by repeating. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188">
    <p rend="merge">Indeed, his interpretation of the story
is condemned as most indecent. He may be commending physical doctrine; but the language used is more appropriate to street-walkers
than to deities; and it is moreover not even mentioned by
bibliographers, who wrote on the titles of books. What Chrysippus
makes of it is not to be found in Polemo nor Hypsicrates, no, nor
even in Antigonus. It is his own invention. Again, in his <hi
rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he permits marriage with mothers and
daughters and sons. He says the same in his work <hi rend='ital'>On
Things for their own Sake not Desirable</hi>, right at the outset.
In the third book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Justice</hi>,
at about line 1000, he permits eating of the corpses of the dead.
And in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>On the Means of
Livelihood</hi>, where he professes to be considering <hi
rend='ital'>a priori</hi> how the wise man is to get his living,
occur the words:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189">
    <p rend="merge"><q>And yet what reason is there that he should provide a living? For if it
                                be to support life, life itself is after all a thing indifferent. If
                                it be for pleasure, pleasure too is a thing indifferent. While if it
                                be for virtue, virtue in itself is sufficient <pb n="299"/> to
                                constitute happiness. The modes of getting a livelihood are also
                                ludicrous, as <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> maintenance by a king; for
                                he will have to be humoured: or by friends; for friendship will
                                then be purchasable for money: or living by wisdom; for so wisdom
                                will become mercenary.</q> These are the objections urged against him. </p>

instructed there by Chaldaeans before, on his return to Samos, he
enjoyed the instruction of Pherecydes of Syros and of Hermodainas of
Samos.</note> son of the gem-engraver Mnesarchus, and according to
Hermippus, a Samian, or, according to Aristoxenus, a Tyrrhenian from
one of those islands which the Athenians held after clearing them of
their Tyrrhenian inhabitants. Some indeed say that he was descended
through Euthyphro, Hippasus and Marmacus from Cleonymus, who was
exiled from Phlius, and that, as Marmacus lived in Samos, so
Pythagoras was called a Samian. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
    <p rend="merge">From Samos he went, it is said, to
Lesbos with an introduction to Pherecydes from his uncle Zoïlus. He
had three silver flagons made and took them as presents to each of
the priests of Egypt. He had brothers, of whom Eunomus was the elder
and Tyrrhenus the second; he also had a slave, Zamolxis, who is
worshipped, so says Herodotus,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">iv. 93 <hi
rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note> by the Getans,
<pb n='323'/> 
as
Cronos. He was a pupil, as already stated, of Pherecydes of Syros,
after whose death he went to Samos to be the pupil of Hermodamas,
Creophylus's descendant, a man already advanced in years. While
still young, so eager was he for knowledge, he left his own country
and had himself initiated into all the mysteries and rites not only
of Greece but also of foreign countries. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
    <p rend="merge">Now he was in Egypt when
Polycrates sent him a letter of introduction to Amasis; he learnt
the Egyptian language, so we learn from Antiphon in his book <hi
rend='ital'>On Men of Outstanding Merit</hi>, and he also
journeyed among the Chaldaeans and Magi. Then while in Crete he went
down into the cave of Ida with Epimenides; he also entered the
Egyptian sanctuaries,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Compare Clement Alex. <hi

was told their secret lore concerning the gods. After that he
returned to Samos to find his country under the tyranny of
Polycrates; so he sailed away to Croton in Italy, and there he laid
down a constitution for the Italian Greeks, and he and his followers
were held in great estimation; for, being nearly three hundred in
number, so well did they govern the state that its constitution was
in effect a true aristocracy (government by the best).

<p>This
is what Heraclides of Pontus tells us he used to say about himself:
that he had once been Aethalides and was accounted to be Hermes'
son, and Hermes told him he might choose any gift he liked except
immortality; so he asked to retain through life and through death a
memory of his experiences. Hence in life he could recall everything,
and when he died he still kept the
<pb n='325'/> 
same
memories. Afterwards in course of time his soul entered into
Euphorbus and he was wounded by Menelaus. Now Euphorbus used to say
that he had once been Aethalides and obtained this gift from Hermes,
and then he told of the wanderings of his soul, how it migrated
hither and thither, into how many plants and animals it had come,
and all that it underwent in Hades, and all that the other souls
there have to endure. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
    <p rend="merge">When Euphorbus died, his soul passed into
Hermotimus, and he also, wishing to authenticate the story, went up
to the temple of Apollo at Branchidae, where he identified the
shield which Menelaus, on his voyage home from Troy, had dedicated
to Apollo, so he said: the shield being now so rotten through and
through that the ivory facing only was left. When Hermotimus died,
he became Pyrrhus, a fisherman of Delos, and again he remembered
everything, how he was first Aethalides, then Euphorbus, then
Hermotimus, and then Pyrrhus. But when Pyrrhus died, he became
Pythagoras, and still remembered all the facts mentioned.

<p>The contents in general of the aforesaid three treatises of Pythagoras are as follows. He forbids

                                Drinking he calls, in a word, a snare, and he discountenances all
                                excess, saying that no one should go beyond due proportion either in
                                drinking or in eating. Of sexual indulgence, too, he says,
                                <q>Keep to the winter for sexual pleasures, in summer abstain;
                                they are less harmful in autumn and spring, but they are always
                                harmful and not conducive to health.</q> Asked once when a man should

diet was to practise people and accustom them to simplicity of life,
so that they could live on things easily procurable, spreading their
tables with uncooked foods and drinking pure water only, for this
was the way to a healthy body and a keen mind. Of course the only
altar at which he worshipped was that of Apollo the Giver of Life,

a public library containing it. In any case he deserves praise for
the selection. Between Alexander Polyhistor in the first century

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">
<p>Dicaearchus, however, says that Pythagoras died a fugitive in the
temple of the Muses at Metapontum after forty days' starvation.
Heraclides, in his <hi rend='ital'>Epitome of the Lives of
Satyrus,</hi> says that, after burying Pherecydes at Delos, he
returned to Italy and, when he found Cylon of Croton giving a
luxurious banquet to all and sundry, retired to Metapontum to end
his days there by starvation, having no wish to live longer. On the
other hand, Hermippus relates that, when the men of Agrigentum and
Syracuse were at war, Pythagoras and his disciples went out and
fought in the van of the army of the Agrigentines, and, their line
being turned, he was killed by the Syracusans as he was trying to
avoid the beanfield; the rest, about thirty-five in number, were
burned at the stake in Tarentum for trying to set up a government in
opposition to those in power.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
<p>Hermippus gives another
anecdote. Pythagoras, on coming to Italy, made a subterranean
dwelling and enjoined on his mother to mark and record all that
passed, and at what hour, and to send her notes down to him until he
should ascend. She did so. Pythagoras some time afterwards came up
withered and looking like a skeleton, then went into the assembly
and declared he had been down to Hades, and even read out his
experiences to them. They were so affected that they wept and wailed
and looked upon him as divine, going so far as to send
</p> <pb

<p>their wives to him in hopes that they would learn some
of his doctrines; and so they were called Pythagorean women. Thus
far Hermippus.

<p>Pythagoras had a wife, Theano by name, daughter of Brontinus of Croton, though some call her
                                Brontinus's wife and Pythagoras's pupil. He had a daughter Damo,
                                according to the letter of Lysis to Hippasus, which says of him,
                                <q>I am told by many that you discourse publicly, a thing which
                                Pythagoras deemed unworthy, for certain it is that, when he
                                entrusted his daughter Damo with the custody of his memoirs, he
                                solemnly charged her never to give them to anyone outside his house.
                                And, although she could have sold the writings for a large sum of
                                money, she would not, but reckoned poverty and her father's solemn

Eurytus of Tarentum.
</p> 
<p>There were four men of the name of Pythagoras living about the same time and at no great distance

                                the way that we promised. We have already treated of Theano and
                                Telauges: so now we have first to speak of Empedocles, for some say
                                he was a pupil of Pythagoras. </p></div>
</div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"><head>Chapter 2. EMPEDOCLES
(484-424 B.C.)</head> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
<p>Empedocles was, according to Hippobotus,
the son of Meton and grandson of Empedocles, and was a native of
Agrigentum. This is confirmed by Timaeus in the fifteenth book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Histories</hi>, and he adds that Empedocles, the
poet's grandfather, had been a man of distinction. Hermippus also
agrees with Timaeus. So, too, Heraclides, in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On Diseases</hi>,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">v. 67.</note> says that he
was of an illustrious family, his grandfather having kept
racehorses. Eratosthenes also in his <hi rend='ital'>Olympic
Victories</hi> records, on the authority of Aristotle, that the
father of Meton was a victor in the 71st Olympiad.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">496
b.c.</note></p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52">
    <p rend="merge">The grammarian Apollodorus in his <hi

</p> 
<p>He was the son of
Meton, and Glaucus says he went to Thurii, just then founded.<note

</p> <pb n='369'/> 
<p>Then farther on he
adds:
</p> 
<p>Those who relate that, being exiled from his home, he
went to Syracuse and fought in their ranks against the Athenians
seem, in my judgement at least, to be completely mistaken. For by
that time either he was no longer living or in extreme old age,
which is inconsistent with the story.
</p> 
<p>For Aristotle and
Heraclides both affirm that he died at the age of sixty. The victor
with the ridinghorse in the 71st Olympiad was
</p> 
<p><hi
rend='center'>This man's namesake and grandfather,</hi>
</p> 
<p>so
that Apollodorus in one and the same passage indicates the date as
well as the fact.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53">
<p>But Satyrus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Lives</hi> states that Empedocles was the son of
Exaenetus and himself left a son named Exaenetus, and that in the
same Olympiad Empedocles himself was victorious in the horse-race
and his son in wrestling, or, as Heraclides<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi

Empedocles feasted the sacred envoys on a sacrificial ox made of
honey and barley-meal, and that he had a brother named
Callicratides. Telauges, the son of Pythagoras, in his letter to
Philolaus calls Empedocles the son of Archinomus.

<p>Timaeus in the ninth book of his <hi

<pb n='371'/> 
was a pupil
of Pythagoras, adding that, having been convicted at that time of
stealing his discourses, he was, like Plato, excluded from taking
part in the discussions of the school; and further, that Empedocles himself mentions Pythagoras in the lines<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 129
D.</note>:
</p> 
<p>And there lived among them a man of superhuman
knowledge, who verily possessed the greatest wealth of wisdom.
</p>

<p>Others say that it is to Parmenides that he is here
referring.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55">
<p>Neanthes states that down to the time of Philolaus
and Empedocles all Pythagoreans were admitted to the discussions.
But when Empedocles himself made them public property by his poem,
they made a law that they should not be imparted to any poet. He
says the same thing also happened to Plato, for he too was
excommunicated. But which of the Pythagoreans it was who had
Empedocles for a pupil he did not say. For the epistle commonly
attributed to Telauges and the statement that Empedocles was the
pupil of both Hippasus and Brontinus he held to be unworthy of
credence.
</p> 
<p>Theophrastus affirms that he was an admirer of
Parmenides and imitated him in his verses, for Parmenides too had
published his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Nature</hi> in verse. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56">
    <p rend="merge">But
Hermippus's account is that he was an admirer not so much of
Parmenides as of Xenophanes, with whom in fact he lived and whose
writing of poetry he imitated, and that his meeting with the
Pythagoreans was subsequent. Alcidamas tells us in his treatise on
<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> that Zeno and Empedocles were pupils of
Parmenides about the same time, that afterwards they left him, and
that, while Zeno framed his own system, Empedocles became the pupil
of Anaxagoras and Pythagoras,
<pb n='373'/> 
emulating the
latter in dignity of life and bearing, and the former in his
physical investigations.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57">
<p>Aristotle in his <hi rend='ital'>Sophist</hi> calls Empedocles the inventor of rhetoric
as Zeno of dialectic. In his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Poets</hi>
he says that Empedocles was of Homer's school and powerful in
diction, being great in metaphors and in the use of all other
poetical devices. He also says that he wrote other poems, in
particular the invasion of Xerxes and a hymn to Apollo, which a
sister of his (or, according to Hieronymus, his daughter) afterwards
burnt. The hymn she destroyed unintentionally, but the poem on the
Persian war deliberately, because it was unfinished. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58">
    <p rend="merge">And in general
terms he says he wrote both tragedies and political discourses. But
Heraclides, the son of Sarapion, attributes the tragedies to a
different author. Hieronymus declares that he had come across
forty-three of these plays, while Neanthes tells us that Empedocles
wrote these tragedies in his youth, and that he, Neanthes, was
acquainted with seven of them.
</p> 
<p>Satyrus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Lives</hi> says that he was also a physician and an
excellent orator: at all events Gorgias of Leontini, a man
pre-eminent in oratory and the author of a treatise on the art, had
been his pupil. Of Gorgias Apollodorus says in his <hi
rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> that he lived to be one hundred and
nine. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59">
    <p rend="merge">Satyrus quotes this same Gorgias as saying that he himself was
present when Empedocles performed magical feats. Nay more: he
contends that Empedocles in his poems lays claim to this power and
to much besides when he says<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 111 D.</note>:

                                be flayed and bags to be made of their skin. These he stretched out
                                here and there on the hills and headlands to catch the wind and,
                                because this checked the wind, he was called the <q>wind-stayer.</q>

                                and Satyrus, was his bosom-friend, to whom he dedicated his poem <hi

                                speaking of their luxury, said, <q>The Agrigentines live
                                delicately as if tomorrow they would die, but they build their

Here again a citation from Favorinus seems to disturb the

been a champion of freedom and averse to rule of every kind, seeing
that, as Xanthus relates
<pb n='379'/> 
in his account of him,
he declined the kingship when it was offered to him, obviously
because he preferred a frugal life. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64">
    <p rend="merge">With this Timaeus agrees, at the
same time giving the reason why Empedocles favoured democracy,
namely, that, having been invited to dine with one of the
magistrates, when the dinner had gone on some time and no wine was
put on the table, though the other guests kept quiet, he, becoming
indignant, ordered wine to be brought. Then the host confessed that
he was waiting for the servant of the senate to appear. When he came
he was made master of the revels, clearly by the arrangement of the
host, whose design of making himself tyrant was but thinly veiled,
for he ordered the guests either to drink wine or have it poured
over their heads. For the time being Empedocles was reduced to
silence; the next day he impeached both of them, the host and the
master of the revels, and secured their condemnation and execution.
This, then, was the beginning of his political career.

<p>Again, when Acron the physician asked the council for a site on which to build a monument to his
                                father, who had been eminent among physicians, Empedocles came
                                forward and forbade it in a speech where he enlarged upon equality
                                and in particular put the following question: <q>But what

<p>Subsequently Empedocles broke up
the assembly of the Thousand three years after it had been set up,
which proves not only that he was wealthy but that he favoured the
popular cause. At all events Timaeus in his eleventh and twelfth
books (for he mentions him more than once) states that he seems to
have held opposite views when in public life and when writing
poetry.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">This emphasis on the political leanings of
Empedocles, backed by the authority of Timaeus, looks strange after
the anecdote, also from Timaeus, of §§ 64, 65, nor is it clear that the
attack on the close oligarchical corporation of the Thousand really
took place at a later date (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕστερον</foreign>).
    That D. L. is working in two passages of Timaeus, in
the second of which the first is not pre-supposed, is an obvious
suggestion.</note> In some passages one may see that he is
boastful and selfish. At any rate these are his words:<note

</p> 
<p>All hail! I go about among you an
immortal god, no more a mortal, etc.
</p> 
<p>At the time when he
visited Olympia he demanded an excessive deference, so that never
was anyone so talked about in gatherings of friends as Empedocles.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67">
<p>Subsequently, however, when Agrigentum came to regret
him, the descendants of his personal enemies opposed his return home; and this was why he went to Peloponnesus, where he died. Nor did

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68">
    <p rend="merge">Then, after the feast, the remainder of the company dispersed and
retired to rest, some under the trees in the adjoining field, others
wherever they chose, while Empedocles himself remained on the spot
where he had reclined at table. At daybreak all got up, and he was
the only one missing. A search was made, and they questioned the
servants, who said they did not know where he was. Thereupon someone
said that in the middle of the night he heard an exceedingly loud
voice calling Empedocles. Then he got up and beheld a light in the
heavens and a glitter of lamps, but nothing else. His hearers were
amazed at what had occurred, and Pausanias came down and sent people
to search for him. But later he bade them take no further trouble,
for things beyond expectation had happened to him, and it was their
duty to sacrifice to him since he was now a god.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69">
<p>Hermippus
tells us that Empedocles cured Panthea, a woman of Agrigentum, who
had been given up by the physicians, and this was why he was
offering sacrifice, and that those invited were about eighty in
number. Hippobotus, again, asserts that, when he got up, he set out
on his way to Etna; then, when he had reached it, he plunged into
the fiery craters and disappeared, his intention being to confirm
the report that he had become a god. Afterwards the truth was known,
because
<pb n='385'/> 
one of his slippers was thrown up in
the flames; it had been his custom to wear slippers of bronze. To
this story Pausanias is made (by Heraclides) to take exception.<note

D. L. has inserted, in § 69, (1) a note from Hermippus and (2) a résumé

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70">
<p>Diodorus of Ephesus, when writing of
Anaximander, declares that Empedocles emulated him, displaying
theatrical arrogance and wearing stately robes. We are told that the
people of Selinus suffered from pestilence owing to the noisome
smells from the river hard by, so that the citizens themselves
perished and their women died in childbirth, that Empedocles
conceived the plan of bringing two neighbouring rivers to the place
at his own expense, and that by this admixture he sweetened the
waters. When in this way the pestilence had been stayed and the
Selinuntines were feasting on the river bank, Empedocles appeared;
and the company rose up and worshipped and prayed to him as to a
god. It was then to confirm this belief of theirs that he leapt into
the fire. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71">
    <p rend="merge">These stories are contradicted by Timaeus, who expressly says that he left
                                Sicily for Peloponnesus and never returned at all; and this is the
                                reason Timaeus gives for the fact that the manner of his death is
                                unknown. He replies to Heraclides, whom he mentions by name, in his
                                fourteenth book. Pisianax, he says, was a citizen of Syracuse and
                                possessed no land at Agrigentum. Further, if such a story had been
                                in circulation, Pausanias would have set up a monument to his
                                friend, as to a god, in the form of a statue or shrine, for he was a
                                wealthy man. <q>How came he,</q> adds Timaeus, <q>to leap into
                                the craters, which he had <pb n="387"/> never once mentioned though
                                they were not far off? He must then have died in Peloponnesus. </q></p></div>

<p>Hippobotus assures
us that formerly there was in Agrigentum a statue of Empedocles with
his head covered, and afterwards another with the head uncovered
in front of the Senate House at Rome, which plainly the Romans had
removed to that site. For portrait-statues with inscriptions are
extant even now. Neanthes of Cyzicus, who tells about the
Pythagoreans, relates that, after the death of Meton, the germs of a
tyranny began to show themselves, that then it was Empedocles who
persuaded the Agrigentines to put an end to their factions and
cultivate equality in politics.

<p>Moreover, from his abundant

and a Delphic laurel-wreath. He had thick hair, and a train of boy
attendants. He himself was always grave, and kept this gravity of

as it were, of royalty. But afterwards, as he was going in a

<p>Eudoxus
of Cnidos, the son of Aeschines, was an astronomer, a geometer, a
physician and a legislator. He learned geometry from Archytas and
medicine from Philistion the Sicilian, as Callimachus tells us in
his <hi rend='ital'>Tables.</hi> Sotion in his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi> says that he was also a
pupil of Plato. When he was about twenty-three years old and in
straitened circumstances, he was attracted by the reputation of the
Socratics and set sail for Athens with Theomedon the physician,
who provided for his wants. Some even say that he was Theomedon's
favourite. Having disembarked at Piraeus he went up every day to
Athens and, when he had attended the Sophists' lectures, returned
again to the port. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87">

and, aided by the liberality of his friends, he proceeded to Egypt
with Chrysippus the physician, bearing with him letters of
introduction from Agesilaus
<pb n='403'/> 
to Nectanabis, who
recommended him to the priests. There he remained one year and four
months with his beard and eyebrows shaved, and there, some say, he
wrote his <hi rend='ital'>Octaëteris.</hi> From there he went to
Cyzicus and the Propontis, giving lectures; afterwards he came to
the court of Mausolus. Then at length he returned to Athens,
bringing with him a great number of pupils: according to some, this
was for the purpose of annoying Plato, who had originally passed him
over.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">The suggestion of hostile relations is held to be
without foundation both by Tannery, <hi rend='ital'>Astronomie

introduced the fashion of arranging couches in a semicircle.

attended his lectures on the gods, the world, and the phenomena of
the heavens,

of Philistion the Sicilian.

<p>Eudoxus also left some excellent

Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Chronology.</hi> We also find
another physician of Cnidos mentioned by Eudoxus<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">The

Apollodorus, states that Eudoxus of Cnidos flourished about the
103rd Olympiad,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">368-364 b.c.</note> and that he
discovered the properties of curves. He died in his fifty-third

<p>It is said that at Memphis Eudoxus learned his coming fate from the bull with beautiful horns. No
                                words did it utter; for whence comes speech to a bull? Nature did
                                not <pb n="407"/> provide the young bull Apis with a chattering
                                tongue. But, standing sideways by him, it licked his robe, by which
                                it plainly prophesied <q>you shall soon die.</q> Whereupon, soon
                                after, this fate overtook him, when he had seen fifty-three risings
                                of the Pleiades. </p>

<p>Finally, he became a
hater of his kind and wandered on the mountains, and there he
continued to live, making his diet of grass and herbs. However, when
this gave him dropsy, he made his way back to the city and put this
riddle to the physicians, whether they were competent to create a
drought after heavy rain. They could make nothing of this, whereupon
he buried himself in a cowshed, expecting that the noxious damp
humour would be drawn out of him by the warmth of the manure. But,
as even this was of no avail, he died at the age of sixty.

body with water, quenched the light in his eyes and brought on
darkness.
</p> 
<p>Hermippus, too, says that he asked the doctors
whether anyone could by emptying the intestines draw off the
moisture; and when they said it was
<pb n='413'/>

impossible, he put himself in the sun and bade his servants
plaster him over with cow-dung. Being thus stretched and prone, he
died the next day and was buried in the market-place. Neanthes of
Cyzicus states that, being unable to tear off the dung, he remained
as he was and, being unrecognizable when so transformed, he was
devoured by dogs.

<p>As to the work which passes as his, it is a continuous treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Nature,</hi> but is divided into

                                existent things are brought into harmony by the clash of opposing
                                currents; again, all things are filled with souls and divinities.

<p>Coming now to his particular tenets, we may
state them as follows: fire is the element, all things are exchange
for fire and come into being by rarefaction and condensation<note
n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Fr. 90 D., 22 B.</note>; but of this
he gives no clear explanation. All things come into being by
conflict of opposites, and the sum of things flows like a stream.
Further, all that is is limited and forms one world. And it is
alternately born from fire and again resolved into fire in fixed
cycles to all eternity, and this is determined by destiny. Of the
opposites that which tends to birth or creation is called war and
strife, and that which tends to destruction by fire is called
concord and peace.<note n="d" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Fr. 80 D., 62

a pathway up and
down, and this determines the birth of the world.

<p>For fire by
contracting turns into moisture, and this condensing turns into
water; water again when congealed turns into earth. This process he
calls the downward path. Then again earth is liquefied, and thus
gives rise to water, and from water the rest of the series is
derived. He reduces nearly everything to exhalation from the sea.
This process is the upward path. Exhalations arise from earth as
well as from sea; those from sea are bright and pure, those from
earth dark. Fire is fed by the bright exhalations, the moist element
by the others. He does not make clear the nature of the surrounding
element. He says, however, that there are in it bowls with their
concavities turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations
collect and produce flames. These are the stars. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
    <p rend="merge">The flame of the
sun is the brightest and the hottest; the other stars are further
from the earth and for that reason give it less light and heat. The
moon, which is nearer to the earth, traverses a region which is not
pure. The sun, however, moves in a clear and untroubled region, and
keeps a proportionate distance from us. That is why it gives us more
heat and light. Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls
are turned upwards; the monthly phases of the moon are due to the
bowl turning round in its place little by little. Day and night,
months, seasons and years, rains and winds and other similar
phenomena are accounted for by the various exhalations. Thus the
bright exhalation, set aflame in the hollow orb of the sun, produces
day, the opposite exhalation when it has
<pb n='419'/> 
got
the mastery causes night; the increase of warmth due to the bright
exhalation produces summer, whereas the preponderance of moisture
due to the dark exhalation brings about winter. His explanations of
other phenomena are in harmony with this. He gives no account of the
nature of the earth, nor even of the bowls. These, then, were his
opinions.

                                There are worlds, but there is no empty space. The substance of all
                                things came from hot and cold, and dry and moist, which change into

<p>Leucippus was born at Elea, but some say at
Abdera and others at Miletus. He was a pupil of Zeno. His views were
these. The sum of things
<pb n='441'/> 
is unlimited, and they
all change into one another. The All includes the empty as well as
the full. The worlds are formed when atoms fall into the void and
are entangled with one another; and from their motion as they
increase in bulk arises the substance of the stars. The sun revolves
in a larger circle round the moon. The earth rides steadily, being
whirled about the centre; its shape is like that of a drum.
Leucippus was the first to set up atoms as first principles. Such is
a general summary of his views; on particular points they are as
follows.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
<p>He declares the All to be unlimited, as already stated; but of the All part is full and part
                                    empty,<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">By the <q>full</q> is meant
                                    matter, atoms; by the <q>empty,</q> space.</note> and these he
                                calls elements. Out of them arise the worlds unlimited in number and
                                into them they are dissolved. This is how the worlds are formed. In
                                a given section many atoms of all manner of shapes are carried from
                                the unlimited into the vast empty space. These collect together and
                                form a single vortex, in which they jostle against each other and,
                                circling round in every possible way, separate off, by like atoms
                                joining like. And, the atoms being so numerous that they can no
                                longer revolve in equilibrium, the light ones pass into the empty
                                space outside, as if they were being winnowed; the remainder keep
                                together and, becoming entangled, go on their circuit together, and
                                form a primary spherical system. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
    <p rend="merge">This
parts off like a shell, enclosing within it atoms of all kinds;
and, as these are whirled round by virtue of the resistance of the
centre, the enclosing shell becomes thinner, the adjacent atoms
continually combining when they touch the vortex.
</p> <pb n='443'/>

<p>In this way the earth is formed by portions brought to the centre
coalescing. And again, even the outer shell grows larger by the
influx of atoms from outside, and, as it is carried round in the
vortex, adds to itself whatever atoms it touches. And of these some
portions are locked together and form a mass, at first damp and
miry, but, when they have dried and revolve with the universal
vortex, they afterwards take fire and form the substance of the
stars.

<p>The orbit of the sun is the outermost, that of the moon nearest to the earth; the orbits of the
                                other heavenly bodies lie between these two. All the stars are set
                                on fire by the speed of their motion; the burning of the sun is also
                                helped by the stars; the moon is only slightly kindled. The sun and

                                rare; eclipses of the moon constantly occur, and this because their
                                orbits are unequal. As the world is born, so, too, it grows, decays
                                and perishes, in virtue of some necessity, the nature of which he

<p>Democritus was the son of Hegesistratus, though some

of Abdera or, according to some, of Miletus. He was a pupil of
certain Magians and Chaldaeans. For when King

theology and astronomy. Afterwards he met Leucippus and, according
to some, Anaxagoras, being forty years younger than the latter. But
Favorinus in his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> tells us
that Democritus, speaking of Anaxagoras, declared that his views on
the sun and the moon were not original but of great antiquity, and
that he had simply stolen them. Democritus also pulled to pieces the
views of Anaxagoras on cosmogony and on mind,</p></div>

<p>According to
Demetrius in his book on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name</hi>
and Antisthenes in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi>, he travelled into Egypt to learn geometry from
the priests, and he also went into Persia to visit the Chaldaeans as
well as to the Red Sea. Some say that he associated with the
Gymnosophists in India and went to Aethiopia. Also that, being the
third son, he divided the family property. Most authorities will
have it that he chose the smaller portion, which was in money,
because he had need of this to pay the cost of travel; besides, his
brothers were crafty enough to foresee that this would be his
choice. </p></div>

                                little room in the garden round the house and shut himself up there.
                                One day his father brought an ox to sacrifice and tied it there, and

when he returned from his travels, he was reduced to a humble mode

that the public deemed him worthy of the honour paid to a god.<note

This sentence in <hi rend='ital'>oratio recta</hi>, interrupting the

There was a law, says Antisthenes, that no one who had squandered
his patrimony should be buried in his native city. Democritus,
understanding this, and fearing lest he should be at the mercy of
any envious or unscrupulous prosecutors, read aloud to the people
his treatise, the <hi rend='ital'>Great Diacosmos</hi>, the best of
all his works; and then he was rewarded with 500 talents; and,
more than that, with bronze statues as well; and when he died, he
received a public funeral after a lifetime of more than a century. </p></div>

Amyclas and Clinias
<pb n='451'/> 
the Pythagoreans prevented
him, saying that there was no advantage in doing so, for already the
books were widely circulated. And there is clear evidence for this
in the fact that Plato, who mentions almost all the early
philosophers, never once alludes to Democritus, not even where it
would be necessary to controvert him, obviously because he knew that
he would have to match himself against the prince of philosophers,
for whom, to be sure, Timon<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 46 D.</note> has this

                                marvel at the accuracy of his observation. Moreover, Hippocrates

                                greeted her with <q>Good morning, maiden,</q> but the next day with

<p>Of the death of Democritus the account given by
Hermippus is as follows. When he was now very old and near his end,
his sister was vexed that he seemed likely to die during the
festival of Thesmophoria and she would be prevented from paying
the fitting worship to the goddess. He bade her be of good cheer and
ordered hot loaves to be brought to him every day. By applying these
to his nostrils he contrived to outlive the festival; and as soon
as the three festival days were passed he let his life go from him
without pain, having then, according to Hipparchus, attained his one
hundred and ninth year.
</p> 
<p>In my <hi rend='ital'>Pammetros</hi>
I have a piece on him as follows<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 57.</note>:
</p> 
<p>Pray who was so wise, who wrought
so vast a work as the omniscient Democritus achieved? When Death
was near, for three days he kept him in his house and regaled him
with the steam of hot loaves.

<p>Such was the life of our
philosopher.

<p>His opinions are these. The first principles of
the universe are atoms and empty space; everything else is merely
thought to exist. The worlds are unlimited; they come into being
and perish. Nothing can come into being from that which is not

<pb n='455'/> 
nor pass away into that which is not. Further, the
atoms are unlimited in size and number, and they are borne along in
the whole universe in a vortex, and therby generate all composite
things--fire, water, air, earth; for even these are conglomerations
of given atoms. And it is because of their solidity that these atoms
are impassive and unalterable. The sun and the moon have been
composed of such smooth and spherical masses [<hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> atoms], and so also the soul, which is
identical with reason. We see by virtue of the impact of images upon
our eyes.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45">
<p>All things happen by virtue of necessity, the
vortex being the cause of the creation of all things, and this he
calls necessity. The end of action is tranquillity, which is not
identical with pleasure, as some by a false interpretation have
understood, but a state in which the soul continues calm and strong,
undisturbed by any fear or superstition or any other emotion. This
he calls well-being and many other names. The qualities of things
exist merely by convention; in nature there is nothing but atoms
and void space. These, then, are his opinions.

                                Furthermore he began a work thus: <q>Man is the measure of all

                                are the obstacles that impede knowledge, both the obscurity of the

    <head>Chapter 9. DIOGENES OF APOLLONIA
<note n="c" xml:lang="eng">We naturally feel surprise when this early philosopher
is interpolated between Protagoras and Anaxarchus, both assumed to
be pupils of Democritus. The only explanation suggested is a severe
reflection on our author's acquaintance with his subject. There was
a certain Diogenes of Smyrna, an obscure adherent of the school of
Abdera. D. L., or more probably one of his authorities, has confused
this Democritean with the earlier and better-known Diogenes of
Apollonia. It is also strange that there is no Life of Metrodorus of
Chios or of Nausiphanes.</note></head>

<p>Pyrrho of Elis was the son of Pleistarchus, as Diocles relates. According to Apollodorus in his

                                Anaxarchus, whom he accompanied on his travels everywhere so that he
                                even forgathered with the Indian Gymnosophists and with the Magi.
                                This led him to adopt a most noble philosophy, to quote Ascanius of
                                Abdera, taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement.
                                He denied that anything was honourable or dishonourable, just or
                                    unjust.<note n="b"><hi rend="ital">i.e.</hi> a particular act is
                                    no more just than unjust.</note> And so, universally, he held
                                that there is nothing really existent, but custom and convention
                                govern human action; for no single thing is in itself any more this

<p>He led a life consistent with this doctrine, going out
of his way for nothing, taking no precaution, but facing all risks
as they came, whether carts, precipices, dogs or what not, and,
generally, leaving nothing to the arbitrament of the senses; but he
was kept out of harm's way by his friends who, as Antigonus of
Carystus tells us, used to follow close after him. But Aenesidemus
says that it was only his philosophy that was based upon suspension
of judgement, and that he did not lack foresight in his everyday
acts. He lived to be nearly ninety.

that such was the unperturbed state in which the wise man should

Pyrrhoneans, of course, they were called from Pyrrho. Theodosius in
his <hi rend='ital'>Sceptic Chapters</hi> denies that Scepticism
should be called Pyrrhonism; for if the movement of the mind in
either direction is unattainable by us, we shall never know for
certain what Pyrrho really intended, and without knowing that, we
cannot be called Pyrrhoneans. Besides this (he says), there is the
fact that Pyrrho was not the founder of Scepticism; nor had he any
positive tenet; but a Pyrrhonean is one who in manners and life
resembles Pyrrho.

                                its corresponding antithesis, so that after destroying others it
                                turns round and destroys itself, like a purge which drives the

<p>This the dogmatists

there is no such thing as space, and yet we have no alternative but
to speak of space for the purpose of argument, though not of

necessity and yet have to speak of necessity. This was the sort of
interpretation they used to give; though things appear to be such
and such, they are not such in reality but only appear such. And
they would say that they sought, not thoughts, since thoughts are
evidently thought, but the things in which sensation plays a

                                and these perplexities they distinguished under ten different modes
                                in which the subjects in question appeared to vary. The following
                                are the ten modes laid down.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi
                                        rend="ital">Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend="ital">Pyrrh.
                                        Hyp.</hi>i. §§ 36-163.</note>
                            </p> 
<p>The <hi rend='ital'>first</hi> mode relates to
the differences between living creatures in respect of those things
which give them pleasure or pain, or are useful or harmful to them.
By this it is inferred that they do not receive the same impressions
from the same things, with the result that such a conflict
necessarily leads to suspension of judgement. For some creatures
multiply without intercourse, for example, creatures that live in
fire, the Arabian phoenix and worms; others by union, such as man
and the rest. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80">
    <p rend="merge">Some are distinguished in one way, some in another,
and for this reason they differ in their senses also, hawks for
instance being most keen-sighted, and dogs having a most acute sense
of smell. It is natural that if the senses, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> eyes, of animals differ, so also will the
impressions produced upon them; so to the goat vine-shoots are good
to eat, to man they are bitter; the quail thrives on hemlock, which
is fatal to man; the pig will eat ordure, the horse will not.
</p>

<p>The <hi rend='ital'>second</hi> mode has reference to the natures
and idiosyncrasies of men; for instance, Demophon, Alexander's
butler, used to get warm in the shade and shiver in the sun. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81">
    <p rend="merge">Andron
of Argos is reported by Aristotle<note n="c" xml:lang="eng">Fr. 103 Rose.</note> to
have travelled across the waterless deserts of Libya without
drinking. Moreover, one man fancies the profession of medicine,
another
<pb n='495'/> 
farming, and another commerce; and the
same ways of life are injurious to one man but beneficial to
another; from which it follows that judgement must be suspended.
</p>

<p>The <hi rend='ital'>third</hi> mode depends on the differences
between the sense-channels in different cases, for an apple gives
the impression of being pale yellow in colour to the sight, sweet in
taste and fragrant in smell. An object of the same shape is made to
appear different by differences in the mirrors reflecting it. Thus
it follows that what appears is no more such and such a thing than
something different.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82">
<p>The <hi rend='ital'>fourth</hi> mode is
that due to differences of condition and to changes in general; for
instance, health, illness, sleep, waking, joy, sorrow, youth, old
age, courage, fear, want, fullness, hate, love, heat, cold, to say
nothing of breathing freely and having the passages obstructed. The
impressions received thus appear to vary according to the nature of
the conditions. Nay, even the state of madmen is not contrary to
nature; for why should their state be so more than ours? Even to our
view the sun has the appearance of standing still. And Theon of
Tithorea used to go to bed and walk in his sleep, while Pericles'
slave did the same on the housetop.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83">
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>fifth</hi> mode is derived from customs, laws, belief in
myths, compacts between nations and dogmatic assumptions. This class
includes considerations with regard to things beautiful and ugly,
true and false, good and bad, with regard to the gods, and with
regard to the coming into being and the passing away of the world of
phenomena. Obviously the same thing is regarded by some as just and
by others as unjust, or as good by some and
<pb n='497'/> 
bad
by others. Persians think it not unnatural for a man to marry his
daughter; to Greeks it is unlawful. The Massagetae, acording to
Eudoxus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Voyage round the
World</hi>, have their wives in common; the Greeks have not. The
Cilicians used to delight in piracy; not so the Greeks. </p></div>

people believe in different gods; some in providence, others not.
In burying their dead, the Egyptians embalm them; the Romans burn
them; the Paeonians throw them into lakes. As to what is true,
then, let suspension of judgement be our practice.
</p> 
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>sixth</hi> mode relates to mixtures and participations, by virtue of which nothing appears pure in and by itself, but
only in combination with air, light, moisture, solidity, heat, cold,
movement, exhalations and other forces. For purple shows different
tints in sunlight, moonlight, and lamplight; and our own
complexion does not appear the same at noon and when the sun is low. </p></div>

about in water, either because, being in reality heavy, it is lifted
by the water or because, being light, it is made heavy by the air.
Of its own inherent property we know nothing, any more than of the
constituent oils in an ointment.
</p> 
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>seventh</hi> mode has reference to distances, positions,
places and the occupants of the places. In this mode things which
are thought to be large appear small, square things round; flat
things appear to have projections, straight things to be bent, and
colourless coloured. So the sun, on account of its distance, appears
small, mountains when far away appear misty and smooth, but when
near at hand
<pb n='499'/> 
rugged. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86">
    <p rend="merge">Furthermore, the sun at
its rising has a certain appearance, but has a dissimilar appearance
when in mid-heaven, and the same body one appearance in a wood and
another in open country. The image again varies according to the
position of the object, and a dove's neck according to the way it is
turned. Since, then, it is not possible to observe these things
apart from places and positions, their real nature is
unknowable.
</p> 
<p>The <hi rend='ital'>eighth</hi> mode is concerned
with quantities and qualities of things, say heat or cold, swiftness
or slowness, colourlessness or variety of colours. Thus wine taken
in moderation strengthens the body, but too much of it is weakening; 
and so with food and other things.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87">
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>ninth</hi> mode has to do with perpetuity, strangeness, or rarity. Thus earthquakes are no surprise to those among
whom they constantly take place; nor is the sun, for it is seen
every day.<note n="a" xml:lang="eng">As contrasted, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>, with
a comet; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh.

and tenth by Sextus and Aenesidemus; moreover the tenth is put
eighth by Sextus and ninth by Favorinus.
</p> 
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>tenth</hi> mode rests on inter-relation, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> between light and heavy, strong and weak,
greater and less, up and down. Thus that which is on the right is

the thing is no longer on the right. </p></div>

other modes, resulting respectively from disagreement, extension

with regard to any inquiry whether in philosophy or in everyday
life, that it is full of the utmost contentiousness and confusion.
The mode which involves extension <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>
refuses to admit that what is sought to be proved is firmly

else. Hence all things are unknowable. The mode resulting from
hypothesis arises when people suppose that you must take the most
elementary of things as of themselves entitled to credence, instead
of postulating them: which is useless, because some one else will
adopt the contrary hypothesis. The mode arising from reciprocal
inference is found whenever that which should be confirmatory of the
thing requiring to be proved itself has to borrow credit from the
latter, as, for example, if anyone seeking to establish the
existence of pores on the ground that emanations take place should
take this (the existence of pores) as proof that there are
emanations.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">This is what is commonly called arguing in a

four from the fact that the elements are four. Besides, if we
discredit particular demonstrations, we cannot accept the
generalization from them. And in order that we may know that an
argument constitutes a demonstration, we require a criterion; but
again, in order that we may know that it is a criterion we require a
demonstration; hence both the one and the other are
incomprehensible, since each is referred to the other. How then are
we to grasp the things which are uncertain, seeing that we know no
demonstration? For what we wish to ascertain is not whether
things appear to be such and such, but whether they are so in their
essence.
</p> 
<p>They declared the dogmatic philosophers to be fools,

in a certain disposition and in a certain reciprocal relation to
surrounding circumstances. Therefore we must affirm either that
all
<pb n='505'/> 
things are true or that all things are
false. For if certain things only are true [and others are false],
how are we to distinguish them?  Not by the senses, where things in
the field of sense are in question, since all these things appear to
sense to be on an equal footing; nor by the mind, for the same
reason. Yet apart from these faculties there is no other, so far as
we can see, to help us to a judgement. Whoever therefore, they say,
would be firmly assured about anything sensible or intelligible must
first establish the received opinions about it; for some have
refuted one doctrine, others another. But things must be judged
either by the sensible or by the intelligible,</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93">
    <p rend="merge">and both are
disputed. Therefore it is impossible to pronounce judgement on
opinions about sensibles or intelligibles; and if the conflict in
our thoughts compels us to disbelieve every one, the standard or
measure, by which it is held that all things are exactly determined,
will be destroyed, and we must deem every statement of equal value.
Further, say they, our partner in an inquiry into a phenomenon is
either to be trusted or not. If he is, he will have nothing to reply
to the man to whom it appears to be the opposite<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi

him is to be trusted, so is his opponent. If he is not to be

<p>We must not assume that what convinces us is

<p>Again, they
would destroy the criterion by reasoning of this kind. Even the
criterion has either been critically determined or not. If it has
not, it is definitely untrustworthy, and in its purpose of
distinguishing is no more true than false. If it has, it will belong
to the class of particular judgements, so that one and the same
thing determines and is determined, and the criterion which has
determined will have to be determined by another, that other by
another, and so on <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> </p></div>

this there is disagreement as to the criterion, some holding that
man is the criterion, while for some it is the senses, for others

with man and with himself, as is shown by differences of laws and
customs. The senses deceive, and reason says different things.
Finally, the apprehensive presentation is judged by the mind, and
the mind itself changes in various ways. Hence the criterion is
unknowable, and consequently truth also.

<p>They deny, too, that there is such a thing as a sign. If there is, they say, it must either be
                                sensible or intelligible. Now it is not sensible, because what is
                                sensible is a common attribute, whereas a sign is a particular
                                thing. Again, the sensible is one of the things which exist by way
                                of difference, while the sign belongs to the category of relative.
                                Nor is a sign an object of thought, for objects of thought are of
                                four kinds, apparent judgements on things apparent, non-apparent

                                apparent on non-apparent; and a sign is none of these, so <pb

                                nor is it non-apparent on non-apparent, for what is revealed by
                                something must needs appear; nor is it non-apparent on apparent,
                                for that which is to afford the means of apprehending something else
                                must itself be apparent;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97">
    <p rend="merge">nor, lastly, is it apparent on
non-apparent, because the sign, being relative, must be apprehended
along with that of which it is the sign, which is not here the case.
It follows that nothing uncertain can be apprehended; for it is
through signs that uncertain things are said to be apprehended.<note
n='a'>This conclusion would debar us from all extension of knowledge
beyond what is apparent here and now; whereas the dogmatists permit

</p> 
<p>Causes, too, they
destroy in this way. A cause is something relative; for it is
relative to what can be caused, namely, the effect. But things which
are relative are merely objects of thought and have no substantial
existence. </p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98">
    <p rend="merge">Therefore a cause can only be an object of thought;
inasmuch as, if it be a cause, it must bring with it that of which
it is said to be the cause, otherwise it will not be a cause. Just
as a father, in the absence of that in relation to which he is
called father, will not be a father, so too with a cause. But that
in relation to which the cause is thought of, namely the effect, is
not present; for there is no coming into being or passing away or
any other process: therefore there is no such thing as cause.
Furthermore, if there is a cause, either bodies are the cause of
bodies, or things incorporeal of things incorporeal; but neither is
the case; therefore there is no such thing as cause. Body in fact
could not be the cause of body, inasmuch as both have the same
nature. And if either is
<pb n='511'/> 
called a cause in so
far as it is a body, the other, being a body, will become a cause. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99">
    <p rend="merge">But if both be alike causes, there will be nothing to be acted upon
Nor can an incorporeal thing be the cause of an incorporeal thing,
for the same reason. And a thing incorporeal cannot be the cause of
a body, since nothing incorporeal creates anything corporeal. And,
lastly, a body cannot be the cause of anything incorporeal, because
what is produced must be of the material operated upon; but if it
is not operated upon because it is incorporeal, it cannot be
produced by anything whatever. Therefore there is no such thing as a
cause. A corollary to this is their statement that the first
principles of the universe have no real existence; for in that case
something must have been there to create and act.
</p> 
<p>Furthermore
there is no motion; for that which moves moves either in the place
where it is or in a place where it is not. But it cannot move in the
place where it is, still less in any place where it is not.
Therefore there is no such thing as motion.

<p>They used also to
deny the possibility of learning. If anything is taught, they say,

apparent to and recognized by all; nor is the non-existent taught
through the nonexistent, for with the non-existent nothing is ever

common; therefore there is no such thing as good or bad by nature.
For either all that is thought good by anyone whatever must be
called good, or not all. Certainly all cannot be so called; since
one and the same thing is thought good by one person and bad by
another; for instance, Epicurus thought pleasure good and
Antisthenes thought it bad; thus on our supposition it will follow
that the same thing is both good and bad. But if we say that not all
that anyone thinks good is good, we shall have to judge the
different opinions; and this is impossible because of the equal
validity of opposing arguments. Therefore the good by nature is
unknowable.

Chalcedon as a sophist, he increased his reputation still further
and, having made his fortune, went to Athens, where he lived until

<p>Now this philosopher, according to Antigonus, was very fond of gardens and preferred to mind his

                                which he replied, <q>You can, if you get hold of the ancient

meeting troubles and death, as Epicurus declares in the first book
of his memoir. He died, we learn, seven years before Epicurus in his
fiftythird year, and Epicurus himself in his will already cited
clearly speaks of him as departed, and enjoins upon his executors to
make provision for Metrodorus's children. The above-mentioned
Timocrates<note n="c" xml:lang="eng">This second mention of Timocrates (see § 6) may

<p>He died of paralysis, but not till he had given

Lampsacus and his wife Themista, to whom Epicurus wrote letters;

succeeded by Dionysius, and he by Basilides. Apollodorus, known as

<p>There were three other men who bore the name
of Epicurus: one the son of Leonteus and Themista; another a
Magnesian by birth; and a third, a drillsergeant.
</p> 
<p>Epicurus was a most prolific author and eclipsed all before him in the number of his writings:
                                for they amount to about three hundred rolls, and contain not a
                                single citation from other authors; it is Epicurus himself who
                                speaks throughout. Chrysippus tried to outdo him in authorship
                                according to Carneades, who therefore calls him the literary
                                parasite of Epicurus. <q>For every subject treated by Epicurus,
                                Chrysippus in his contentiousness must treat at equal length;</q></p></div>

</p> 
<p>The first
epistle is addressed to Herodotus and deals with physics; the
second to Pythocles and deals with astronomy or meteorology; the
third is addressed to Menoeceus and its subject is human life. We
must begin with the first after some few preliminary remarks<note

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
    <p rend="merge">Canonic forms the introduction to

The ethical part deals with the facts of choice and aversion: this
may be found in the books <hi rend='ital'>On Human Life</hi>, in the
letters, and in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>Of the End.</hi> The
usual arrangement, however, is to conjoin canonic with physics, and
the former they call the science which deals with the standard and
the first principle, or the elementary part of philosophy, while
physics proper, they say, deals with becoming and perishing and with
nature; ethics, on the other

things to be sought and avoided, with human life and with the

<p>By preconception they mean a sort of apprehension or a right opinion or notion, or universal idea
                                stored in the mind; that is, a recollection of an external object
                                often presented, <hi rend="ital">e.g.</hi> Such and such a thing is
                                a man: for no sooner is the word <q>man</q> uttered than we think
                                of his shape by an act of preconception, in which the senses take
                                the lead.<note n="b" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend="ital">i.e.</hi> in
                                    conformity with the sense-data which precede the

                                term is then plain and clear. And we should never have started an
                                investigation, unless we had known what it was that we were in
                                search of. For example: The object standing yonder is a horse or a
                                cow. Before making this judgement, we must at some time or other
                                have known by preconception the shape of a horse or a cow. We should
                                not have given anything a name, if we had not first learnt its form
                                by way of preconception. It follows, then, that preconceptions are
                                clear. The object of a judgement is derived from something
                                previously clear, by reference to which we frame the proposition,

the facts invite us to give a plurality of explanations. Lightnings
too happen in a variety of ways. For when the clouds rub against

of fire generates lightning; or it may be due to the flashing forth
from the clouds, by reason of winds, of particles capable of
producing this brightness; or else it is squeezed out of the clouds
when they have been condensed either by their own action or by that
of the winds; or again, the light diffused from the stars may be
enclosed in the clouds, then driven about by their motion and by
that of the winds, and finally make its escape from the clouds; or
light of the finest texture may be filtered through the clouds
(whereby the clouds may be set on fire and thunder produced), and
the motion of this light may make lightning; or it may arise from
the combustion of wind brought about by the violence of its motion
and the intensity of its compression;</q></p></div>

these likewise cause lightning to appear. And it may easily be seen
that its occurrence is possible in many other ways, so long as we
hold fast to facts and take a general view of what is analogous to
them. Lightning precedes thunder, when the clouds are constituted as
mentioned above and the configuration which produces lightning is
expelled at the moment when the wind falls upon the cloud, and

the wind being rolled up afterwards produces the
roar of thunder; or, if both are simultaneous, the lightning moves

repeatedly collected, imprisoned, and violently ignited; or when a
part is torn asunder and is more violently expelled downwards, the
rending being due to the fact that the compression of the clouds has
made the neighbouring parts more dense; or again it may be due like
thunder merely to the expulsion of the imprisoned fire, when this
has accumulated and been more violently inflated with wind and has
torn the cloud, being unable to withdraw to the adjacent parts
because it is continually more and more closely
compressed--[generally by some high mountain where thunderbolts
mostly fall]. </q></p></div>

that part where they are seen to be. Moreover there are several
other ways in which this might be brought about, as may be seen by

accounted for by saying that they originally moved in a circle and

but it may also be that according to the diversity of the regions
traversed in some places there are uniform tracts of air, forcing
them forward in one direction and burning uniformly, in others these
tracts present such irregularities as cause the motions observed. To
assign a single cause for these effects when the facts suggest
several causes is madness and a strange inconsistency; yet it is
done by adherents of rash astronomy, who assign meaningless

that they are drawn back by the same whirling motion and move in the

Menoeceus come excerpts (§§ 117-120) dealing with the wise man as
conceived by Epicurus, to which are added (§§ 120, 121) some ethical
tenets.</note> Before quoting his words, however, let me go into the
views of Epicurus himself and his school concerning the wise
man.
</p> 
<p>There are three motives to injurious acts among
men--hatred, envy, and contempt; and these the wise man overcomes
by reason. Moreover, he who has once become wise never more assumes
the opposite habit, not even in semblance, if he can help it. He
will be more susceptible of emotion than other men: that will be no
hindrance to his wisdom. However, not every bodily constitution nor
every nationality would permit a man to become wise.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118">
<p>Even on the rack the wise man is happy. He alone will
feel gratitude towards friends, present and absent alike, and show
it by word and deed. When on the rack, however, he will give vent to
cries and groans. As regards women he will submit to the
restrictions imposed by the law, as Diogenes says in his epitome of
Epicurus' ethical doctrines. Nor will he punish his servants;
rather he will pity them and make allowance on occasion for those
who are of good character. The Epicureans do not suffer the wise man
to fall in love; nor will he trouble himself about funeral rites;
according to them love does not come by divine inspiration: so
Diogenes in his twelfth book. The wise man will not make fine
speeches. No one was ever the better for sexual indulgence, and it
is well if he be not the worse.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119">
<p>Nor, again, will the wise man
marry and rear a family: so Epicurus says in the <hi

Occasionally he may marry owing to special circumstances in his
life. Some too will turn aside from their purpose. Nor will he
drivel, when drunken: so Epicurus says in the <hi
rend='ital'>Symposium.</hi> Nor will he take part in politics, as is
stated in the first book <hi rend='ital'>On Life</hi>; nor will he
make himself a tyrant; nor will he turn Cynic (so the second book
<hi rend='ital'>On Life</hi> tells us) ; nor will he be a mendicant.
But even when he has lost his sight, he will not withdraw
himself<note n="a" xml:lang="eng"><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> by suicide, as
recommended by the Stoics (<hi rend='ital'>supra</hi>, vii.
130).</note> from life: this is stated in the same book. The wise

Whether he is well off or not will be matter of indifference to him.
Only the wise man will be able to converse correctly about music and
poetry, without however actually writing poems himself. One wise man
does not move more wisely than another. And he will make money, but
only by his wisdom, if he should be in poverty, and he will pay
court to a king, if need be. He will be grateful to anyone when he
is corrected. He will found a school, but not in such a manner as to
draw the crowd after him; and will give readings in public, but
only by request. He will be a dogmatist but not a mere sceptic; and
he will be like himself even when asleep. And he will on occasion
die for a friend.
</p> 
<p>The school holds that sins are not all
equal; that health is in some cases a good, in others a thing
indifferent; that courage is not a natural gift but comes from
calculation of expediency; and that friendship is prompted by our
needs. One of the friends, however, must make the first advances
(just as we have to cast seed into the earth), but it is maintained
by a partnership in the enjoyment of life's pleasures.

                                is grown old. For no age is too early or too late for the health of
                                the soul. And to say that the season for studying philosophy has not

                                season for happiness is not yet or that it is now no more.
                                Therefore, both old and young ought to seek wisdom, the former in
                                order that, as age comes over him, he may be young in good things

                                while he is young, he may at the same time be old, because he has no

                                First believe that God is a living being immortal and blessed,
                                according to the notion of a god indicated by the common sense of

                                is foreign to his immortality or that agrees not with blessedness,
                                but shalt believe about him whatever may uphold both his blessedness
                                and his immortality. For verily there are gods, and the knowledge of

                                seeing that men do not steadfastly maintain the notions they form
                                respecting them. Not the man who denies the gods worshipped by the

causes no annoyance when it is present, causes only a groundless
pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of

delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life;
it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and
avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest
tumults take possession of the soul. Of all this the beginning and
the greatest good is prudence. Wherefore prudence is a more
precious thing even than philosophy; from it spring all the other
virtues, for it teaches that we cannot lead a life of pleasure which
is not also a life of prudence, honour, and justice; nor lead a
life of prudence, honour, and justice, which is not also a life of

<p>He further disagrees
with the Cyrenaics in that they hold that pains of body are worse
than mental pains; at all events evil-doers are made to suffer
bodily punishment; whereas Epicurus holds the pains of the mind to
be the worse; at any rate the flesh endures the storms of the
present alone, the mind those of the past and future as well as the
present. In this way also he holds mental pleasures to be
</p> <pb

<p>greater than those of the body. And as proof that
pleasure is the end he adduces the fact that living things, so soon
as they are born, are well content with pleasure and are at enmity
with pain, by the prompting of nature and apart from reason. Left to
our own feelings, then, we shun pain; as when even Heracles,
devoured by the poisoned robe, cries aloud,

choose the virtues too on account of pleasure and not for their own

Sovran Maxims,<note n="b" xml:lang="eng">This collection of forty of the most
important articles of faith in the Epicurean creed was famous in
antiquity. It consists of extracts from the voluminous writings of
Epicurus, and may have been put together by a faithful disciple. On
the other hand, Epicurus laid great stress (§§35, 36) on epitomes of
his doctrine being committed to memory; so that his passion for
personal direction and supervision of the studies of his pupils may
have induced him to furnish them with such an indispensable
catechism.</note> therewith bringing the whole work to a close and

<p>1. A blessed and eternal being has no trouble
himself and brings no trouble upon any other being; hence he is
exempt from movements of anger and partiality, for every such
movement implies weakness [<hi rend='ital'>Elsewhere he says that

<p>2.
Death is nothing to us; for the body, when it has been resolved
into its elements, has no feeling, and that which has no feeling is
nothing to us.
</p> 
<p>3. The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit
in the removal of all pain. When pleasure is present, so long as it
is uninterrupted, there is no pain either of body or of mind or of
both together.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140">
<p>4. Continuous pain does not last long in the
flesh; on the contrary, pain, if extreme, is present a very short
time, and even that degree of pain which barely outweighs pleasure
in the flesh does not last for many days together. Illnesses of long
duration even permit of an excess of pleasure over pain in the
flesh.
</p> 
<p>5. It is impossible to live a pleasant life without
living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live
wisely and well and justly without living pleasantly. Whenever any
one of these is lacking, when, for instance, the man is not able to
live wisely, though he lives well and justly, it is impossible for
him to live a pleasant life.

<p>7. Some men have sought to become famous and renowned, thinking
that thus they would make themselves secure against their

they attained natural good; if, however, it was insecure, they have
not attained the end which by nature's own prompting they originally

<p>9. If all
pleasure had been capable of accumulation,--if this had gone on
not only by recurrence in time, but all over the frame or, at any
rate, over the principal parts of man's nature, there would never
have been any difference between one pleasure and another, as in
fact there is.
</p> 
<p>10. If the objects which are productive of
pleasures to profligate persons really freed them from fears of the
mind,--the fears, I mean, inspired by celestial and atmospheric
phenomena, the fear of death, the fear of pain; if, further, they
taught them to limit their desires, we should never have any fault
to find with such persons, for they would then be filled with
pleasures to overflowing on all sides and would be exempt from all
pain, whether of body or mind, that is, from all evil.
</p> 
<p>11. If
we had never been molested by alarms at celestial and atmospheric

Fortune but seldom interferes with the wise man; his greatest and
highest interests have been, are, and will be, directed by reason
throughout the course of his life.

<p>17. The just man enjoys
the greatest peace of mind, while the unjust is full of the utmost
disquietude.
</p> 
<p>18. Pleasure in the flesh admits no increase
when once the pain of want has been removed; after that it only
admits of variation. The limit of pleasure in the mind, however, is
reached when we reflect on the things themselves and their congeners
which cause the mind the greatest alarms.

and limited time afford an equal amount of pleasure, if we measure

as unlimited the limits of pleasure; and to provide it requires
unlimited time. But the mind, grasping in thought what the end and
limit of the flesh is, and banishing the terrors of futurity,
procures a complete and perfect life, and has no longer any need of
unlimited time. Nevertheless it does not shun pleasure, and even
in the
<pb n='671'/> 
hour of death, when ushered out of
existence by circumstances, the mind does not lack enjoyment of the
best life.

<p>22. We must take into account as the end all that
really exists and all clear evidence of sense to which we refer our
opinions; for otherwise everything will be full of uncertainty and
confusion.
</p> 
<p>23. If you fight against all your sensations, you

If you reject absolutely any single sensation without stopping to
discriminate with respect to that which awaits confirmation between
matter of opinion and that which is already present, whether in
sensation or in feelings or in any presentative perception of the
mind, you will throw into confusion even the rest of your sensations
by your groundless belief and so you will be rejecting the standard
of truth altogether. If in your ideas based upon opinion you
hastily affirm as true all that awaits confirmation as well as that
which does not, you will not escape error, as you will be
maintaining complete ambiguity whenever it is a case of judging
between right and wrong opinion.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148">
<p>25. If you do not on every
separate occasion refer each of your actions to the end prescribed

<p>26. All such desires as
lead to no pain when they remain ungratified are unnecessary, and
the longing is easily got rid of, when the thing desired is
difficult to procure or when the desires seem likely to produce
harm.
</p> 
<p>27. Of all the means which are procured by wisdom to
ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most
important is the acquisition of friends.
</p> 
<p>28. The same
conviction which inspires confidence that nothing we have to fear is
eternal or even of long duration, also enables us to see that even
in our limited conditions of life nothing enhances our security so
much as friendship.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
<p>29. Of our desires some are natural and
necessary; others are natural, but not necessary; others, again,
are neither natural nor necessary, but are due to illusory opinion.
[Epicurus regards as natural and necessary desires which bring
relief from pain, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> drink when we are
thirsty; while by natural and not necessary he means those which
merely diversify the pleasure without removing the pain, as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> costly viands; by the neither natural nor
necessary he means desires for crowns and the erection of statues in
one's honour.--Schol.]
</p> 
<p>30. Those natural desires which entail
no pain when not gratified, though their objects are vehemently
pursued, are also due to illusory opinion; and when they are not
got rid of, it is not because of their own nature, but because of
the man's illusory opinion.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150">
<p>31. Natural justice is a symbol
or expression of
<pb n='675'/> 
expediency, to prevent one man
from harming or being harmed by another.

<p>32. Those animals
which are incapable of making covenants with one another, to the end
that they may neither inflict nor suffer harm, are without either
justice or injustice. And those tribes which either could not or
would not form mutual covenants to the same end are in like
case.
</p> 
<p>33. There never was an absolute justice, but only an
agreement made in reciprocal intercourse in whatever localities
now and again from time to time, providing against the infliction or
suffering of harm.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151">
<p>34. Injustice is not in itself an evil,
but only in its consequence, viz. the terror which is excited by
apprehension that those appointed to punish such offences will
discover the injustice.
</p> 
<p>35. It is impossible for the man who
secretly violates any article of the social compact to feel
confident that he will remain undiscovered, even if he has already
escaped ten thousand times; for right on to the end of his life he
is never sure he will not be detected.
</p> 
<p>36. Taken generally,
justice is the same for all, to wit, something found expedient in
mutual intercourse; but in its application to particular cases of
locality or conditions of whatever kind, it varies under different
circumstances.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152">
<p>37. Among the things accounted just by conventional law, whatever in the needs of mutual intercourse is
attested to be expedient, is thereby stamped as just, whether or not
it be the same for all; and in case any law is made and does not
prove suitable to the expediencies of mutual intercourse, then this
is
<pb n='677'/> 
no longer just. And should the expediency
which is expressed by the law vary and only for a time correspond
with the prior conception, nevertheless for the time being it was
just, so long as we do not trouble ourselves about empty words, but
look simply at the facts.
</p></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153">
<p>38. Where without any change in
circumstances the conventional laws, when judged by their consequences, were seen not to correspond with the notion of justice,
such laws were not really just; but wherever the laws have ceased
to be expedient in consequence of a change in circumstances, in that
case the laws were for the time being just when they were expedient
for the mutual intercourse of the citizens, and subsequently ceased
to be just when they ceased to be expedient.

knew how to meet fear of external foes made into one family all the

treat as aliens; and where he found even this impossible, he
avoided all intercourse, and, so far as was expedient, kept them
at a distance.
</p> 
<p>40. Those who were best able to provide themselves with the means of security against their neighbours, being
thus in possession of the surest guarantee, passed the most
agreeable life in each other's society; and their enjoyment of the
fullest intimacy was such that, if one of them died before his time,
the survivors did not lament his death as if it called for
