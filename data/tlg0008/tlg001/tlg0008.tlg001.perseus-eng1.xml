            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE author of the DEIPNOSOPHISTS was an Egyptian, born in Naucratis, a town on the
               left side of the Canopic Mouth of the Nile. The age in which he lived is somewhat
               uncertain, but his work, at least the latter portion of it, must have been written
               after the death of Ulpian the lawyer, which happened A. D. 228.</p>
            <p>Athenæus appears to have been imbued with a great love of learning, in the pursuit of
               which he indulged in the most extensive and multifarious reading; and the principal
               value of his work is, that by its copious quotations it preserves to us large
               fragments from the ancient poets, which would otherwise have perished. There are also
               one or two curious and interesting extracts in prose; such, for instance, as the
               account of the gigantic ship built by Ptolemæus Philopator, extracted from a lost
               work of Callixenus of Rhodes.</p>
            <p>The work commences, in imitation of Plato's Phædo, with a dialogue, in which Athenæus
               and Timocrates supply the place of Phædo and Echecrates. The former relates to his
               friend the conversation which passed at a banquet given at the house of Laurentius, a
               noble Roman, between some of the guests, the best known of whom are Galen and
               Ulpian.</p>
            <pb n="v.1.p.iv"/>
            <p>The first two books, and portions of the third, eleventh, and fifteenth, exist only
               in an Epitome, of which both the date and author are unknown. It soon, however,
               became more common than the original work, and eventually in a great degree
               superseded it. Indeed Bentley has proved that the only knowledge which, in the time
               of Eustathius, existed of Athenæus, was through its medium.</p>
            <p>Athenæus was also the author of a book entitled, <quote>On the Kings of
                  Syria,</quote> of which no portion has come down to us.</p>

               <p>ATHENAEUS is the author of this book; and in it he is discoursing with Timocrates:
                  and the name of the book is the Deipnosophists. In this work Laurentius is
                  introduced, a Roman, a man of distinguished fortune, giving a banquet in his own
                  house to men of the highest eminence for every kind of learning and
                  accomplishment; and there is no sort of gentlemanly knowledge which he does not
                  mention in the conversation which he attributes to them; for he has put down in
                  his book, fish, and their uses, and the meaning of their names; and he has
                  described divers kinds of vegetables, and animals of all sorts. He has introduced
                  also men who have written histories, and poets, and, in short, clever men of all
                  sorts; and he discusses musical instruments, and quotes ten thousand jokes: he
                  talks of the different kinds of drinking cups, and of the riches of kings, and the
                  size of ships, and numbers of other things which I cannot easily enumerate, and
                  the day would fail me if I endeavoured to go through them separately.</p>
               <p>And the arrangement of the conversation is an imitation of a sumptuous banquet;
                  and the plan of the book follows the arrangement of the conversation. This, then,
                  is the delicious feast of words which this admirable master of the <pb n="v.1.p.2"/> feast, Athenæus, has prepared for us; and gradually sur- passing
                  himself, like the orator at Athens, as he warms with his subject, he bounds on
                  towards the end of the book in noble strides.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="2">
               <p>And the Deipnosophists who were present at this banquet were, <hi rend="italics">Masyrius,</hi> an expounder of the law, and one who had been no superficial
                  student of every sort of learning; <hi rend="italics">Magnus</hi>. . . .
                  [Myrtilus] a poet, a man who in other branches of learning was inferior to no one,
                  and who had devoted himself in no careless manner to the whole circle of arts and
                  learning; for in everything which he discussed, he appeared as if that was the
                  sole thing which he had studied; so great and so various was his learning from his
                  childhood. And he was an iambic poet, inferior to no one who has ever lived since
                  the time of Archilochus. There were present also <hi rend="italics">Plutarchus,
                     and Leonidas</hi> of Elis, and <hi rend="italics">Aemilianus</hi> the
                  Mauritanian, and <hi rend="italics">Zöilus,</hi> all the most admirable of
                  grammarians.</p>
               <p>And of philosophers there were present <hi rend="italics">Pontianus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Democritus,</hi> both of Nicomedia; men superior to all their
                  contemporaries in the extent and variety of their learning; and <hi rend="italics">Philadelphus</hi> of Ptolemais, a man who had not only been bred up from his
                  infancy in philosophical speculation, but who was also a man of the highest
                  reputation in every part of his life. Of the Cynics, there was one whom he calls
                     <hi rend="italics">Cynulcus,</hi> who had not only two white dogs following
                  him, as they did Telemachus when he went to the assembly, but a more numerous pack
                  than even Actæon had. And of rhetoricians there was a whole troop, in no respect
                  inferior to the Cynics. And these last, as well, indeed, as every one else who
                  ever opened his mouth, were run down by <hi rend="italics">Uppianus</hi> the
                  Tyrian, who, on account of the everlasting questions which he keeps putting every
                  hour in the streets, and walks, and booksellers' shops, and baths, has got a name
                  by which he is better known than by his real one, <hi rend="italics">Ceitouceitus.</hi> This man had a rule of his own, to eat nothing without
                  saying <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεῖται</foreign>; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ οὐ
                     κεῖται</foreign>; In this way, <quote>Can we say of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥρα</foreign> that it <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεῖται,</foreign>
                     or is applicable to any part of the day? And is the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέθυσος,</foreign> or drunk, applicable to a man? Can the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήτρα,</foreign> or paunch, be applied to any eatable food? Is
                     the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύαγρος</foreign> a compound word applicable to
                     a boar?</quote>—And of physicians there were present <hi rend="italics">Daphnus</hi>
                  <pb n="v.1.p.3"/> the Ephesian, a man holy both in his art and by his manners, a
                  man of no slight insight into the principles of the Academic school; and <hi rend="italics">Galenus</hi> of Pergamos, who has published such numbers of
                  philosophical and medical works as to surpass all those who preceded him, and who
                  is inferior to none of the guests in the eloquence of his descriptions. And <hi rend="italics">Rufinus</hi> of Mylæa.—And of musicians, <hi rend="italics">Alcides</hi> of Alexandria, was present. So that the whole party was so
                  numerous that the catalogue looks rather like a muster-roll of soldiers, than the
                  list of a dinner party.</p>

               <p>And Athenæus dramatises his dialogue in imitation of the manner of Plato. And thus
                  he begins:—</p>

                  <hi rend="italics">Tim.</hi> Were you, Athenæus, yourself present at that

                  much talked of all over the city; or is it only from having heard an account of it
                  from others that you spoke of it to your companions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Ath.</hi> I was there myself, Timocrates.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="4">
               <p>Then after a little while he proceeds to the praises of Laurentius, and says that
                  he, being a man of a munificent spirit, and one who collected numbers of learned
                  men about him, feasted them not only with other things, but also with
                  conversation, at one time proposing questions deserving of investigation, and at
                  another asking for information himself; not suggesting subjects without
                  examination, or in any random manner, but as far as was possible with a critical
                  and Socratic discernment; so that every one marvelled at the systematic character
                  of his questions. And he says, too, that he was appointed superintendant of the
                  temples and sacrifices by that best of all sovereigns Marcus;<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Marcus Aurelius.</note> and that he was no
                  less conversant with the literature of the Greeks than with that of <pb n="v.1.p.4"/> his own countrymen. And he calls him a sort of Asteropæus,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Asteropæus was one of the Trojan heroes who
                     endeavoured to fight Achilles, being armed with two spears.</note> equally
                  acquainted with both languages. And he says that he was well versed in all the
                  religious ceremonies instituted by Romulus, who gave his name to the city, and by
                  Numa Pompilius; and that he is learned in all the laws of politics; and that he
                  has arrived at all this learning solely from the study of ancient decrees and
                  resolutions; and from the collection of the laws which (as Eupolis, the comic
                  writer, says of the poems of Pindar) are already reduced to silence by the
                  disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning. He had also, says he, such a
                  library of ancient Greek books, as to exceed in that respect all those who are
                  remarkable for such collections; such as Polycrates of Samos, and Pisistratus who
                  was tyrant of Athens, and Euclides who was himself also an Athenian, and
                  Nicorrates the Samian, and even the kings of Pergamos, and Euripides the poet, and
                  Aristotle the philosopher, and Nelius his librarian; from whom they say that our
                  countryman Ptolemæus, surnamed Philadelphus, bought them all, and transported them
                  with all those which he had collected at Athens and at Rhodes to his own beautiful
                  Alexandria. So that a man may fairly quote the verses of Antiphanes and apply them
                  to him:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You court the heav'nly muse with ceaseless zeal,</l>
                     <l>And seek to open all the varied stores</l>
                     <l>Of high philosophy.</l>
                  </quote> And as the Theban lyric poet<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pindar. Ol. i. 22.—See Moore's translation.</note> says:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Nor less renown'd his hand essays</l>
                     <l>To wake the muse's choicest lays,</l>

                     <l>Full oft our tuneful band inspire.</l>
                  </quote> And when inviting people to his feasts, he causes Rome to be looked upon
                  as the common country of all of them. For who can regret what he has left in his
                  own country, while dwelling with a man who thus opens his house to all his
                  friends. For as Apollodorus the comic poet says:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  which Dionysius laughed, and sent him the mullet which had been set before
                  himself. And Dionysius was very fond of drinking with Philoxenus, but when he
                  detected him in trying to seduce Galatea, whom he himself was in love with, he
                  threw him into the stone quarries; and while there he wrote the Cyclops,
                  constructing the fable with reference to what had happened to himself;
                  representing Dionysius as the Cyclops, and the flute-player as Galatea, and
                  himself as Ulysses.</p>

               <p>About the time of Tiberius there lived a man named Apicius; very rich and
                  luxurious; from whom several kinds of cheesecakes are called Apician. He spent
                  myriads of drachms on his belly, living chiefly at Minturnæ, a city of Campania,
                  eating very expensive crawfish, which are found in that place superior in size to
                  those of Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing too that they were
                  very large in Africa, he sailed thither, without waiting a single day, and
                  suffered exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the place, before he
                  disembarked from the ship, (for his arrival made a great noise among the
                  Africans,) the fishermen came alongside in their boats and brought him some very
                  fine crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had any finer; and when
                  they said that there were none finer than those which they brought, he,
                  recollecting those at Minturnæ, ordered the master of the ship to sail back the
                  same way into Italy, without going near the land. But Aristoxenus, <pb n="v.1.p.11"/> the philosopher of Cyrene, a real devotee of the philosophy of
                  his country, (from whom, hams cured in particular way are called Aristoxeni,) out
                  of his prodigious luxury used to syringe the lettuces which grew in his garden
                  with mead in the evening, and then, when he picked them in the morning, he would
                  say that he was eating green cheesecakes, which were sent up to him by the

               <p>When the emperor Trajan was in Parthia, at a distance of many days' journey from
                  the sea, Apicius sent him fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever

                  of Nicomedes, king of the Bithynians, made in imitation of the real fish, and set
                  before the king, when he expressed a wish for anchovies, (and he too at the time

               <p>Dioscorides, with respect to the laws praised in Homer, says, "The poet, seeing
                  that temperance was the most desirable virtue for young men, and also the first of
                  all virtues, and one which was becoming to every one; and that which, as it were,
                  was the guide to all other virtues, wishing to implant it from the very beginning
                  in every one, in order that men might devote their leisure to and expend their
                  energies on honourable pursuits, and might become inclined to do good to, and to
                  share their good things with others; appointed a simple and independent mode of
                  life to every one; considering that those desires and pleasures which had
                  reference to eating and drinking were those of the greater power, and of the
                  highest estimation, and moreover innate in all men; and that those men who
                  continued orderly and temperate in respect of them, would also be temperate and
                  well regulated in other matters. Accordingly, he laid down a simple mode of life
                  for every one, and enjoined the same system indifferently to kings and private
                  individuals, and young men and old, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Viands of simple kinds allure the taste,</l>

                  his heroes anything except such dishes as these, either at a sacred festival, or
                  at a marriage feast, or at any other sort of convivial meeting. And this, too,
                  though he often represents Agamemnon as feasting the chiefs. And Menelaus makes a
                  feast on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter Hermione; and again on the
                  occasion of the marriage of his son; and also when Telemachus comes to him— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     </l>
                  </quote> For Homer never puts rissoles, or forcemeat, or cheeseakes, or omelettes
                  before his princes, but meat such as was calculated to make them vigorous in body
                  and mind. And so too Agamemnon feasted Ajax after his single combat with Hector,
                  on a rumpsteak; and in the same way he gives Nestor, who was now of advanced age,
                  and Phœnix too, a roast sirloin of <pb n="v.1.p.14"/> beef. And Homer describes
                  Alcinous, who was a man of a very luxurious way of life, as having the same
                  dinner; wishing by these descriptions to turn us away from intemperate indulgence
                  of our appetites. And when Nestor, who was also a king and had many subjects,
                  sacrificed to Neptune on the sea-shore, on behalf of his own dearest and most
                  valued friends, it was beef that he offered him. For that is the holiest and most
                  acceptable sacrifice to the gods, which is offered to them by religious and
                  well-disposed men. And Alcinous, when feasting the luxurious Phæacians, and when
                  entertaining Ulysses, and displaying to him all the arrangements of his house and
                  garden, and showing him the general tenor of his life, gives him just the same
                  dinner. And in the same way the poet represents the suitors, though the most
                  insolent of men and wholly devoted to luxury, neither eating fish, nor game, nor
                  cheesecakes; but embracing as far as he could all culinary artifices, and all the
                  most stimulating food, as Menander calls it, and especially such as are called
                  amatory dishes, (as Chrysippus says in his Treatise on Honour and Pleasure,) the
                  preparation of which is something laborious.</p>

                  any one tasting lamb which had not been shorn, on an occasion when the breed of
                  sheep appeared to be failing. And Homer, though he speaks of the Hellespont as
                  abounding in fish, and though he represents the Phæacians as especially addicted
                  to navigation, and though he knew of many harbours in Ithaca, and many islands
                  close to it, in which there were large flocks of fishes and of wild birds; and
                  though he enumerates among the riches of the deep the fact of its producing fish,
                  still never once represents either fish or game as being put on the table to eat.
                  And in the same way he never represents fruit as set before any one, although
                  there was abundance of it; and although he is fond of speaking of it, and although
                  he speaks of it as being supplied without end. For he says, <quote>Pears upon
                     pears,</quote> and so on. Moreover, he does not represent his heroes as
                  crowned, or anointed, or using <pb n="v.1.p.15"/> perfumes; but he portrays even
                  his kings as scorning all such things, and devoting themselves to the maintenance
                  of freedom and independence.</p>
               <p>In the same way he allots to the gods a very simple way of life, and plain food,
                  namely, nectar and ambrsia; and he represents men as paying them honour with the
                  materials of their feasts; making no mention of frankincens, or myrrh, or
                  garlands, or luxury of this sort. And he does not describe them as indulging in
                  even this plain food to an immoderate extent; but like the most skilful physicians
                  he abhors satiety. <quote rend="blockquote">

                  good, has represented Nestor, the wisest of the Greeks, as bringing wine to

                  encouraging him to abandon himself to pleasure. But he, as he is going out to
                  action, puts off the drinking. And she indeed, praises wine without ceasing; but
                  he, when he comes in out <pb n="v.1.p.16"/> of breath, will not have any. And she
                  urges him to pour a libation and then to drink, but he, as he is all covered with
                  blood, thinks it impiety.</p>
               <p>Homer knew also the use and advantages of wine, when he said that if a man drank
                  it in too large draughts it did harm. And he was acquainted, too, with many
                  different ways of mixing it. For else Achilles would not have bade his attendants
                  to mix it for him with more wine than usual, if there had not been some settled
                  proportion in which it was usually mixed. But perhaps he was not aware that wine
                  was very digestible without any admixture of solid food, which is a thing known to
                  the physicians by their art; and, therefore, in the case of people with heartburn
                  they mix something to eat with the wine, in order to retain its power. But Homer
                  gives Machaon meal and cheese with his wine; and represents Ulysses as connecting
                  the advantages to be derived from food and wine with one another when he says—

               <p>Homer, too, represents the virgins and women washing the strangers, knowing that
                  men who have been brought up in right principles will not give way to undue warmth
                  or violence; and accordingly the women are treated with proper respect. And this
                  was a custom of the ancients; and so too the daughters of Cocalus wash Minos on
                  his arrival in Sicily, as if it was a usual thing to do. On the other hand, the
                  poet, wishing to disparage drunkenness, represents the Cyclops, great as he was,
                  destroyed through inebriety by a man of small stature, and also Eurytian the
                  Centaur. And he relates how the men at Circe's court were transformed into lions
                  and wolves, from a too eager pursuit of pleasure. But Ulysses was saved from

                  the Greeks also as drinking hard when sailing away from Troy, and on that account
                  quarrelling with one another, and in consequence perishing. And he relates that
                  Aeneas, the most eminent of the Trojans for wisdom , was led away by the manner in
                  which he had talked, and bragged, and made promises to the Trojans, while engaged
                  in drinking, so as to encounter the mighty Achilles, and was nearly killed. And
                  Agamemnon says somewhere about drunkennes— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>In Homer they eat sitting down; but some think that a separate table was set
                  before each of the feasters. At all events, they say a polished table was set
                  before Mentes when he came to Telemachus, arriving after tables were already laid
                  for the feast. However, this is not very clearly proved, for Minerva may have
                  taken her food at Telemachus's table. But all along the banqueting-room full
                  tables were laid out, as is even now the custom among many nations of the
                  barbarians, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Laden with all dainty dishes,</l>
                  </quote> as Anacreon says. And then when the guests have departed, the

               <pb n="v.1.p.19"/>
               <p>The feast which he mentions as taking place in the palace of Menelaus is of a
                  peculiar character; for there he represents the guests as conversing during the
                  banquet and then they wash their hands and return to the board, ad proceed to
                  supper after having indulged their grief. But the line in the last book of the
                  Iliad, which is usually read, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He eat and drank, while still the table stood,</l>
                  </quote> should be read, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He eat and drank still, while the table stood,</l>
                  </quote> or else there would be blame implied for what Achilles was doing at the
                  moment; for how could it be decent that a table should be laid before Achilles, as
                  before a party of revellers, down the whole length of a banqueting-room? Bread,
                  then, was placed on the table in baskets, and the rest of the meal consisted
                  wholly of roast meat. But Homer never speaks of broth, Antiphanes says, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He never boil'd the legs or haunches,</l>
                     <l>But roasted brains and roasted paunches,</l>

                  </quote> From these passages Zenodotus got the idea that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαῖτα</foreign>
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐΐσην</foreign> meant a good feast; for as food is a
                  necessary good to men, he says that he, by extension of the meaning of the word,
                  called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐΐσην.</foreign> But men in the early times, as
                  they had not food in sufficient abundance, the moment any appeared, rushed on it
                  all at once, and tore it to pieces with violence, and even took it away from
                  others who had it; and this disorderly behaviour gave rise to bloodshed. A d it is
                  from this that very probably the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτασθαλία</foreign>
                  originated, because it was in <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλιαι,</foreign> another name
                  for banquets, tat men first offended against one another. But when, by the bounty
                     <pb n="v.1.p.20"/> of Ceres, food became abundant, then they distributed an
                  equal portion to each individual, and so banquets became orderly entertainments.
                  Then came the invention of wine and of sweetmeats, which were also distributed
                  equally: and cups, too, were given to men to drink out of, and these cups all held
                  the same quantity. And as food was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαὶς,</foreign>
                  from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίεσθαι,</foreign> that is, from being divided, so he
                  who roasted the meat was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαιτρὸς,</foreign> because
                  it was he who gave each guest an equal portion. We must remark that the poet uses
                  the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαὶς</foreign> only of what is eaten by men, and
                  never applies it to beasts; so that it was out of ignorance of the force of this
                  word that Zenodotus, in his edition writes:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  fragments, but when they were satisfied they left them with the givers of the

                  again, the poet compares the companions of Ulysses, who were seized by Sylla, to
                  fish caught with a long rod and thrown out of doors; and he speaks more accurately

                  the subject. I refer to Cæcilius of Argos, and Numenius of Heraclea, and Pancrates
                  the Arcadian, and Posidonius the Corinthian, and Oppianus the Cilician, who lived
                  a short time ago; for we <pb n="v.1.p.21"/> know of all those men as writers of
                  heroic poems about fishing. And of prose essayists on the subject we have Seleucus
                  of Tarsus, and Leonidas of Byzantium, and Agathocles of Atracia. But he never
                  expressly mentions such food at his banquets, just as he also forbears to speak f
                  the meat of young animals, as such food was hardly considered suitable to the
                  dignity of heroes of reputation. However, they did eat not only fish, but oysters;
                  though this sort of food is neither very wholesome nor very nice, but the oysters
                  lie at the bottom of the sea, and one cannot get at them by any other means,
                  except by diving to the bottom. <quote rend="blockquote">

                  cultivating a disposition like that of philosophers. And accordingly Agamemnon
                  leaves his bard as a guardian and counsellor to Clytæmnestra: who, first of all,
                  going through all the virtues of women, endeavoured to inspire her with an
                  ambition of excelling in virtuous and ladylike habits; and, after that, by
                  supplying her with agreeable occupation, sought to prevent her inclinations from
                  going astray after evil thoughts: so that Aegisthus could not seduce the woman
                  till he had murdered the bard on a desert island. And the same is the character of
                  that bard who sings under compulsion before the suitors; who bitterly reproached
                  them for laying plots against Penelope. We find too that using one general <pb n="v.1.p.23"/> term, Homer calls all bards objects of veneration among men.

               <p>The dances spoken of in Homer are partly those of tumblers and partly those of
                  ball-players; the invention of which last kind Agallis, the Corcyrean authoress,
                  who wrote on grammar, attributes to Nausicaa, paying a compliment to her own
                  countrywoman; but Dicæarchus attributes it to the Sicyonians. But Hippasus gives
                  the credit of both this and gymnastic exercises to the Lacedæmonians. However,
                  Nausicaa is the only one of his heroines whom Homer introduces playing at ball.
                  Demoteles, the brother of Theognis the Chiansophist, was eminent for his skill in
                  this game; and a man of the name of Chærephanes, who once kept following a
                  debauched young man, and did not speak to him, but prevented him from misbehaving.
                  And when he said, <quote>Chærephanes, you may make your own terms with me, if you
                     will only desist from following me;</quote>

               </p>
               <p>The thing called <foreign xml:lang="grc">φούλλικλον,</foreign>, which appears to
                  have been a kind of small ball, was invented by Atticus the Neapolitan, the tutor
                  in gymnastics of the great Pompey. And n the <pb n="v.1.p.24"/> game of ball the
                  variation called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁρπαστὸν</foreign> used to be called
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαινίνδα,</foreign> and I think that the best of all the

            <div type="chapter" n="26">
               <p>There is a great deal of exertion and labour in a game of ball, and it causes
                  great straining of the neck and shoulders. Antiphanes says, <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> and again Antiphanes describes the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαινίνδα</foreign> thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>To make good strokes and quick returns.</l>
                  </quote> And it was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαινίνδα</foreign> from the rapid
                  motion of those who played, or else because its inventor, as Juba the Mauritanian
                  says, was Phænestius, a master of gymnastics. And Antiphanes, <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And those who played paid great attention to elegance of motion and
                  attitude; and accordingly Demoxenus says:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                        Apollo, near akin to the Pæan. It was of a very lively character,
                        accompanied with dancing (whence the name) and pantomimic action; and is
                        compared by Athenæus to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόρδαξ</foreign> (630 E).

                  of dance is an imitation of actions which are explained by words, and is what the
                  elegant Xenophon represents as having taken place, in his Anabasis, at the banquet
                  given by Seuthes the Thracian. He says:</p>
               <p>"After libations were made, and the guests had sung a pæan, there rose up first
                  the Thracians, and danced in arms to the music of a flute, and jumped up very
                  high, with light jumps, and used their swords. And at last one of them strikes
                  another, so that it seemed to every one that the man was wounded. And he fell down
                  in a very clever manner, and all the bystanders raised an outcry. And he who
                  struck him having stripped him of his arms, went out singing Sitalces. And others
                  of the Thracians carried out his antagonist as if he were dead; but in reality, he
                  was not hurt. After this some Aenianians and Magnesians rose up, who danced the
                  dance called Carpæa, they too being in armour. And the fashion of that dance was
                  like this: One man, having laid aside his arms, is sowing, and driving a yoke of
                  oxen, constantly looking round as if he were afraid. Then three comes up a robber;
                  but the sower, as soon as he sees him snatches up his arms and fights in defence
                  of his team in regular time to the music of the flute. And at last the robber,
                  having <pb n="v.1.p.26"/> bound the man, carries off the team; but sometimes the
                  sower conquers the robber, and then binding him alongside his oxen, he ties his
                  hands behind him, and drives him forward. And one man," says he, <quote>danced the
                     Persian dance, and rattling one shield against another, fell down, and rose up
                     again: and he did all this in time to the music of a flute. And the Arcadians
                     rising up, all moved in time, being clothed in armour, the flute-players
                     playing the tune suited to an armed march; and they sung the pæan, and
                     danced.</quote>

                  they made libations, when they got up from the feast, making them to Mercury, and
                  not, as they did afterwards, to Jupiter the Finisher. For Mercury appears to be
                  the patron of sleep: they drop libations to him also on their tongues when they
                  depart from a banquet, and the tongues are especially allotted to him, as being
                  the instruments of eloquence.</p>
               <p>Homer was acquainted also with a variety of meats. At all events he uses the
                  expression <quote>various meats,</quote> and <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Meats such as godlike kings rejoice to taste.</l>
                  </quote> He was acquainted, too, with everything that is thought luxurious even in
                  our age. And accordingly the palace of Menelaus is the most splendid of houses.
                  And Polybius describes the palace of one of the Spanish kings as being something
                  similar in its appointments and splendour, saying that he was ambitious of
                  imitating the luxury of the Phæacians, except as far as there stood in the middle
                  of the palace huge silver and golden goblets full of wine made of barley. But
                  Homer, when describing the situation and condition of Calypso's house, represents
                  Mercury as astonished; and in his descriptions the life of the Phæacians is wholly
                  devoted to pleasure: <quote rend="blockquote">

                  not allowed to exhibit itself; for it would be impossible for the Phæacians to be

                  says.</p>

               <p>In Homer, too, the suitors amused themselves in front of the doors of the palace
                  with dice; not having learnt how to play at dice from Diodorus of Megalopolis, or
                  from Theodorus, or from Leon of Mitylene, who was descended from Athenian
                  ancestors: and was absolutely invincible at dice, as Phanias says. But Apion of
                  Alexandria says that he had heard from Cteson of Ithaca what sort of game the game
                  of dice, as played by the suitors, was. For the suitors being a hundred and eight
                  in number, arranged their pieces opposite to one another in equal numbers, they
                  themselves also being divided into two equal parties, so that there were on each
                  side fifty-four; and between the men there was a small space left empty. And in
                  this middle space they placed one man, which they called Penelope. And they made
                  this the mark, to see if any one of them could hit it with his man; and then, when
                  they had cast lots, he who drew the lot aimed at it. Then if any one hit it and
                  drove Penelope forward out of her place, then he put down his own man in the place
                  of that which had been hit and moved from its place. After which, standing up
                  again, he shot his other man at Penelope in the place in which she was the second
                  time. And if he hit her again without touching any one of the other men, he won
                  the game, and had great hopes that he should be the man to marry her. He says too
                  that Eurymachus gained the greatest number of victories in this game, and was very
                  sanguine about his marriage. And in consequence of their luxury the suitors had
                  such tender hands that they were not able to bend the bow; and even their servants
                  were a very luxurious set.</p>

                  her handmaids to prepare for Ulysses. And Nestor makes it a boast to Telemachus

               <p>But in Homer the chiefs banquet in Agamemnon's tent in a very orderly manner; and
                  if in the Odyssey Achilles and Ulysses dispute and Agamemnon exults, still their
                  rivalry with one another is advantageous, since what they are discussing is
                  whether Troy is to be taken by stratagem, or by open-hand fighting. And he does
                  not represent even the <pb n="v.1.p.29"/> suitors as drunk, nor has he ever made
                  his heroes guilty of such disorderly conduct as Aeschylus and Sophocles have,
                  though he does speak of the foot of an ox being thrown at Ulysses.</p>

               <p>And his heroes sit at their banquets, and do not lie down. And this was sometimes
                  the case at the feasts of Alexander the king, as Dures says. For he once, when
                  giving a feast to his captains to the number of six thousand, made them sit upon
                  silver chairs and couches, having covered them with purple covers. And Hegesander
                  says that it was not the custom in Macedonia for any one to lie down at a banquet,
                  unless he had slain a boar which had escaped beyond the line of nets; but with
                  that exception, every one sat at supper. And so Cassander, when he was thirty-five
                  years of age, supped with his father in a sitting posture, not being able to
                  perform the above-mentioned exploit, though he was of man's estate, and a gallant
                  hunter.</p>
               <p>But Homer, who has always an eye to propriety, has not introduced his heroes
                  feasting on anything except meat, and that too they dressed for themselves. For it
                  caused neither ridicule nor shame to see them preparing and cooking their own
                  food: for they studied to be able to wait upon themselves; and they prided
                  themselves, says Chrysippus, on their dexterity in such matters. And accordingly
                  Ulysses boasts of being a better hand than any one else at making a fire and
                  cutting up meat. And in the book of the Iliad called The Prayers,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Ninth Book.</note> Patroclus acts as
                  cupbearer, and Achilles prepares the supper. And when Menelaus celebrates a
                  marriage feast, Megapenthes the bridegroom acts as cupbearer. But now we have come
                  to such a pitch of effeminacy as to lie down while at our meals.</p>

                  that Alexis says that even if a man could bathe in a bath of perfume he would not
                  be content. And all the manufactories of sweetmeats are in great vigour, and such
                  plans are devised for intercourse between people, that some have proposed even to
                  stuff the sofas and chairs with sponge, as on the idea that that will make the
                  occupiers more amorous. And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of
                  wondrous efficacy in such matters; and Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to
                  some of the presents which Sandrocottus, the king of the Indians, sent to
                  Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of
                  affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love. Music, too, has been
                  cultivated now, in a way which is a great perversion of its legitimate use: and
                  extravagance has descended even to our clothes and shoes.</p>

                  </quote> We must remark, too, that in the Odyssey he represents his characters as

                  trace of such a custom. For the life described in the Odyssey is that of men
                  living easily and luxuriously owing to the peace; on which account the men <pb n="v.1.p.31"/> of that time indulged their bodies with baths and washings. And
                  that is the reason why in that state of things they play at dice, and dance, and
                  play ball. But Herodotus is mistaken when he says that those sports were invented
                  in he time of Atys to amuse the people during the famine. For the heroic times are
                  older than Atys. And the men living in the time of the Iliad are almost constantly
                  crying out— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Now to go back to what we were saying before. The Athenians made Aristonicus the
                  Carystian, who used to play at ball with Alexander the king, a freeman of their
                  city on account of his skill, and they erected a statue to him. And even in later
                  times the Greeks considered all handicraft trades of much less importance than
                  inventions which had any reference to amusement. And the people of Histiæa, and of
                  Oreum, erected in their theatre a brazen statue holding a die in its hand to
                  Theodorus the juggler. And on the same principle the Milesians erected one to
                  Archelaus the harp- player. But at Thebes there is no statue to Pindar, though
                  there is one to Cleon the singer, on which there is the inscription— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Stranger, thou seest Pytheas' tuneful son,</l>

                     <l>E'en the high heavens with his name resound.</l>
                  </quote> Polemo relates that when Alexander razed Thebes to the ground, one man
                  who escaped hid some gold in the garments of this statue, as they were hollow; and
                  then when the city was restored he returned and recovered his money after a lapse
                  of thirty years. But Herodotus, the logomime as he was called, and Archelaus the
                  dancer, according! to Hegesander, were more honoured by Antiochus the king than
                  any others of his friends. And Antiochus his father made the sons of Sostratus the
                  flute-player his body guards.</p>

                  dramas. And they also erected a statue of Euripides in the theatre next to the
                  statue of Aeschylus. Xenophon the conjuror, too, was very popular among them, who
                  left behind him a pupil of the name of Cratisthenes, a citizen of Phlias; a man
                  who used to make fire spout up of its own accord, and who contrived many other
                  extraordinary sights, so as almost to make men discredit the evidence of their own
                  senses. And Nymphodorus the conjuror was another such; a man who having quarrelled
                  with the people of Rhegium, as Duris relates, was the first man who turned them
                  into ridicule as cowards. And Eudicus the buffoon gained great credit by imitating
                  wrestlers and boxers, as Aristoxenus relates. Straton of Tarentum, also, had many
                  admirers; he was a mimic of the dithyrambic poets; and so had Aenonas the Italian,
                  who mimicked the harp-players; and who gave representations of the Cyclops trying
                  to sing, and of Ulysses when shipwrecked, speaking in a clownish fashion. And
                  Diopeithes the Locrian, according to the account of Phanodemus, when he came to
                  Thebes, fastened round his waist bladders full of wine and milk, and then,
                  squeezing them, pretended that he was drawing up those liquids out of his mouth.
                  And Noëmon gained a great reputation for the same sort of tricks.</p>
               <p>There were also in Alexander's court the following jugglers, who had all a great
                  name. Scymnus of Tarentum, and Philistides of Syracuse, and Heraclitus of
                  Mitylene. And there were too some strolling players of high repute, such as
                  Cephisodorus and Pantaleon. And Xenophon makes mention also of Philip the
                  buffoon.</p>

                  And all these nations, being so to say the entire population of the world, called
                  the dancer who was so famous in our time Memphis, comparing him, on account of the

               <p>Now of tragic dancing, as it was called, such as it existed in his time, Bathyllus
                  of Alexandria was the first introducer; whom Seleucus describes as having been a
                  legitimate dancer. This Bathyllus, according to the account of Aristonicus, and
                  Pylades too, who has written a treatise on dancing, composed the Italian dance
                  from the comic one which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόρδαξ,</foreign> and
                  from the tragic dance which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμμέλεια,</foreign>
                  and from the Satyric dance which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίκιννις,</foreign> (from which also the Satyrs were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σικιννισταί,</foreign>) the inventor of which was a barbarian
                  named Sicinnus, though some say that Sicinnus was a Cretan. Now, the dance
                  invented by Pylades was stately, pathetic, and laborious; but that of Bathyllus
                  was in a merrier style; for he added to his a kind of ode to Apollo. But
                  Sophocles, in addition to being eminent for personal beauty, was very accomplished
                  in music and dancing, having been instructed in those arts while a boy by Lamprus,
                  and after the naval victory of Salamis, he having no clothes on, but only being
                  anointed with oil, danced round the trophy erected on that occasion to the music
                  of the lyre, but some say that he had his tunic on; and when he exhibited his
                  Thamyris he himself played the harp; and he also played at <pb n="v.1.p.34"/>
                  ball with great skill when he exhibited his Nausicaa. And Socrates the Wise was
                  very fond of the dance Memphis; and as he was often caught dancing, as Xenophon
                  relates, he said to his friends that dancing was a gymnastic exercise for every
                  limb; for the ancients used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχέομαι</foreign> for
                  every sort of motion and agitation. Anacreon says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But Aeschylus was not only the inventor of becoming and dignified dress, which the
                  hierophants and torch-bearers of the sacred festivals imitated; but he also
                  invented many figures in dancing, and taught them to the dancers of the chorus.
                  And Chamæleon states that he first arranged the choruses; not using the ordinary
                  dancing-masters, but himself arranging the figures of the dancers for the chorus;
                  and altogether that he took the whole arrangement of his tragedies on himself. And
                  he himself acted in his own plays very fairly. And accord- ingly, Aristophanes
                  (and we may well trust the comic writers in what they say of the tragedians)
                  represents Aeschylus himself as saying— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I myself taught those dances to the chorus,</l>
                     <l>Which pleased so much when erst they danced before us.</l>

                     when the men came on who were uniting with Priam in his petition for the ransom

                  Telesis, or Telestes, (whichever was his right name,) the dancing-master, invented
                  many figures, and taught men to use the action of their hands, so as to give
                  expression to what they said. Phillis the Delian, a musician, says, that the
                  ancient harp-players moved their countenances but little, but their feet very
                  much, imitating the march of troops or the dancing of a chorus. Accordingly
                  Aristotle says, that Telestes the director of Aeschylus's choruses was so great a
                  master of his art, that in managing the choruses of the Seven Generals against
                  Thebes, he made all the transactions plain by dancing. They say, too, that the old
                  poets, Thespis, Pratinas, Carcinus, and Phrynichus, were called dancing poets,
                  because they not only made their dramas depend upon the dancing of the chorus, but
                  because, besides directing the exhibition of their own plays, they also taught
                  dancing to all who wished to learn. But Aeschylus was often drunk when he wrote
                  his tragedies, if we may trust Chamæleon: and accordingly Sophocles reproached
                  him, saying, that even when he did what was right he did not know that he was ding
                  so.</p>

                  as the best of all, on account of its movement of the hands. And dancing was

                  called Sicelizing. And that he was followed by Cleophantus of Thebes. Among the

                  </quote> Nor did those heroes allow the birds the free enjoyment of the air;
                  setting traps and nets for thrushes and doves. And they practised the art of
                  taking birds, and, suspending a dove by a small string to the mast of a ship, then
                  shot arrows at it from a distance, as is shown in the book describing the funeral
                  games. But Homer passed over the use of vegetables, and fish, and birds, lest to
                  mention them should seem like praising gluttony, thinking besides there would be a
                  want of decorum in dwelling on the preparation of such things, which he considered
                  beneath the dignity of gods and heroes. But that they did in reality eat their

                     <l>On the full board, with every kind of meat;</l>

                  may see here the origin of the Sicilian and Sybaritic and Italian ways of giving
                  feasts, and the Chian fashion also. For the Chians are reported not to have been
                  less studious than the other nations just mentioned in the art of dressing their
                  meat. Timocles says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  and Nestor, sleep with the women; and Menelaus is the only man who has no woman

                  Though in reality old wine is not only more pleasant, but also better for health;
                  for it aids digestion more; and being thinner it is itself more digestible; it
                  also invigorates the body; and makes the blood red and fluid, and produces
                  untroubled sleep. But Homer praises that wine most which will admit of a copious
                  admixture of water; as the Maronean. And old wine will allow of more water being
                  added to it, because its very age has added heat to it. And some men say, that the
                  flight of Bacchus to the sea is emblematic of the making of wine, as it was
                  practised long ago; because wine is very <pb n="v.1.p.43"/> sweet when sea-water
                  is poured into it. And Homer praising dark-coloured wine, often calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴθοψ.</foreign> For the dark-coloured wine is the strongest, and
                  it remains in the system of the drinkers of it longer than any other. But
                  Theopompus says, that black wine was first made among the Chians; and, that the
                  Chians were the first people who imparted the knowledge of planting and tending
                  vines to the rest of mankind, having learnt it from Œnopion the son of Bacchus,
                  who was the original colonizer of their island. But white wine is weak and thin;
                  but yellow wine is very digestible, being of a more drying nature.</p>

               <p>Respecting the Italian wines, Galen is represented by this sophist as saying, that
                  the Falernian wine is fit to drink from the time that it is ten or fifteen years
                  old, till it is twenty; but after that time it falls off, and is apt to give
                  headaches, and affects the nervous system. There are two kinds of Falernian wine,
                  the dry and the sweet. The sweet wine is made when the south wind blows through
                  the vineyard; which also makes it darker in colour. But that which is not made at
                  this time is dry and yellow. Of the Alban wine there are also two kinds, one sweet
                  and one sour; and both are in their prime after they are fifteen years old. The
                  wine of Surrentum begins to be drinkable when five-and-twenty years old; for as it
                  has no oil of any sort in it, and is very thin, it is a long time ripening: and
                  when it is old it is nearly the only wine that is wholesome to be drunk for a
                  continuance. But the Rhegian wine, being richer than the Surrentine, may be used
                  as soon as it is fifteen years old. The wine of Privernum too is very good, being
                  thinner than the Rhegian wine, and one which does not take much effect on the
                  head. And the Formian wine is like it; and is a wine which soon comes to its
                  prime; it is, however, a richer wine than the other, But the Trifoline wine is
                  slower ripening, and has a more earthy taste than the Surrentine. The Setine is a
                  wine of the first class, like the Falernian wine, but lighter, and not so apt to
                  make "a man drunk. The wine of Tibur is thin, and evaporates easily, being at its
                  best as soon as it is ten years old. Still it is better as it gets older. The
                  Labican wine is sweet and oily to the taste, being something between the Falerrian
                  and the Alban: and you may drink that when it is ten years old. There is the
                  Gauran wine too, a scarce and very fine wine, and <pb n="v.1.p.44"/> likewise
                  very powerful and oily; more so indeed than the wine of Præneste or of Tibur. The
                  Marsic is a very dry wine; and very good for the stomach. Around Cumæ in Campania
                  there is a wine made which is called Ulban, a light wine, fit to be drunk when
                  five years old. The wine of Ancona is a fine wine, and rather oily. The Buxentine
                  is like the Alban, as far as being rather sour; but it is a strong wine, and good
                  for the stomach. The Veliternian wine is very sweet to drink and good for the
                  stomach; but it has this peculiarity, that it does not taste like a pure wine, but
                  always has an appearance as if some other was mixed with it. The Calenian wine is
                  light, and better for the stomach than the Falernian. The Cæcuban is a noble wine,
                  full of strength and easily affecting the head; but it does not come to its prime
                  till after many years. The Fundan wine is strong, and nutritious, and affects the
                  head and stomach, on which account it is not much used at banquets. But the Sabine
                  wine is lighter than any of these, and is fit to be drunk from the time that it is
                  seven years old till it is fifteen; and the Signine wine is available at six years
                  old, but as it gets older it is far more valuable. The wine of Nomentum gets in
                  season very early, and can be drunk as soon as it is five years old; it is not
                  very sweet, and not very thin; but that of Spoletum is very sweet to the taste,
                  and has a golden colour. The wine of Capua is in many respects like the Surrentine
                  wine. The Barbine is very dry and continually improving. The Caucine too is a
                  noble wine, and resembles the Falernian. The wine of Venafrum is good for the
                  stomach, and light. The Trebellian wine, which is made round Naples, is of
                  moderate strength, good for the stomach, and pleasant to the taste. The Erbulian
                  wine is at first dark coloured, but in a few years it becomes white; and it is a
                  very light and delicate wine. That of Marseilles is a fine wine, but it is scarce,
                  and thick, with a good deal of body. The Tarentine, and all the other wines of
                  that district, are delicate wines, without very much strength or body, sweet, and
                  good for the stomach. The Mamertine is a foreign wine, made out of Italy. There is
                  also another wine made in Sicily, and called Iotaline; it is a sweet wine and
                  light, but there is some strength in it.</p>

                  But he, being made insolent and having his head turned by this liberality,
                  attempted to make himself tyrant of his country, and collected an army for that

                  mountain, from which the Pramnian wine has its name, and some call it a medicinal
                  wine. Now Icarus used formerly to be called the Fishy Icarus, from the number of
                  fish around it; just as the Echinades had their name from the sea-urchins, and the

                  another from Œnus, and another from Onogle and Stathmi. And these places are all
                  near Pitane. Accordingly, he says, <quote>And wine from Œnus, or from Denthis, or

               <p>Now of wines some are white, some yellow, and some red. The white is the thinnest
                  in its nature, diuretic, and warm; and being a promoter of digestion it causes a
                  heat in the head; for it is a wine which has a tendency to move upwards. But of
                  red wine that which is not sweet is very nutritious, and is astringent; but that
                  which is sweet (as is the case with even white and yellow wine also) is the most
                  nutrition of all: for it softens all the ducts and passages, and thickens the

                  wine, and that of Halicarnassus. And so Menippus the Cynic calls Myndus
                     <quote>brine-drinking.</quote> The Coan wine too has a good deal of sea-water
                  in it. The Rhodian has not so much sea-water; but a great deal of that wine is
                  good for nothing. Wine made in the islands is very good to drink, and not at all
                  ill-calculated for daily use. But Cnidian wine makes blood, is nutritious, and
                  keeps the bowels in a healthy state; though if it is drunk in great quantities it
                  relaxes the stomach. The Lesbian wine is less astringent, and more diuretic. But
                  the Chian is a nicer wine; and of all the Chian wine, that called the Aryusian is
                  the best. And of this there are three varieties: for there is a dry kind, and a
                  sweet kind; and that the flavour of which is between the two is called <hi rend="italics">autocratic,</hi> that is, self-mixed. Now the dry kind is
                  pleasant to the taste, nutritious, and more diuretic than the others; but the
                  sweet kind is nutritious, filling, and apt to soften the bowels. The autocratic
                  wine in its effects also is something between the two. But, generally speaking,
                  the Chian wine is digestible, nutritious, a producer of good blood, mild, and
                  filling, inasmuch as it has a great deal of body. But the nicest of all wines are
                  the Alban and Falernian wines of Italy; but these, if they have been kept a length
                  of time and are old, acquire a medicinal effect, and rapidly produce a sensation
                  of heaviness. But the wine called Adrian relieves any oppression of the breath, is
                  very digestible, and wholly free from all unpleasant consequences; but these wines
                  require to be made with rapidity, and then to be set in an open place, so as to
                  allow the thicker portions of their body to evaporate. But the best wine to keep a
                  length of time is the Corcyrean. The Zacynthian and Leucadian wines also are apt
                  to be bad for the head, because they contain chalk. There is a wine from Cilicia,
                  called Abates, which has no effect except that of relaxing the bowels. But hard
                  water, such as that from springs, or from rain if it is filtered, and has stood
                  some time, agrees very well with Coan and Myndian and Halicarnassian wine, <pb n="v.1.p.55"/> and indeed with every wine which has plenty of salt-water in
                  it. And accordingly these wines are of the greatest use at Athens and Sicyon,
                  because the waters in these cities are harsh. But for those wines which have no
                  sea-water, and which are of a more astringent nature, especially for the Chian and
                  Lesbian wine, the purest water is the most suitable. <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>The Mareotic wine, which comes from Alexandria, had its name from a fountain in
                  the district of Alexandria called Marea; and from a town of the same name which
                  was close to it; which was formerly a place of great importance, but is now
                  reduced to a petty village. And the fountain and town derived their name from
                  Maro, who was one of the companions of Bacchus in his expedition. And there are
                  many vines in that country, which produce grapes very good to eat when raw, and
                  the wine which is made from them is excellent. For it is white, and sweet, and
                  good for the breath, and digestible, and then, it never produces any ill effect on
                  the head, and is diuretic. And still better than this is the wine called Tæniqtic.
                  The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταινία</foreign> means a riband; and there is in
                  that district a long narrow riband of land, the wines produced from which are of a
                  slightly green colour, with something oily in them, which is quickly dissolved
                  when it is mixed with water; just as the Attic honey is dissolved by the same
                  process. This Tæniotic wine, in addition to being sweet, has something aromatic in
                  it, of a slightly astringent character. But there are vines near the Nile in great
                  quantities as far as the river extends; and there are many peculiarities in those
                  vines, both a to their colour and as to their use. However, the best of all the
                  wines made in that district is that made near the city of Antylla (which is not
                  far from Alexandria), the revenues fro which the kings of those ages, both the
                  Egyptian and Persian kings, used to give to their wives for pin-money. But the
                  wine which is made in the Thebais, especially that near the city Coptos, is light,
                  and easy of digestion, and also so great an assistant in <pb n="v.1.p.56"/> the
                  digestion of the rest of one's food, that it is given to people in fevers without
                  injury. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <div type="chapter" n="61">
               <p>Theopompus the Chian says, that the vine is found at Olympia, near the Alpheus;
                  and that there is a place about eight furlongs from Elis where the natives at the
                  time of the Dionysian games close up three empty brazen vessels, and seal them in
                  the presence of all the people round about; and at a subsequent time they open
                  them and find them full of wine. But Hellanicus says, that the vine was first
                  discovered in Plinthina, a city of Egypt; on which account Dion, the academic
                  philosopher, calls the Egyptians fond of wine and fond of drinking: and also, that
                  as subsidiary to wine, in the case of those who, on account of their poverty,
                  could not get wine, there was introduced a custom of drinking beer made of barley;
                  and moreover, that those who drank this beer were so pleased with it that they
                  sung and danced, and did everything like men drunk with wine. Now Aristotle says,
                  that men who are drunk with wine show it in their faces; but that those who have
                  drunk too much beer fall back and go to sleep; for wine is stimulating, but beer
                  has a tendency to stupefy.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="62">
               <p>Now that the Egyptians really are fond of wine this is a proof, that they are the
                  only people among whom it is a custom at their feasts to eat boiled cabbages
                  before all the rest of their food; and even to this very time they do so. And many
                  people add cabbage seed to potions which they prepare as preventives against
                  drunkenness. And wherever a vineyard has cabbages growing in it, there the wine is
                  weaker. On which account the citizens of Sybaris also, as Timmeus says, used to
                  eat cabbages before drinking. And so Alexis says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Last evening you were drinking deep,</l>

                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.1.p.57"/> For the ancients used to call cabbage <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάφανος.</foreign> And so Apollodorus of Carystus expressly says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>We call it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάφανος,</foreign> and strangers <foreign xml:lang="grc">κράμβη</foreign>;</l>
                     <l>But sure to women they must both the same be.</l>
                  </quote> And Anaxandrides says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And clouds which hover round your forehead.</l>

                     <l>Which equally rid you of all your sorrow.</l>
                  </quote> And Amphis tells us— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>When one's been drunk, the best relief I know</l>

                  </quote> And Theophrastus also speaks of the effect which the cabbage produces,
                  saying that the vine as long as it lives always turns away from the smell of

                     obtain the kingdom; and while he was there, a bitch which he had brought forth
                     a stalk: and he ordered it to be buried in the ground, and from it <pb n="v.1.p.58"/> there sprang up a vine loaded with grapes. On which account
                     he called his son Phytius. And he had a son named Œneus, who was so called from
                     the vines: for the ancient Greeks,</quote> says he, <quote>called vines

               <p>Timæus of Tauromenium relates that there was a certain house at Agrigentum called
                  the Trireme, on this account:— Some young men got drunk in it, and got so mad when
                  excited by the wine, as to think that they were sailing in a trireme, and that
                  they were being tossed about on the sea m a violent storm; and so completely did
                  they lose their senses, that they threw all the furniture, and all the sofas and
                  chairs and beds, out of window, as if they were throwing them into the sea,
                  fancying that the captain had ordered them to lighten the ship because of the
                  storm. And though a crowd collected round the house and began to plunder what was
                  thrown out, even that did not cure the young men of their frenzy. And the next
                  day, when the prætors came to the house, there were the young men still lying,
                  sea-sick as they said; and, when the magistrates questioned them, they replied
                  that they had been in great danger from a storm, and had consequently been
                  compelled to lighten the ship by throwing all their superfluous cargo into the
                  sea. Arid while the magistrates marvelled at the bewilderment of the men, one of
                  them, who seemed to be older than the rest, said, <quote>I, O Tritons, was so
                     frightened that I threw myself down under the benches, and lay there as low
                     down and as much out of sight as I could.</quote> And the magistrates forgave
                  their folly, and dismissed them with a reproof, and a warning not to indulge in
                  too much wine in future. And they, professing to be much obliged to them, said,
                     <quote>If we arrive in port after having escaped this terrible storm, we will
                     erect in our own country statues of you as our saviours in a conspicuous place,

                     that which they now call a bowl. And of these bowls some were never put on the

               <p>And Philochorus relates that Amphictyon, the king of the Athenians, having learnt
                  of Bacchus the art of mixing wine, <pb n="v.1.p.63"/> was the first man who ever
                  did mix it: and that it is owing to him that men who have been drinking on his
                  system can walk straight afterwards, when before they used to blunder about after
                  drinking sheer wine: and on this account he erected an altar to the Straight
                  Bacchus in the temple of the Seasons; for they are the Nymphs who cherish the
                  fruit or the vine. And near it he built also an altar to the Nymphs, as a memorial
                  to all who use mixed drink; for the Nymphs are said to have been the nurses of
                  Bacchus. And he made a law to bring an unmixed wine after meals only just enough
                  to taste, as a token of the power of the Good Deity. But the rest of the wined was
                  put on the table ready mixed, in whatever quantity any one chose. And then he
                  enjoined the guests to invoke in addition the name of Jupiter the Saviour, for the
                  sake of instructing and reminding the drinkers that by drinking in that fashion
                  they would be preserved from injury. But Plato, in his second book of the Laws,
                  says that the use of wine is to be encouraged for the sake of health. But on
                  account of the look which habitual drunkards get, they liken Bacchus to a bull;
                  and to a leopard, because he excites drunkards to acts of violence. And Alcæus
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Wine sometimes than honey sweeter,</l>
                     <l>Sometimes more than nettles bitter.</l>
                  </quote> Some men, too, are apt to get in a rage when drunk; and they are like a
                  bull. Euripides says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Fierce bulls, their passion with their horns displaying.</l>
                  </quote> And some men, from their quarrelsome disposition when drunk, are like

                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατὺς,</foreign> he uses the word in the sense of broad.
                  But with respect to sweet water, he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  object was to stop the hemorrhage, cold water would have been useful, since that
                  contracts and closes up wounds; but with the view of relieving the pain, he bathes
                  these with warm water, which has a soothing effect. And in Homer the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λιαρὸς</foreign> is used for what we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">θερμὸς,</foreign>
                  <hi rend="italics">warm.</hi> And he shows that plainly enough in what he says

                  </quote> (Tilphossa is a fountain in Bœotia;) and Aristophanes says that Tiresias
                  died from drinking of it, as at his advanced age he was unable to bear its extreme
                  cold. And Theophrastus, in his book on Waters, says that the water of the Nile is
                  the most productive and the sweetest of all waters, and that it is also very
                  relaxing to the bowels of those who drink it, as it has in it a mixture of nitre.
                  And again, in his book on Plants, he says that there is in some places water which
                  has a procreative tendency; as for instance at Thespiæ: and at Pyrrha there is a
                  water which causes barrenness. But it happened once when there was a drought in
                  the district around the Nile, that the water of that river became unwholesome, and
                  many of the Egyptians died. Theophrastus states, moreover, that not only do bitter
                  waters sometimes change their nature, but that salt water does so too, and
                  sometimes whole rivers do so; as in the case of the fountain in Cithæron, near
                  which there is a temple of Jupiter; and of that in Cairo, near which there is a
                  temple of Neptune: and the reason is, that many thunderbolts fall in those
                  countries.</p>

               <p>But there are some waters which have a good deal of body in them, and are of
                  considerable weight; as that in Trœzen,—for that gives the mouths of those who
                  taste it a feeling of fulness. And the waters near the mines in Pangæum, in
                  winter, weigh ninety-six drachms to half a pint, but in summer they only weigh
                  forty-six. For the cold contracts and condenses it; on which account that which is
                  used in hour- <pb n="v.1.p.69"/> glasses does not make the hours in winter the
                  same as those in summer, but longer; for the flow is slower on account of the
                  increased density of the water. And he sys that the same is the case in Egypt,
                  though the air there is softer. Brackish water is more earthy, and requires more
                  working; as also does sea-water, the nature of which is warmer, and which is not
                  exposed to the same changes as river-water And there is one salt spring which is
                  of invincible hardness,—I mean that of Arethusa. But as a general rule heavy
                  waters are worse, and so are hard and cold waters, for the same reason; for they
                  are not so easily prepared for use, some because they are very earthy, and some
                  from the excess of cold. But those waters which are quickly warmed are light and
                  wholesome. And in Crannon there is a spring of a gentle warmth, which keeps wine
                  which is mixed with it of the same temperature for two or three days. But flowing
                  waters, and waters from aqueducts, are, as a general rule, better than stagnant
                  ones, being softer because of the collisions to which they are subjected; and on
                  this account water derived from snow appears to be good, because its more
                  drinkable qualities are brought to the surface, and are exposed to the influence
                  of the air; and for the same reason they think it better than rain-water: and on
                  the same ground, too, they prefer water from ice, because it is lighter; and the
                  proof is, that ice is itself lighter than the rest of the water. But very cold
                  water is hard, as being earthy; but that with much body in it, when it is warmed,
                  is susceptible of greater heat, and when it is cold, descends to a more intense
                  cold. And for the same reason water on the mountains is better to drink than water
                  in the plains; for there is in such less admixture of earthy matter. And it is
                  from the earthy particles present that waters vary in colour: at all events, the
                  water of the lake at Babylon is red for some days after it is drawn; and that of
                  the Borysthenes is for some time of a violet or dark colour, although it is
                  unusually thin in quality; and a proof of this is, that at the point where it
                  meets the Hypanis its waters flow above those of the latter while the north winds
                  prevail.</p>

               <p>And in many places there are fountains, some of which are good for drinking, and
                  have a vinous flavour; as for instance, one in Paphlagonia, which they say the
                  natives come to for the express purpose of drinking. Some, again, are salt, with
                     <pb n="v.1.p.70"/> a rather bitter flavour; as some among the Sicani in
                  Sicily. And in the Carthaginian dominions there is a fountain on which there is
                  something which floats resembling oil, but darker in colour, which they skim off
                  and make into balls, and use for their sheep and cattle; and in other districts,
                  too, there are fountains of a greasy nature,—like the one in Asia concerning which
                  Alexander wrote a letter, saying that he had found a fountain of oil. And of
                  waters which are warm by nature some are sweet, as that at Aegee in Cilicia, and
                  that at Pagasæ, and that at Larissa in the Troas, and that near Magnesia, and that
                  in Melos, and that in Lipara, and that in Prusa,—the Prusa, I mean, near Mount
                  Olympus in Mysia,—which is called the Royal fountain. But that in Asia near
                  Tralles, and those near the river Characometes, and near the city of Mysia, are so
                  oily that those who bathe in them have no need of oil. And there is a similar
                  fountain in the village of Dascylum. There is also one at Carura of an exceeding
                  dryness and heat: and there is another near Menoscome, which is a village in
                  Phrygia, of a rougher and a more nitrous quality; as there is too in a village in
                  Phrygia, called The Lion's Village. And there is a spring near Dorylæum, which is
                  very delicious to drink; but those which are at Baiæ or Baium, a harbour in Italy,
                  are utterly undrinkable.</p>

                  distance of five days' journey from its head, is thin and sweet to the taste; but
                  that four days' journey further on it becomes bitter, because some bitter spring
                  falls into it. And Theopompus says that near the river Erigone all the water is

                  Achillean, the stream of which is very sweet, while the sediment is brackish: this
                  is the water in which the Milesians say that their hero bathed when he had slain
                  Trambelus the king of the Leleges. And they say, too, that the water in Cappadocia
                  never becomes putrid, but there is a great deal in that district, of an admirable
                  quality, though it has no outlet unless it flows underground. And Ptolemy the
                  king, in the Seventh Book of his Commentaries, says that as you go to Corinth
                  through the district called Contoporia, when you have got to the top of the
                  mountain there is a fountain whose waters are colder than snow, so that many
                  people are afraid to drink of it lest they should be frozen; but he says that he
                  drank of it himself. And Phylarchus states that at Cleitor there is a spring which
                  gives those who drink of it a distaste for the smell of wine. And Clearchus tells
                  us that water is called white, like milk; and that wine is called red, like
                  nectar; and that honey and oil are called yellow, and that the juice which is
                  extracted from the myrtle-berry is black. Eubulus says that "water makes those who

                  greatest abundance of gold and silver in their country. And he says, too, that
                  they eat only once a day, out of stinginess, though they wear most expensive
                  clothes. And Aristotle or Theophrastus speaks of a man named Philinus as never
                  having taken any drink or solid food whatever, except milk alone, during the whole

                  Anchimolus and Moschus, sophists who lived in Elis, were water-drinkers all their
                  lives; and that they ate nothing but figs, and for all that, were quite as healthy
                  and vigorous as any one else; but that their perspiration had such an offensive

                  laden with silver vessels containing this water, which was boiled to make it keep.

                  how it was put into the vessels and bought to the king, saying that it was the
                  lightest and sweetest of all waters. And the second king of Egypt, he who was

                  him. And that fountain is, as Bion relates, between the Mædi and the Pæonians, and
                  is called Inna. But Staphylus says, that Melampus was the first who invented the

                  often turns sour on the stomach. So that a man who has a regard for his health,
                  ought to take regular exercise, for the sake of promoting frequent perspiration;
                  and he ought also to use the bath regularly for the sake of moistening and
                  relaxing his body. And besides this, and before he bathes, he should drink water,
                  as being an excellent thing,—drinking warm water usually in winter and spring, and
                  cold water in summer, in order not to weaken the stomach. But he should only drink
                  in moderation before the bath or the gymnasium, for the sake of diffusing what he
                  drinks throughout his system beforehand, and in order to prevent the unmixed
                  strength of wine from having too much effect on his extremities. And if any one
                  thinks it too much trouble to live on this system, let him take sweet wine, either

                  roses, and if they cannot get that, with that distilled from apples, in order to
                  ward off the effects of the drink, and in order also to avoid being injured by the
                  evaporation of the wine; ad if they cannot get ointment of apples, they then use
                  that extracted from the iris or from spikenard, so that Alexis very neatly

                  sediment. Hippocrates says, <quote>Water which is easily warmed or easily chilled
                     is always lighter.</quote> But that water is bad which takes a long time to
                  boil vegetables; and so too is water full of nitre, or brackish. And in his book
                  upon Waters, Hippocrates calls good water drinkable; but stagnant water he calls
                  bad, such as that from ponds or marshes. And most spring-water is rather hard. But
                  Erasistratus says that some people test water by weight, and that is a most stupid
                  proceeding. <quote>For just look,</quote> says he, <quote>if men compare the water
                     from the fountain Amphiaraus with that from the Eretrian spring, though one of
                     them is good and the other bad, there is absolutely no difference in their
                     respective weights.</quote> And Hippocrates, in his book on Places, says that
                  those waters are the best which flow from high ground, and from dry hills,
                     <quote>for they are white, and sweet, and are able to bear very little wine,
                     and are warm in winter and cold in summer.</quote> And he praises those most,
                  the springs of which break towards the east, and especially towards the
                  north-east, for they must inevitably be clear, and fragrant, and light. Diodes
                  says that water is good for the digestion, and not apt to cause flatulency, that
                  it is moderately cooling, and good for the eyes, and that it has no tendency to
                  make the head feel heavy, and that it adds vigour to the mind and body. And
                  Praxagoras <pb n="v.1.p.76"/> says the same; and he also praises rain-water. But
                  Euenor praises water from cisterns, and says that the best is that from the
                  cistern of Amphiaraus, when compared with that from the fountain in Eretria.</p>

               <p>But that water is undeniably nutritious is plain from the fact that some animals
                  are nourished by it alone, as for instance, grasshoppers. And there are many other
                  liquids which are nutritious, such as milk, barley-water, and wine. At all events,
                  animals at the breast are nourished by milk; and there are many nations who drink
                  nothing but milk. And it is said that Democritus, the philosopher of Abdera, after
                  he had determined to rid himself of life on account of his extreme old age, and
                  when he had begun to diminish his food day by day, when the day of the
                  Thesmophorian festival came round, and the women of his household besought him not
                  to die during the festival, in order that they might not be debarred from their
                  share in the festivities, was persuaded, and ordered a vessel full of honey to be
                  set near him: and in this way he lived many days with no other support than honey;
                  and then some days after, when the honey had been taken away, he died. But
                  Democritus had always been fond of honey; and he once answered a man, who asked
                  him how he could live in the enjoyment of the best health, that he might do so if
                  he constantly moistened his inward parts with honey, and his outward man with oil.
                  And bread and honey was the chief food of the Pythagoreans, according to the
                  statement of Aristoxenus, who says that those who eat this for breakfast were free
                  from disease all their lives. And Lycus says that the Cyrneans (and they are a
                  people who live near Sardinia) are very long-lived, because they are continually
                  eating honey; and it is produced in great quantities among them.</p>

               <p>The Persians, according to the account of Heraclides, are the people who first
                  introduced the system of having particular servants to prepare the couches, in
                  order that they might always be elegantly arranged and well made. And on this
                  account Artaxerxes, having a high esteem for Timagoras the Cretan, or, as Phanias
                  the Peripatetic says, for Entimus the Gortinian, who went up to the king in
                  rivalry of Themistocles, gave him a tent of extraordinary size and beauty, and a
                  couch with silver feet; and he sent him also expensive coverlets, and a man to
                  arrange them, saying that the Greeks did not know how to arrange a couch. And so
                  completely had this Cretan gained the favour of the king, that he was invited to a
                  banquet of the royal family, an honour which had never been paid to any Greek
                  before, and never has been since; for it was reserved as an especial compliment
                  for the king's relations. Nor was this compliment paid to Timagoras the Athenian,
                  who submitted to offer adoration t the king, and who was held in the highest
                  honour by him, though some of the things which were set before the kin were sent
                  to him from the royal table. The king of Persi, too, once took achaplet from off
                  his head and dipped it in perfume, and sent it to Antalcidas the Lacedæmonian. But
                  he did this too, and many similar things, to Entimus; also, and in addition to
                  everything else, he invited him to a banquet of the royal family. And the Persians
                  were very indignant this, <pb n="v.1.p.80"/> thinking that it was making such an
                  honour too common, and also because they thought they were on the eve of another
                  expedition against Greece. He sent him also a couch with silver feet, and cushions
                  for it, and a flowered tent surmounted with a canopy, and a silver chair, and a
                  gilt parasol, and some golden vessels inlaid with precious stones, and a hundred

               <p>We find a fruit called Damascenes. Now many of the ancient writers mention

                  cultivated there with exceeding care, the tree itself has got to be called a
                  Damascene, as being a kind of plum different from what is found in other
                  countries. The fruit is more like prunes. And many writers speak of them, and

               <p>There is another fruit, called Cherries.—Theophrastus says, in his book on Plants,
                  that the Cherry-tree is a tree of a peculiar character, and of large size, for it
                  grows to a height of four-and-twenty cubits,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A cubit was about 18 1/4 .inches.</note> and its leaf is like
                  that of the medlar, but somewhat harder and thicker, and its bark like the linden;
                  its flower is white, like that of the pear or the medlar, consisting of a number
                  of small petals of a waxy nature; its fruit is red, like that of the lotus in
                  appearance, and of the size of a bean; but the kernel of the lotus is hard, while
                  that of the cherry is soft. And again he says, <quote>The <foreign xml:lang="grc">κράταιγος,</foreign> which some call <foreign xml:lang="grc">κραταίγων,</foreign> has a spreading leaf like a medlar, only that is
                     larger, and wider, and longer; and it has no deep grain in it as the medlar
                     has. The tree is neither very tall nor very large; the wood is variegated,
                     yellow, and strong: it has a smooth bark, like that of the medlar; and a single
                     root, which goes down very deep into the earth; the fruit is round, of the size
                     of an olive; when fully ripe it is of a yellow colour, becoming gradually
                     darker; and from its flavour and juice it might almost be taken for a wild
                     medlar.</quote> By which description of the cratægus it appears to me that he
                  means the tree which is now called the cherry.</p>

                     Mithridates and Tigranes, was the first man who Introduced this plant into
                     Italy from Cerasus, a city of Pontus; and he it was who gave the fruit the

               <p>With respect to Almonds.—The Naxian almonds are mentioned by the ancient writers;
                  and those in the island of Naxos are superior to all others, as I am well
                  persuaded. Phrynichus says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He knock'd out all my grinders, so that now</l>
                     <l>A Naxian almond I can hardly crack.</l>
                  </quote> The almonds in the island of Cyprus also are very excellent, and in
                  comparison of those which come from other quarters, they are very long, and
                  slightly bent at the end. And Seleucus in his Dictionary says, that the
                  Lacedæmonians call soft nuts <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύκηροι.</foreign> And the
                  Servians give that name to sweet nuts. But Arnexias says that it is the almond
                  which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύκηρος.</foreign> We may add, there is
                  nothing which is a greater provocative of drinking than almonds when eaten before
                  meals. Eupolis says in his Taxiarchs— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Give me some Naxian almonds to regale me,</l>
                     <l>And from the Naxian vines some wine to drink.</l>
                  </quote> For there was a vine called the Naxian vine.</p>
               <pb n="v.1.p.86"/>
               <p>And Plutarch of Chæronea says, that there was in the retinue of Drusus the son of
                  Tiberius Cæsar, a certain physician who surpassed all men in drinking, and who was
                  detected in always eating five or six bitter almonds before he drank. But when he
                  was prevented from eating them he was not able to stand even a very limited
                  quantity of wine; and the cause of this was the great power of the bitterness of
                  the almond, which is of a very drying nature, and which has the quality of
                  expelling moisture.</p>
               <p>Herodian of Alexandria says, that almonds derive the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμύγδαλαι,</foreign> because beneath their green bark they have many <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμυχαὶ,</foreign> or lacerations.</p>
               <p>Philemon says somewhere or other— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You, like an ass, come to the husks of the dessert;</l>

               <p>We also find the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμύγδαλον</foreign> in the neuter
                  gender. Diphilus says— <quote rend="blockquote">

            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="40">
               <p>Now with respect to the pronunciation and accent of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμυγδάλη</foreign>, Pamphilus thinks that there ought to be a grave accent
                  when it means the fruit, as it is in the case of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμύγδαλον.</foreign> But he wants to circumflex the word when it means the
                  tree, thus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμυγδαλῆ</foreign> like <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥοδῆ.</foreign> And Archilochus says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The lovely flower of the rose-tree (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥοδῆς</foreign>).</l>
                  </quote> But Aristarchus marks the word, whether it means the fruit or the tree,
                  with an acute accent indifferently; while Philoxenus would circumflex the word in
                  either sense. Eupolis says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You'll ruin me, I swear it by the almond.</l>
                  </quote> Aristophanes says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And Phrynichus says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The almond is a good cure for a cough.</l>
                  </quote> And others speak of almonds as beautiful. But Tryphon in his book on
                  Attic Prosody accents <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμυγδάλη,</foreign> when meaning <pb n="v.1.p.87"/> the fruit, with a grave accent, which we use in the neuter as
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμύγδαλον.</foreign> But he writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμυγδαλῆ,</foreign> with a circumflex for the tree; it being as it were a
                  possessive form derived from the fruit, and as such contracted and
                  circumflexed.</p>
               <p>Pamphilus in his Dictionary says that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυκηρόβατον</foreign> is called the nut-cracker by the Lacedæmonians, when
                  they mean the almond-cracker; for the Lacedæmonians call almonds <foreign xml:lang="grc">μούκηροι.</foreign>

               <p>Nicander mentions also nuts of Pontus, which some writers call <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόπιμα</foreign>; while Hermonax and Timachidas, in the
                  Dictionary, say that the acorn of Jupiter, or walnut, is what is called the nut of
                  Pontus.</p>
               <p>But Heraclides of Tarentum asks, <quote>Whether sweetmeats ought to be put on the
                     table before supper, as is done in some parts of Asia and Greece; or whether
                     they ought to be brought on after supper is over.</quote> If it is decided that
                  they are to be brought on at the end of supper, then it follows, that when a great
                  deal of food has already been put into the stomach and bowels, the nuts which are
                  eaten afterwards as provocatives of drinking, get entangled with the rest of the
                  food, and produce flatulence, and also cause what has been eaten to turn on the
                  stomach, because it is followed by what is by nature unmanageable and
                  indigestible; and it is from such food that indigestions and attacks of diarrhœa
                  arise.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="42">
               <p>Diodes asserts that almonds are nutritious and good for the stomach, and that they
                  have a heating effect because they contain something like millet; but green
                  almonds are less likely to have an injurious effect than dry ones; and almonds
                  soaked in water have such an effect less than those which are not soaked; and when
                  toasted less than when raw. But walnuts, which are also called nuts of Heraclea,
                  and acorns of Jupiter, are not indeed so nutritious as almonds, but still they
                  have something like millet in them, and something apt to rise to the surface; so,
                  if they are eaten in ay quantity they make the head feel heavy; they, however, are
                  less likely to produce injurious effects when green than when dry.</p>
               <p>Persian nuts too are as apt to produce headches as the acorns of Jupiter; but they
                  are more nutritious, though they make the throat and mouth feel rough; but when
                  they are roasted they are less injurious, and when eaten with honey, they are the
                  most digestible of all nuts The broad Persian nuts <pb n="v.1.p.88"/> have the
                  greatest tendency to produce flatulence; but when boiled they are less injurious
                  than when raw, or even when roasted. But Philotimus in his treatises on
                  Nourishment says, <quote>The broad nut, and that which is called the Sardinian
                     nut, are both exceedingly indigestible when raw, and are very slow in
                     dissolving in the stomach, as they are kept down by the phlegm in the stomach,
                     and as they themselves are of an astringent nature. The Pontic nut too is oily
                     and indigestible; but the almond is not so indigestible as that, and
                     accordingly if we eat a number of them we do not feel any inconvenience; and
                     they appear more oily, and give out a sweet and oily juice.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>Diphilus of Siphnos says—<quote>There is a nut called the Royal nut, which causes
                     severe headaches, and keeps rising in the stomach; and there are two sorts of
                     them, one of which, that which is tender and white, is the more juicy and the
                     better; but that which is roasted in ovens is not nutritious. Almonds have a
                     tendency to make people thin, and are diuretic and cathartic, and far from
                     nutritious; and the dry ones are far more apt to produce flatulence and are far
                     more indigestible than the green ones, which do not give much juice, and which
                     are not very nutritious; but those which are tender, and full, and white, being
                     like milk, are more full of wholesome juice. And the Thasian and Cyprian nuts,
                     being tender, are far more easily digested than dry ones. The nuts of Pontus
                     are apt to produce headaches, but still they are not so indigestible as the
                     Royal nuts.</quote>

               <p>Moreover, Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his book on Comestibles, says, <quote>The
                     digestion of Eubœan nuts or chestnuts (for they are called by both names) is
                     very difficult for the stomach, and is attended with a great deal of
                     flatulence. And they are apt to thicken the juice, and to make people fat,
                     unless their constitution is strong enough to neutralise them. But almonds, and
                     likewise the nuts of Heraclea, and the Persian nuts, and all others of the same
                     sort, are still worse than these: and it is desirable to touch absolutely none
                     whatever of these things unless they are first cooked by fire; with the
                     exception of, perhaps, the green almonds. But one should boil some of them, and
                     roast others; for some of them are of an oily nature, as the dry almonds and
                     the acorns of Jupiter; but some are hard and harsh, as the nuts of the <pb n="v.1.p.89"/> beech and all that kind. And from the oily sorts the action
                     of the fire extracts the oil, which is the worst part of them: but those which
                     are hard and harsh are softened, and, so to say, ripened, if any one cooks them
                     over a small and gentle fire.</quote>

               <p>But Diphilus calls chestnuts also Sardinian acorn, saying that they are very
                  nutritious, and full of excellent juice; but not very easy of digestion, because
                  they remain a long time in the stomach; that, however, when they are roasted they
                  are less nutritious, but more digestible; and that when boiled they are less apt
                  to produce flatulence than the others, and more nutritious. <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Polemo says, that the Lacedæmonians call lupins <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυσιλαΐδες.</foreign> And Theophrastus, in his book about The Causes of
                  Plants, tells us that the lupin, and the bitter vetch, and the common vetch, are
                  the only kinds of green vegetable which do not produce animal life, because of
                  their harshness and bitterness. But the vetch, says he, turns black as it decays.
                  He says, also, that caterpillars come in vetches, and it is in the fourth book of
                  the same treatise that he states this. Diphilus the Siphnian writer says that
                  lupins are very apt to create moisture, and are very nutritious, especially those
                  kinds Which are rendered sweet by being soaked. On which account Zeno the Citiæan,
                  a man of harsh disposition and very apt to get in a passion with his friends, when
                  he had taken a good deal of wine, became sweet-tempered and gentle; and when
                  people asked him what produced this difference in his disposition, he said, that
                  he was subject to the same influences as lupins: for that they before they were
                  cooked were very bitter; but that when they had been steeped in liquor they were
                  sweet and wholesome.</p>

                  that olives contain very little nourishment, and are apt to give headaches; and
                  that the black ones are still worse for the stomach, and make the head feel heavy;

                  clearly refer to the radishes, and not to the cuttle-fish; as is shown by

                  </quote> So that radishes appear to have been particularly called un- washed
                  radishes; being probably the same as those called Thasian. Pherecrates says—

                  which is of a round form, is the sweetest. And he says that, as a general rule,
                  those the leaves of which are smooth, are the sweetest. But Callias used the form
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάφανος</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάφανις</foreign>; at all events, when discussing the antiquity of comedy, he

                  is plainly sown by Aristophanes, who in the Danaïdes alludes to such old forms,

                     the cultivated mallow are called 'the cheese-cake,' as being like a
                     cheese-cake. For those pistils which are like the teeth of a comb have some
                     resemblance to the edge of a cheese-cake; and there is a boss like centre, like
                     that in the middle of a cheese-cake. And the whole circumference of the rim is
                     like the sea-fish denominated the sea-urchin.</quote> But Diphilus the Siphnian
                  makes a statement, that the mallow is full of pleasant and wholesome juice; having
                  a tendency to smooth the arteries, separating from them the harshnesses of the
                  blood by bringing them to the surface. And he adds that the mallow is of great
                  service in irritations of the kidneys and the bladder, and that it is very
                  tolerably digestible and nutritious. And moreover, that the wild mallow is
                  superior to that which grows in a garden. But Hermippus, the follower of
                  Callimachus, in his treatise on the Seven Wise Men, says that mallows are put in
                  what he calls the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλιμον,</foreign> that is to say, the
                  preventive against hunger, and into the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδιψον,</foreign>

               <p>The next thing to be mentioned are Gourds.—Euthy- <pb n="v.1.p.97"/> demus, the
                  Athenian, in his book on Vegetables, calls the long gourd, known as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολοκύντη,</foreign> the Indian gourd; and it is called Indian
                  because the seed was originally introduced from India. But the people of
                  Megalopolis call the same the Sicyonian gourd. Theophrastus however says, that of
                  the kind called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολοκύντη,</foreign> there is not one
                  species or genus only, but several, some better, some worse. While Meodorus, the
                  follower of Erasistratus, the friend of Icesius, says, <quote>Of the long gourds
                     there is the Indian, which is the same which we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">σικύα,</foreign> and which is vulgarly called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολοκύντη.</foreign> Now the Indian gourd is usually boiled, but that
                     called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολοκύντη</foreign> is usually roasted.</quote>
                  And even to the present day the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολόκυνται</foreign> are
                  called by the Cnidians Indian gourds; while the people of the Hellespont call the
                  long gourds <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίκυαι,</foreign> and the round gourds <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολόκυνται.</foreign> But Diocles states that the best round
                  gourds are those grown near Magnesia; and, moreover, that the rape grown in that
                  district runs to an exceedingly large size, and is sweet, and good for the
                  stomach. He says, at the same time, that the best cucumbers are grown at Antioch,
                  the best lettuce at Smyrna and Galatea, and the best rue at Myra. Diphilus says,
                  "The gourd is far from nutritious, easily digested, apt to produce moisture in the
                  skin, promotes the secretions of the body, and is full of agreeable and wholesome
                  juice; but it is still more juicy when cooked. Its alterative qualities are
                  increased when it is eaten with mustard, but it is more digestible, and it
                  promotes the secretions more, when boiled.</p>
               <p>Mnesitheus too says, "All the vegetables and fruits which are easily affected by
                  the action of fire, such as the cucumber, and the gourd, and the quince, and the
                  small quince, and everything else of the same sort, when they are eaten after
                  having been roasted, afford nutriment to the body, in no great quantity indeed,
                  but still such as is pleasant and promotes moisture. However all these vegetables
                  and fruits have a tendency to produce constipation, and they ought to be eaten
                  boiled rather than raw. But the Attic writers call the gourd by no other name but
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολοκύντη.</foreign> Hermippus says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Diphilus says that mushrooms are good for the stomach, and pass easily through the
                  bowels, and are very nutritious, but still that they are not very digestible, and
                  that they are apt to produce flatulence. And that especially those from the island
                  of Ceos have this character. "Many are even poisonous to a fatal degree. But those
                  which seem to be wholesome are those with the smoothest rinds, which are tender
                  and easily crushed: such as grow close to elms and pine-trees. But those which are
                  unwholesome are of a dark colour, or livid, or covered with hard coats; and those
                  too which get hard after being boiled and placed on the table; for such are deadly
                  to eat. But the best remedy for them when eaten unawares is drinking honey-water,
                  and fresh mead, and vinegar. And after such a drink the patient should vomit. On
                  which account, too, it is especially desirable to dress mushrooms with vinegar, or
                  honey and vinegar, or honey, or salt: for by these means their choking properties
                  are taken away. But Theophrastus, in his treatise about Plants, writes thus—
                     <quote>But plants of this kind grow both under the ground and on the ground,
                     like those things which some people call fungi, which grow in company with
                     mushrooms; for they too grow without having any roots; but the real mushrooms
                     have, as the beginning by which they adhere to the ground, a stalk of some
                     length, and they put forth fibres from that stalk.</quote> He <pb n="v.1.p.102"/> says also that in the sea which is around the Pillars of Her-
                  cules, when there is a high tide, mushrooms grow on the shore close to high-water
                  mark, which they say are left there by the sun. And Phænias says, in his first
                  book about Plants —<quote>But these things neither put forth any bloom, nor any
                     trace of seminal germination; as, for instance, the mushroom, the truffle,
                     groundivy, and fern.</quote> And in another place he says,<quote>

               <p>Now with respect to Truffles.—They too spring of their own accord out of the
                  ground; especially in sandy places. And Theophrastus says of them—<quote>The
                     truffle, which some people call the geranium, and all other such plants which
                     grow beneath the earth.</quote> And in another place he says- "The generation
                  and production of these things which seed beneath the earth; as, for instance, of
                  the truffle, and of a plant which grows around Cyrene, which they call <hi rend="italics">misy.</hi> And it appears to be exceedingly sweet, and to have a
                  smell like that of meat; and so, too, has a plant called <hi rend="italics">itum,</hi> which grows in Thrace. And a peculiarity is mentioned as incidental
                  to these things; for men say that they appear when there is heavy rain in autumn
                  and violent thunder; especially when there is thunder, as that is a more
                  stimulating cause of them: however, they do not last more than a year, as they are
                  only annuals; they are in the greatest perfection in the spring, when they are
                  most plentiful. Not but what there are people who believe that they are or can be
                  raised from seed. At all events, they say that they never appeared on the shore of
                  the Mitylenæans, until after a heavy shower some seed was brought from Tiaræ; and
                  that is the place where they are in the greatest numbers. But they are principally
                  found on the sea-shore, and wherever the ground is sandy; and that is the
                  character of the place called Tiaræ. They are also found near Lampsacus, and also
                  in Acarnania, and Alopeconnesus, and in the district of the Eleans. Lynceus the
                  Samian says—<quote>The sea produces nettles, and the land produces
                     truffles;</quote> and Matron, the man who wrote parodies, says in his

                  <pb n="v.1.p.103"/> Diphilus says that truffles are by nature indigestible, but
                  that they are full of wholesome juice, and have lenitive qualities, and are very
                  easily evacuated; though, like mushrooms, some of them are apt to produce
                  suffocation. And Hegesander the Delphian says that no truffles are found in the
                  Hellespont, and no fish of the kind called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλαυκίσκος,</foreign> and no thyme. On which account Nausiclides said of the

                  asparagus and marsh asparagus; the best kinds of which are not raised from seed;
                  but they are remedies for every kind of internal disorder. But those which are
                  raised from seed grow to an immense size. And they say that in Libya, among the
                  Gætuli, they grow of the thickness of a Cyprian reed, and twelve feet long; but
                  that on the mountain land and on land near the sea they grow to the thickness of
                  large canes, and twenty cubits long. But Cratinus writes the word, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπάραγος,</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσφάραγος,</foreign> with a <foreign xml:lang="grc">φ</foreign>. And Theopompus

                  called the bursting asparagus, is better for the stomach, and is more easily
                  digested; but that it is not very good for the eyes: and it is harsh-flavoured and
                  diuretic, and injurious to the kidneys and bladder. But it is the Athenians who
                  give it the name of bursting; and they also give the flowering cabbage, or
                  cauliflower, the same name. Sophocles says, in The Huntsmen— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  says moreover that the artichoke grows near the river Indus. And Scylax, or
                  Polemo, writes, <quote>that that land is well watered with fountains and with
                     canals, and on the mountains there grow artichokes and many other
                     plants.</quote> And immediately afterwards he adds, <quote>From that point a
                     mountain stretches on both sides of the river Indus, very lofty, and very
                     thickly overgrown with wild wood and the prickly artichoke.</quote>

               <p>But Didymus the grammarian, explaining what is meant by Sophocles when he speaks
                  of the prickly artichoke (which he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύναρος</foreign>),
                  says, "Perhaps he means the dog-brier, because that plant is prickly and rough;
                  for the Pythian priestess did call that plant a wooden bitch. And the Locrian,
                  after he had been ordered by an oracle to build a city in that place in which he
                  was bitten by a wooden bitch, having had his leg scratched by a dog-brier, built
                  the city in the place <pb n="v.1.p.117"/> where the brier had stood. And there is
                  a plant called the dog-brier, something between a brier and a tree, according to
                  the statement of Theophrastus, and it has a red fruit, like a pomegranate, and it
                  has a leaf like that of the willow.</p>

               <p>Phænias, in the fifth book of his treatise on Plants, speaks of one which he calls
                  the Sicilian cactus a very prickly plant. As also does Theophrastus, in his sixth
                  book about Plants, who says, <quote>But the plant which is called the cactus
                     exists only in Sicily, and is not found in Greece: and it sends forth stalks
                     close to the ground, just above the root. And the stalks are the things which
                     are called cacti: and they are eatable as soon as they are peeled, and rather
                     bitter; and they preserve them in brine. But there is a second kind, which
                     sends up a straight stalk, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτέρνιξ</foreign>; and that also is eatable. The shell of the fruit, as
                     soon as the outer soft parts have been taken away, is like the inside of a
                     date: that also is eatable; and the name of that is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσκάληρον.</foreign>
                  </quote> But who is there who would not place such belief in these assertions as
                  to say confidently that this cactus is the same as that plant which is called by
                  the Romans <hi rend="italics">carduus,</hi> or thistle; as the Romans are at no
                  great distance from Sicily, and as it is evidently the same plant which the Greeks
                  call <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινάρα,</foreign> or the artichoke? For if you merely

               <p>And Epicharmus also shows us plainly this, when he puts down the cactus in his
                  catalogue of eatable vegetables; in this way—<quote>The poppy, fennel, and the
                     rough cactus; now one can eat of the other vegetables when dressed with milk,
                     if he bruises them and serves them up with rich sauce, but by themselves they

               </head>
               <p>Thales the Milesian, one of the seven wise that the overflowing of the Nile arises
                  from the Etestian for that they blow up the river, and that the mouths of the
                  river lie exactly opposite to the point from which they blow; and accordingly that
                  the wind blowing in the opposite direc- tion hinders the flow of the waters; and
                  the waves of the sea, dashing against the mouth of the river, and coming on with a
                  fair wind in the same direction, beat back the river, and in this manner the Nile
                  becomes full to overflowing. But Anaxagoras the natural philosopher says that the
                  fullness of the Nile arises from the snow melting; and so, too, says <pb n="v.1.p.120"/> Euripides, and some others of the tragic poets. And Anaxagoras
                  says that this is the sole origin of all that fulness; but Euripides goes further,
                  and describes the exact place where this melting of the snow takes place; for in
                  his play called <quote>Archelaus</quote> he speaks thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Danaus, the noble sire of fifty daughters,</l>

                     <l>And o'er the land the Sun his chariot drives.</l>
                  </quote> And in the <quote>Helen</quote> he says something similar:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>These are the beauticous virgin streams of Nile,</l>
                     <l>Which in the place of rain bedew the plain</l>

               <p>And Callisthenes the historian argues against what I quoted just now as stated by
                  Anaxagoras and Euripides: and he, too, declares his own opinion,—that as there is
                  much very heavy and continued rain in Aethiopia about the time of the rising of
                  the Dogstar, and from that period till the rising of Arcturus, and as the Etesian
                  winds blow at about the same time, (for these are the winds which he says have the
                  greatest tendency to bring the clouds over Aethiopia,) when the clouds fall upon
                  the mountains in that region, a vast quantity of water bursts forth, in
                  consequence of which the Nile rises. But Democritus says that about the winter
                  solstice there are heavy falls of snow in the countries around the north; but that
                  when the sun changes its course, at the summer solstice, the snow being melted and
                  evaporated by the warmth, clouds are formed, and then the Etesian gales catch hold
                  of them, and drive them towards the south; and when these clouds are all driven
                  together towards Aethiopia and Libya, a mighty rain ensues, and the water from
                  that flows down the mountains and fills the Nile. This, then, is the cause which
                  Democritus alleges for this fulness of the Nile.</p>

               <p>But Euthymenes the Massiliote says, speaking of his <pb n="v.1.p.121"/> own
                  knowledge, acquired in a voyage which he had made, that the sea outside the
                  Pillars of Hercules flows towards Libya and turns up and proceeds towards the
                  north; and that then, being driven back by the Etesian gales, it is raised to a
                  height by the winds, and flows high at that time; but, when the Etesian gales
                  cease, it recedes. He says moreover, that that sea is sweet to the taste, and that
                  it contains monsters like the crocodiles and the hippopotami in the Nile.</p>
               <p>But Œnopides the Chian says, that in winter the sources of the river are dried up,
                  but in the summer they are thawed and flow; and so that for the sake of filling up
                  the previous dryness, the rains from heaven cooperate with * * * * * * * * And on
                  this account the river is smaller in winter and is full in summer.</p>
               <p>But Herodotus gives an explanation quite contrary to that of the rest of those who
                  have discussed this subject, but agreeing with the explanation of Œnopides; for he
                  says that the stream of the Nile is of such magnitude as always to fill the river;
                  but that the sun, as it makes its journey through Libya in the winter, dries up
                  the river at that time; but that as it has gone off towards the north at the time
                  of the sum- mer solstice, then the river becomes full again, and overflows the
                  plains.</p>
               <p>Now these are the mouths of the Nile:—towards Arabia, the Pelusiac mouth; towards

               <p>Theophrastus, in his book on Plants, writes thus: "The bean in Egypt grows in
                  marshes and swamps; and its stalk is in length, when it is at the largest, about
                  four cubits; but in thickness, it is as thick as one's finger: and it is like a
                  long reed, only without joints. But it has divisions within, running through the
                  whole of it, like honeycombs. And on this stalk is the head and the flower, being
                  about twice the size of a poppy; and its colour is like that of a rose, very full
                  coloured; and it puts forth large leaves. But the root is thicker than the
                  thickest reed, and it has divisions like the stalk. And people eat it boiled, and
                  roasted, and raw. And the men who live near the marshes eat it very much. It
                  grows, too, in Syria and in Cilicia, but those countries do not ripen it
                  thoroughly. It grows, too, around Torone in Chalcidice, in a marsh of moderate
                  size, and that place ripens it, and it brings its fruit to perfection there. But
                  Diphilus the Siphnian says, "The root of the Egyptian bean, which is called
                  colocasium, is very good for the stomach, and very nutritious, but it is not very
                  digestible, being very astringent; and that is the best which is the least woolly.
                  But the beans which are produced by the plant called <hi rend="italics">ciborium,</hi> when they are green are indigestible, not very nutritious,
                  easily pass through one, and are apt to cause flatulence; but when they are dry
                  they are, not so flatulent. And from the genuine ciborium there is a flower which
                  grows which is made into garlands. And the Egyptians call the flower the lotus;
                  but the Naucratitans tell me, says Athenæus, that its name is the melilotus: and
                  it is of that flower that the melilotus garlands are made, which are very
                  fragrant, and which have a cooling effect in the summer season.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="3">
               <p>But Phylarchus says, "that though Egyptian beans had never been sown before in any
                  place, and had never produced <pb n="v.1.p.123"/> fruit if any one had by chance
                  sown a few, except in Egypt, still, in the time of Alexander the king, the son of
                  Pyrrhus, it happened that some sprung up near the river Thyamis in Thesprotia in
                  Epirus, in a certain marsh in that district; and for two years continuously they
                  bore fruit and grew; and that on this Alexander put a guard over them, and not
                  only forbade any one to pick them, but would not allow any one to approach the
                  place: and on this the marsh dried up; and for the future it not only never
                  produced the abovementioned fruit, but it does not appear even to have furnished
                  any water. And something very like this happened at Aedepsus. For at a distance
                  from all other waters there was a spring sending forth cold water at no great
                  distance from the sea; and invalids who drank this water were greatly benefited:
                  on which account many repaired thither from great distances, to avail themselves
                  of the water. Accordingly the generals of king Antigonus, wishing to be economical
                  with respect to it, imposed a tax to be paid by those who drank it: and on this
                  the spring dried up. And in the Troas in former times all who wished it were at
                  liberty to draw water from the Tragasæan lake; but when Lysimachus became ruler
                  there, and put a tax on it, that lake, too, disappeared: and as he marvelled at
                  this, as soon as he remitted the tribute and left the place free, the water came
                  again.</p>

               <p>With respect to Figs.-The fig-tree, says Magnus, (for I will not allow any one to

                  it, for I am most devilishly fond of figs, and I will say what occurs to me;) "the
                  fig-tree, my friends, was the guide to men to lead them to a more civilized life.
                  And this is plain from the fact that the Athenians call the place where it was
                  first discovered The Sacred Fig; and the fruit from it they call <hi rend="italics">hegeteria,</hi> that is to say, <quote>the guide,</quote>
                  because that was the first to be discovered of all the fruits now in cultivation.
                  Now there are many species of figs;—there is the Attic sort, which Antiphanes
                  speaks of in his Synonymes; and when he is praising the land of Attica, he says—

                  export out of Attica the figs which grew in that country, in order that the
                  inhabitants might have the exclusive enjoyment of them. And as many people were
                  detected in sending them away surreptitiously, those who laid informations against
                  them before the judges were then first called sycophants. And Alexis says, in his

                  </quote> And Philomnestus, in his treatise on the Festival of Apollo at Rhodes,
                  which is called the Sminthian festival, says—"Since the sycophant got his name
                  from these circumstance, because <pb n="v.1.p.126"/> at that time there were
                  fines and taxes imposed upon figs and oil and wine, by the produce of which
                  imposts they found money for the public expenses; they called those who exacted
                  these fines and laid these informations sycophants, which was very natural,

                  the Lacedæmonian kinds are desirable, if there is plenty of water.</p>

               <p>Lynceus, too, mentions the fig-trees which grow in Rhodes, in his Epistles;
                  instituting a comparison between the best of the Athenian kinds and the Rhodian
                  species. And he writes in these terms:—<quote>But these fig-trees appear to vie
                     with Lacedæmonian trees of the same kind, as mulberries do with figs; and they
                     are put on the table before supper, not after supper as they are here, when the
                     taste is already vitiated by satiety, but while the appetite is still
                     uninfluenced and unappeased.</quote> And if Lynceus had tasted the figs which

                  I have, he would have been by far more long-sighted than ever his namesake was. So
                  very far superior are those figs to all the other figs in the whole world.</p>
               <p>Other kinds of figs grown near Rome are held in high esteem; and those called the

                  Theophrastus, in his fourth book of his History of Plants, writes as follows:—
                  "The fig called in Crete the Cyprian fig, bears fruit from its stalk, and from its
                  stoutest branches; and it sends forth a small leafless shoot, like a little root,
                  attached to which is the fruit. The trunk is large, and very like that of the
                  white poplar, and its leaf is like that of the elm. And it produces four fruits,
                  according to the number of the shoots which it puts forth. Its sweetness resembles
                  that of the common fig; and within it resembles the wild fig: but in size it is

                  everything which is planted among squills both grows faster and is more sure to be

                     size, bears a very small fruit; and not much of it; as if it had expended all

                     and in Cilicia and Cyprus, which bears green figs; and that tree bears a real
                     fig, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σῦκον,</foreign> in front of the leaf, and a green

                  his mother Earth; and that the earth sent forth that plant as a place of refuge
                  for her son; from whom also the city Sukea in Cilicia has its name. But Pherenicus
                  the epic poet, a Heraclean by birth, says that the fig-tree (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συκῆ</foreign>) is so called from Suke the daughter of Oxylus: for that Oxylus
                  the son of Orius, having intrigued with his sister Hamadryas, had several
                  children, and among them Carya (the nut-tree), Balanus (the acorn-bearing oak),
                  Craneus (the cornel-tree), Orea (the ash), Aegeirus (the poplar), Ptelea (the
                  elm), Am- pelus (the vine), Suke (the fig-tree): and that these daughters were all
                  called the Hamadryad Nymphs; and that from them many of the trees were named. On

                     not whatever they fancy, but what they have, since they have but a rough
                     country; moreover they do not, by Jove, use wine, but they drink water; they

                  are full ripe are quickly dissolved and are digested more easily than any other
                  fruit whatever, nor do they interfere with the digestion of other sorts of food;
                  and they have the ordinary properties of all juicy food, being glutinous and
                  sweet, and slightly nitrous in taste. And they make the evacuations more copious
                  and fluid, and rapid and wholly free from discomfort; and they also diffuse a
                  saltish juice, having a good deal of harshness, when they are combined with
                  anything at all salt. They are very quickly dissolved by the digestion, because,
                  though many heavy things may be taken into the stomach, we still after a short
                  time feel as if we had become excessively empty: but this could not have happened
                  if the figs had remained in the stomach, and were not immediately dissolved. And
                  figs are dissolved more easily than any other <pb n="v.1.p.133"/> fruit; as is
                  proved not only by the fact that though we eat a great many times as great a
                  quantity of figs as of all other fruits put together, we still never feel
                  inconvenienced by them; and even if we eat a quantity of figs before dinner, and
                  then eat as much of other things as if we had never touched them, we still feel no
                  discomfort. It is plain, therefore, that if we can manage both them and the rest
                  of our food, they must be easily digested; and that is why they do not interfere
                  with the digestion of the rest of our food.</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>Figs, then, have the qualities which I have mentioned. That they are
                     glutinous and rather salt is proved by their being sticky and cleansing the
                     hands; and we see ourselves that they are sweet in the mouth. And it certainly
                     needs no arguments to prove that our evacuations after eating them take place
                     without any convulsions or trouble, and that they are more numerous and more
                     rapid and more easy in consequence. And they do not go through any great
                     decomposition in the stomach, which arises not from their being indigestible,
                     but because we drink while eating them, without waiting for the action of the
                     stomach to soften them, and also because they pass through the stomach so
                     quickly. And they generate a salt juice in the stomach, because it has been
                     already shown that they contain something of nitre in them: and they will make
                     that food taste rather salt and harsh which is combined with them. For salt
                     increases the briny taste of anything, but vinegar and thyme increase the harsh
                     qualities of food.</quote>

               <p>Now Heraclides the Tarentine asks this question; <quote>Whether it is best to
                     drink warm water or cold after the eating of figs?</quote>And he says, that
                  those who recommend the drinking of cold water do so because they have an eye to
                  such a fact as this,—that warm water cleanses one's hands more quickly than cold;
                  on which account it is reasonable to believe that food in the stomach will be
                  quickly washed away by warm water. And with respect to figs which are not eaten,
                  warm water dissolves their consistency and connexion, and separates them into
                  small pieces; but cold coagultes and consolidates them. But those who recommend
                  the drinking of cold water say, the taking of cold water bears down by its own
                  weight the things which are heavy on the stomach; (for figs do not do any
                  extraordinary good to the stomach, since they <pb n="v.1.p.134"/> heat it and
                  destroy its tone; on which account some people always drink neat wine after them;)
                  and then too it quickly expels what is already in the stomach. But after eating
                  figs, it is desirable to take an abundant and immediate draught of something or
                  other; in order to prevent those things from remaining in the stomach, and to move
                  them into the lower parts of the bowels.</p>

                  but full of bad juice, nevertheless easily secreted, and rising easily to the
                  surface; and that these are more easily managed than the dry figs; but that those
                  which are in season in the winter, being ripened by artificial means, are very
                  inferior: but that the best are those which are ripe at the height of the summer,
                  as being ripened naturally; and these have a great deal of juice; and those which
                  are not so juicy are still good for the stomach, though somewhat heavy. And the

                     Delphic apples, and such fruits, one ought to watch the opportunity when they
                     will have the juice which they contain, neither unripe on the one hand, nor
                     tainted on the other; nor too much dried up by the season.</quote> But
                  Demetrius the Scepsian, in the fifteenth book of the Trojan Preparation, says,

                  actor, and a man with a fine voice, by abstaining from figs for eighteen years

               <p>Apples are an universal fruit. Mnesitheus the Athe- nian, in his treatise on
                  Eatables, calls them Delphian apples; but Diphilus says, that <quote>those apples
                     which are green and which are not yet ripe, are full of bad juice, and are bad
                     for the stomach; but are apt to rise to the surface, and also to engender bile;
                     and they give rise to diseases, and produce sensations of shuddering. But of
                     ripe apples, he says, that the sweet ones are those with most juice, and that
                     they are the most easily secreted, because they have no great inflammatory
                     qualities. But that sharp apples have a more disagreeable and mischievous
                     juice, and are more astringent. And that those which have less sweetness are
                     still pleasant to the palate when eaten; and, on account of their having some
                     strengthening qualities, are better for the stomach. And moreover, that of this
                     fruit those which are in season in the summer have a juice inferior to the
                     others; but those which are ripe in the autumn have the better juice. And that
                     those which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρβίκλατα,</foreign> have a good
                     deal of sweetness combined with their invigorating properties, and are very

                     are not good for the stomach. But those which are called Mordianian are very
                     excellent, being produced in Apollonia, which is called Mordius; and they are
                     like those which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρβίκλατα,</foreign> But the
                     Cydonian apples, or quinces, some of which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρούθια,</foreign> are, as a general rule, better for the stomach than any

               </p>
               <p>But Glaucides asserts that the best of all fruits which grow upon trees are the
                  Cydonian apples, and those which are called phaulia, and strouthia. And
                  Philotimus, in his third <pb n="v.1.p.136"/> book, and also in his tenth book of
                  his treatise on Food, says— "Of apples, those which come in season in spring are
                  by far more indigestible than pears, whether they are both unripe, or whether they
                  are both ripe. But they have the properties of juicy fruits; the sharp apples, and
                  those which are not yet ripe, resembling those pears which have a harsher taste
                  and which are in a certain degree sour; and they diffuse over the body a juice
                  which is said to be corrosive. And, as a general rule, apples are not so
                  digestible as pears; on which account those who are less addicted to eating them
                  are less troubled with indigestions, and those who are most fond of them are the
                  most liable to such inconvenience. But, as I said before, a corrosive juice is
                  engendered by them, as is stated by Praxagoras, and as is shown by the fact that
                  those things which are not digested will have the juice thicker. (And I have
                  already said that, as a general rule, apples are less digestible than pears.) And
                  the harsh and sour apples are in the habit of engendering thicker juices.</p>
               <p>But of those apples which are in season in the winter, the Cydonian give out the
                  more bitter juices, and those called strouthian give out juice more sparingly;
                  though what they do give out is not so harsh tasted, and is more digestible." But
                  Nicander of Thyatira says, that the Cydonian apples themselves are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρούθεια</foreign>; but he says this out of ignorance. For
                  Glaucides asserts plainly enough that the best of all fruits which grow on trees
                  are the Cydonian apples and those called phaulian and strouthian.</p>

                  afterwards it was ascertained, by an investigation and examination of the man who
                  had sold the poison; and that he felt sure that it arose from the fact of the

                     the almond, the nut, the date, and other fruits of the same kind; except the
                     walnut, in which that is not at all the case; and with the exception also of
                     the pomegranate and of the female pear.</quote> But Diphilus of Siphnos, in his
                  book about What should be eaten by People when Sick and by People in Health,"
                     says—<quote>The fruit called the Persian apple or peach, and by some the
                     Persian cuckoo-apple, is moderately juicy, but is more nutritious than
                     apples.</quote> But Philotimus, in the second and third books of his treatise
                  on Food, says that the Persian nut or walnut is more oily and like millet, and
                  that being a looser fruit, when it is pressed it yields a great quantity of oil.
                  But Aristophanes the grammarian, in his Lacedæmonian Dialects, says that the
                  Lacedæmonians call the cuckoo-apples Persian bitter apples; and that some people
                  call them <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδρυα.</foreign>

               <p>The Citron was next mentioned.—And with respect to this fruit there was a great
                  discussion among the Deipnosophists, as to whether there is any mention made of it
                  by the ancients. For Myrtilus said, proposing, as it were, to send us who made the
                  inquiry to feed among the wild goats, that Hegesander the Delphian, in his
                  Memorials, does make mention of this fruit; but that he did not recollect the
                  exact words: and Plutarch, contradicting him, said,—But I indeed contend, that
                  Hegesander never mentions the citron at all, for I read through the whole of his
                  Memorials for the express purpose of seeing whether he did or no; since some other
                  of our companions also asserted positively that he did, trusting to some
                  scholastic commentaries of a man whom he considered respectable enough. So that it
                  is time for you, my good friend Myrtilus, to seek for some other witness. But
                  Aemilianus said, that Jobas the king of the Mauritanians, a man of the most
                  extensive learning, in his History of Libya, does mention the citron, saying that
                  it is called among the Libyans the Hesperian apple, and that they were citrons
                  which Hercules carried into Greece, and which obtained the name of <hi rend="italics">golden</hi> apples on account of their colour and appearance.
                  But the fruit which is called the apples of the Hesperides, is said to have been
                  produced by Terra, on the occasion of the marriage of Jupiter and Juno, according
                  to the statement of Asclepiades, in the sixtieth book of his History of the
                  Affairs of Egypt. On this, Democritus, looking towards the speakers, said,—If,
                  indeed, Jobas asserts any of these things, let him take pleasure in his Libyan
                  books, and in the nonsense of Hanno. But I repeat the assertion, that the name <hi rend="italics">citron</hi> does not occur in the old authors. But the fruit
                  which is described by Theophrastus the Eresian, in his Histories of Plants, is
                  described in such a manner as to compel me to believe that he intended the citron
                  by what he said.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="26">
               <p>For that philosopher says, in the fourth book of his History of Plants—<quote>The
                     Median territory, and like wise the Persian, has many other productions, and
                     also the Perian or Median apple. Now, that tree has a leaf very like and almost
                     exactly the same as that of the bay-tree, the arbutus, or the nut: and it has
                     thorns like the prickly-pear, or blackthorn, smooth but very sharp and strong.
                     And the fruit is not good to eat, but is very fragrant, and so too are <pb n="v.1.p.140"/> the leaves of the tree. And if any one puts one of the
                     fruits among his clothes, it keeps them from the moth. And it is useful when
                     any one has taken poison injurious to life; for when given in wine it produces
                     a strong effect on the bowels, and draws out the poison. It is serviceable also
                     in the way of making the breath sweet; for if any one boils the inner part of
                     the fruit in broth or in anything else, and then presses it in his mouth and
                     swallows it, it makes his breath smell sweet. And the seed is taken out and is
                     sown in spring in square beds, being very carefully cultivated; and then it is
                     watered every fourth or fifth day; and when it has grown up it is again
                     transplanted the next spring into a place where the ground is soft, and
                     well-watered, and not very thin. And it bears fruit every year; some of which
                     are fit to be gathered, and some are in flower, and some are becoming ripe at
                     the same time. And those of the flowers which have a stem like a distaff
                     projecting out of the centre are sure to produce good seed; but those which
                     have no such stem are unproductive.</quote> And in the first book of the same
                  treatise he says the same thing about the distaff, and about the flowers which are
                  productive. And I am induced by these things, my mates, and by what Theophrastus
                  says of the colour and smell and leaves of the fruit, to believe that the fruit
                  meant by him is the citron; and let no one of you marvel if he says that it is not
                  good to eat; since until the time of our grandfathers no one was used to eat it,
                  but they put it away as a treasure in their chests along with their clothes.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="28">
               <p>However, Phænias the Eresian compels us to entertain the idea that, perhaps, the
                  name may be meant for <hi rend="italics">cedron,</hi> as from the cedar-tree. For,
                  in the fifth book of his treatise on Plants, he says that the cedar has thorns
                  around its leaves; and that the same is the case with the citron is visible to
                  everybody. But that the citron when eaten before any kind of food, whether dry or
                  moist, is an antidote to all injurious effects, I am quite certain, having had
                  that fact fully proved to me by my fellow-citizen, who was entrusted with the
                  government of Egypt. He had condemned some men to be given to wild beasts, as
                  having been convicted of being malefactors, and such men he said were only fit to
                  be given to beasts. And as they were going into the theatre appropriated to the
                  punishment of robbers, a woman who was selling fruit by the wayside gave them out
                  of pity some of the citron which she herself was eating, and they took it and ate
                  it, and after a little while, being exposed to some enormous and savage beasts,
                  and bitten by asps, they suffered no injury. At which the governor was mightily
                  astonished. And at last, examining the soldier who had charge of them, whether
                  they had eaten or drunk anything, when he learnt of him that some citron had been
                  given to them without any evil design; on the next day he ordered some citron to
                  be given o some of them again, and others to have none given to them And <pb n="v.1.p.142"/> those who eat the citron, though they were bitten, received no
                  injury, but the others died immediately on being bitten. And this result being
                  proved by repeated experiments, it was found that citron was an antidote to all
                  sorts of pernicious poison. But if any one boils a whole citron with its seed in
                  Attic honey, it is dissolved in the honey, and he who takes two or three mouthfuls
                  of it early in the morning will never experience any evil effects from poison.</p>

                  the strictest truth and who expended a great deal of money on the most accurate
                  investigation of matters to be spoken of in his History. For he says, in the
                  thirty-eighth book of his History, while giving an account of Clearchus, the
                  tyrant of the Heracleans who were in Pontus, that he seized violently upon a

                     as,</quote> says he, <quote>they all knew that he was in the habit of
                     compelling them to pledge him in this liquor, they never left their homes
                     without first eating rue: for people who have eaten this beforehand take no
                     harm from drinking aconite,— a poison which, they say, has its name from
                     growing in a place called Aconæ, which is not far from Heraclea.</quote> When
                  Democritus had said this they all marvelled at the efficacy of citron, and most of
                  them ate it, as if they had had nothing to eat or drink before. But Pamphilus, in

               <p>Diodes the Carystian, in his treatise on the Whole- somes, says that the best of
                  all shell-fish, as aperient and diuretic food, are mussels, oysters, scallops, and
                  cockles. And Archippus says, in his poem called <quote>Fishes,</quote> — <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>With limpets and sea-urchins and escharæ,</l>

                  </quote> And Diocles says that the strongest of all shell-fish are cockles,
                  purple-fish, and ceryces. But concerning ceryces Archippus says this— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The ceryx, ocean's nursling, child of purple.</l>
                  </quote> But Speusippus, in the second book of his Similarities, says that
                  ceryces, purple-fish, strabeli, and cockles, are all very nearly alike. And
                  Sophocles makes mention of the shellfish called strabeli in his Camici, in these
                  words:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  the periwinkle, the mussel, the pinna, the solens; and in another place he speaks
                  of oysters and limpets. And Araros says, in his Campylion— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Now Icesius says that limpets are more digestible than those shell-fish which have
                  been already mentioned; but that oysters are not so nutritious as limpets, and are
                  filling, but nevertheless are more digestible.</p>
               <p>But of mussels, the Ephesian ones, and those which resemble them, are, as to their
                  juicy qualities, superior to the periwinkles, but inferior to the cockles; but
                  they have more effect as diuretics than as aperients. But some of them are like
                  squills, with a very disagreeable juice, and with put any flavour; but there is a
                  kind which is smaller than they are, and which are rough outside, which are more
                  diuretic, and full of a more pleasant juice than the kind which resembles squills:
                  but they are less nutritious, by reason of their sizes, and also because their
                  nature is inferior. But the necks of <pb n="v.1.p.146"/> the ceryces are
                  exceedingly good for the stomach, and are not so nutritious as mussels and cockles
                  and periwinkles; but for people who have a weak stomach, and who do not easily
                  expel the food into the cavity of the bowels, they are useful, inasmuch as they do
                  not easily turn on the stomach. For those things which are confessedly digestible
                  are, on the contrary, very unwholesome for people of such a constitution, being
                  very easily inclined to turn on the stomach, because they are tender and easily
                  dissolved. On which account the bags containing their entrails are not suited to
                  vigorous stomachs, but they are very good for those whose bowels are in a weak
                  state. But what are more nutritious than the others, and far nicer in taste, are
                  the entrails of the purple-fish; though they certainly are somewhat like the
                  squill. For indeed all shellfish are of the same character; but the purple-fish
                  and the solen have this peculiar characteristic, that if they are boiled they
                  yield a thick juice. But the necks of the purple-fish, when boiled by themselves,
                  are exceedingly good for bringing the stomach into a good condition. And
                  Posidippus speaks of them in his Locrians in these terms:—</p>

               <p>Balani, if they are of the larger sort, are easily digested, and are good for the
                  stomach. But otaria (and they are produced in the island called Pharos, which is
                  close to Alexandria) are more nutritious than any of the before-mentioned fish,
                  but they are not easily secreted. But Antigonus the Carystian, in his book upon
                  Language, says that this kind of oyster is called by the Aeolians the Ear of
                  Venus. Pholades are very nutritious, but they have a disagreeable smell; but
                  common oysters are very like all these sorts of shell-fish, and are more
                  nutritious. There are also some kinds which are called wild oysters; and they are
                  very nutritious, but they have not a good smell, and moreover they have a very
                  indifferent flavour. But Aristotle, in his treatise about Animals, says, "Oysters
                  are of all the following kinds: there are the pinna, the mussel, the oyster, the
                  cteis, the solen, the cockle, the limpet, the small oyster, the balanus. And of
                  migratory fish there are the purple-fish, the sweet purple-fish, the sea-urchin,
                  the strobelus. Now the cteis has a rough shell, marked in streaks; <pb n="v.1.p.147"/> but the oyster has no streaks, and a smooth shell. The pinna
                  has a smooth mouth; but the large oyster has a vide mouth, and is bivalve, and has
                  a smooth shell. But the limpet is univalve, and has a smooth shell; and the mussel
                  has a united shell. The solen and balanus are univalve, and have a smooth shell;
                  and the cockle is a mixture of both kinds. Epænetus also says, in his Cookery
                  Book, that the interior part of the pinna is called mecon. But in the fifth book
                  of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, Aristotle says, <quote>The purple-fish
                     are born about spring, and the ceryces at the end of the winter. And
                     altogether,</quote> says he, <quote>all shell-fish appear in the spring to have
                     what are called eggs; and in the autumn, too, except those kinds of sea-urchins
                     which are good to eat. And these fish indeed have eggs in the greatest number
                     at those seasons, but they are never without them; and they have them in the
                     greatest numbers at the time of full moon, and in the warm weather, with the
                     exception of those fish which are found in the Euripus of the Pyrrhæans; for
                     they are best in the winter, and they are small, but full of eggs. And nearly
                     all the cockle tribe appear to breed in like manner at about the same
                     season.</quote>

               <p>And continuing the subject, the philosopher says again, <quote>The purple-fish
                     therefore being all collected together in the spring at the same place, make
                     what is called melicera. And that is something like honeycomb, but not indeed
                     so elegant, but it is as if a great number of the husks of white vetches were
                     fastened together; and there is no open passage in any of them: nor are the
                     purple-fish born of this melicera, but they, and nearly all other shell-fish,
                     are produced Of mud and putrefaction; and this is, as it were, a kind of
                     purification both for them and for the purple-fish, for they too make this
                     melicera. And when they begin to make it, they emit a sort of sticky mass, from
                     which those things grow which resemble husks. All these are eventually
                     separated, and they drop blood on the ground. And in the place where hey do so,
                     there are myriads of little purple-fish born, adhering to one another in the
                     ground, and the old purple-fish are caught while carrying them. And if they are
                     caught before they have produced their young, they sometimes produce them in
                     the very pots in which they are caught when collected together in them, and the
                     young look like a bunch of grapes. <pb n="v.1.p.148"/> And there are many
                     different kinds of purple-fish; and some of them are of large size, like those
                     which are found near Segeum and near Lesteum; and some are small, like those
                     which are found in the Euripus, and around Caria. And those in the gulfs are
                     large and rough, and most of them are of a black colour, but some of them are
                     rather red; and some of the large ones even weigh a mina. But those which are
                     found on the shore and around the coasts are of no great size, but are of a red
                     colour: and again, those in the waters exposed to the north wind are black, and
                     those in the waters exposed to the south wind are generally red.</quote>

               <p>But Apollodorus the Athenian, in his Commentaries on Sophron, having first quoted
                  the saying, <quote>More greedy than a purple-fish,</quote> says that it is a
                  proverb, and that some say that it applies to the dye of purple; for that whatever
                  that dye touches it attracts to itself, and that it imbues everything which is
                  placed near it with the brilliancy of its colour: but others say that it applies
                  to the animal. <quote>And they are caught,</quote> says Aristotle, "in the spring;
                  but they are not caught during the dog-days, for then they do not feed, but
                  conceal themselves and bury themselves in holes; and they have a mark like a
                  flower on them between the belly and the throat. The fish called the ceryx has a
                  covering of nearly the same sort as all the other animals of the snail kind from
                  its earliest birth; and they feed by putting out what we call their shell from
                  under this covering. And the purple-fish has a tongue of the size of a finger or
                  larger, by which it feeds; and it pierces even shell-fish, and can pierce its own
                  shell. But the purple-fish is very long-lived; and so is the ceryx: they live
                  about six years, and their growth is known by the rings in their shell. But
                  cockles, and cheme-cockles, and solens, and periwinkles, are born in sandy

               <p>But the pinnæ spring from the bottom of the sea. And they have with them a fish
                  called the pinnophylax, or guard of the pinna, which some call <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρίδιος,</foreign> and others <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρκίνιος</foreign>; and if they lose him, they are soon destroyed. But
                  Pamphilus the Alexandrian, in his treatise on Names, says that he is born at the
                  same time with the pinna. But Chrysippus the Solensian, in the fifth book of his
                  treatise on the Beautiful and Pleasure, says, <quote>The pinna and the guard of
                     the pinna assist one another, not being able to remain apart. <pb n="v.1.p.149"/> Now the pinna is a kind of oyster, but the guard of the
                     pinna is a small crab: and the pinna having opened its shell, remains quiet,
                     watching the fish who are coming towards it; but the guard of the pinna,
                     standing by when anything comes near, bites the pinna, so as to give it a sort
                     of sign; and the pinna being bitten, closes its shell, and in this manner the
                     two share together what is caught inside the pinna's shell. But some say that
                     the guard is born at the same time as the pinna, and that they originate in one
                     seed.</quote> And again, Aristotle says, <quote>All the fish of the oyster kind
                     are generated in the mud,—oysters in slimy mud, cockles in sandy mud, and so
                     on; but the small oyster and the balanus, and other fish which come near the
                     surface, such as limpets and periwinkles, are born in the fissures of the
                     rocks. And some fish which have not shells are born in the same way as those
                     which have shells,—as the sea-nettle, the sponge, and others, —in the crevices
                     of the rocks.</quote>

                  </quote> And Diphilus the Siphnian, a physician, says, <quote>But the sea-nettle
                        (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκαλήφη</foreign>) is good for the bowels, diuretic,
                     and a strengthener of the stomach, but it makes those who collect them itch
                     violently, unless they anoint their hands beforehand. And it is really
                     injurious to those who hunt for it; by whom it has been called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ακαλήφη,</foreign> by a slight alteration of its original name.
                     And perhaps that is the reason why the plant the nettle has had the same name
                     given to it. For it was named by euphemism on the principle of antiphrasis,—
                     for it is not gentle and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπαλὴ τῇ ἀφῇ,</foreign> tender

               <p>And concerning the rest of the oyster tribe, Diphilus says this: <quote>Of the
                     thick chemæ, those of smaller size, which have tender flesh, are called
                     oysters, and they are good for the stomach, and easily digested. But the thick
                     ones, which are called royal chemæ by some people, and which are also called
                     the huge chemæ are nutritious, slow to be digested, very juicy, good for the
                     stomach; and especially do these qualities belong to the larger ones. Of
                     tellinæ there are numbers in Canopus, and they are very common at the place
                     where the Nile begins to rise up to the higher ground. And the thinnest of
                     these are the royal ones, and they are digest- ible and light, and moreover
                     nutritious. But those which are taken in the rivers are the sweetest. Mussels,
                     again, are moderately nutritious, and are digestible and diuretic. But the best
                     are the Ephesian kind; and of them those which are taken about the end of
                     autumn. But the female mussel is smaller than the male, and is sweet and juicy,
                     and moreover nutritious. But the solens, as they are called by some, though
                     some call them <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖλοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόνακες,</foreign> or <hi rend="italics">pipes,</hi> and some, too, call
                     them <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνυχες,</foreign> or <hi rend="italics">claws,</hi>
                     are very juicy, but the juice is bad, and they are very glutinous. And the male
                     fish are striped, and not all of one colour; but they are very wholesome for
                     people affected with the stone, or with any complaint of the bladder. But the
                     female fish is all of one colour, and much sweeter than the male: and they are
                     eaten boiled and fried; but they are best of all when roasted on the coals till
                     their shells open.</quote> And the people who collect this sort of oyster are
                  called Solenistæ, as Phænias the Eresian relates in his book which is entitled,
                  The Killing of Tyrants by way of Punishment; where he speaks as
                     follows:—<quote>Philoxenus, who was called the Solenist, became a tyrant from
                     having been a de- magogue. In the beginning he got his livelihood by being <pb n="v.1.p.151"/> a fisherman and a hunter after solens; and so having made a
                     little money; he advanced, and got a good property.</quote> —<quote>Of the
                     periwinkle the white are the most tender, and they have no disagreeable smell,
                     and have a good effect on the bowels; but of the black and red kinds the larger
                     are exceedingly nice to the taste, especially those that are caught in the
                     spring. And as a general rule all of them are good for the stomach, and
                     digestible, and good for the bowels, when eaten with cinnamon and
                     pepper.</quote> Archippus also makes mention of them in his Fishes— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But the fish called balani, or acorns, because of their resemblance to
                  the acorn of an oak, differ according to the places where they are found. For the
                  Egyptian balani are sweet, tender, delicious to the taste, nutritious, very juicy
                  indeed, diuretic, and good for the bowels; but other kinds have a salter taste.
                  The fish called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤτια,</foreign> or ears, are most nutritious
                  when fried; but the pholades are exceedingly pleasant to the taste, but have a bad
                  smell, and an injurious juice.</p>

                     pleasant juice. But the sweet-tasted are the red ones, and the apple-coloured,
                     and the thickest, and those which if you scrape their flesh emit a milky
                     liquid. But those which are found near Cephalenia and around Icaria, and in the

                  sea-urchins were put before him on the table, took one, not knowing the proper
                  manner in which it should be eaten, and not attending to those who were in the
                  company to see how they ate it. And so he put it in his mouth with the skin or
                  shell and all, and began to crush the sea-urchin with, his teeth; and being
                  exceedingly disgusted with what he was eating, and not perceiving how to get rid
                  of the roughness of the taste, he said, <quote>O what nasty food! I will not now
                     be so effeminate as to eject it, but I will never take you again.</quote> But
                  the sea-urchins, and indeed the whole echinus tribe, whether living on land or
                  sea, can take care of and protect themselves against those who try to catch them,
                  putting out their thorns, like a sort of palisade. And to this Ion the Chian bears

                  <quote>Of limpets,</quote> says Diphilus, "some are very small, and some are like
                  oysters. But they are hard, and give but little juice, and are not very sharp in
                  taste. But they have a pleasant flavour, and are easily digested; and when boiled
                  they are particularly nice. But the pinnæ are diuretic, nutritious, not very
                  digestible, or manageable. And the ceryces are like them; the necks of which fish
                  are good for the stomach, but not very digestible; on which account they are good
                  for people with weak stomachs, as being strengthening; but they are difficult to
                  be secreted, and they are moderately nutritious. Now the parts of them which are
                  called the mecon, which are in the lower part of their bellies, are tender and
                  easily digested; on which account they also are good for people who are weak in
                  the stomach. But the purple-fish are something between the pinna and the ceryx;
                     <pb n="v.1.p.153"/> the necks of which are very juicy, and very pleasant to
                  the palate; but the other parts of them are briny, and yet sweet, and easily
                  digestible, and mix very well with other food. But oysters are generated in
                  rivers, and in lakes, and in the sea. But the best are those which belong to the
                  sea, when there is a lake or a river close at hand: for they are full of pleasant
                  juice, and are larger and sweeter than others: but those which are near the shore,
                  or near rocks, without any mixture of mud or water, are small, harsh, and of
                  pungent taste. But the oysters which 'are taken in the spring, and those which are
                  taken about the beginning of the summer, are better, and full, and have a sort of
                  sea taste, not unmixed with sweetness, and are good for the stomach and easily
                  secreted; and when boiled up with mallow, or sorrel, or with fish, or by
                  themselves, they are nutritious, and good for the bowels.</p>

               <p>But Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his treatise on Comestibles, says—"Oysters, and
                  cockles, and mussels, and similar things, are not very digestible in their meat,
                  because of a sort of saline moisture which there is in them, on which account,
                  when eaten raw, they produce an effect on the bowels by reason of their saltness.
                  But when boiled they get rid of all, or at all events of most, of their saltness,
                  which they infuse into the water which boils them. On which account, the water in
                  which any of the oyster tribe are boiled is very apt to have a strong effect in
                  disordering the bowels. But the meat of the oysters when boiled, makes a great
                  noise when it has been deprived of its moisture. But roasted oysters, when any one
                  roasts them cleverly, are very free from any sort of inconvenience; for all the
                  evil properties are removed by fire; on which account they are not as indigestible
                  as raw ones, and they have all the moisture which is originally contained in them
                  dried up; and the is the moisture which has too great an effect in relaxing the
                  bowels. But every oyster supplies a moist and somewhat in digestible kind of
                  nourishment, and they are not at all good as diuretics. But the sea-nettle, and
                  the eggs of sea-urchins, and such things as that, give a moist nourishment, though
                  not in any great quantity; but they have a tendency to relax the bowels, and they
                  are diuretic.</p>

                  ears as the cteis oyster has, but only one. The stone is engendered in the flesh
                  of the oyster, just as the measles are in pork. And it is of a very golden colour,
                  so as mot easily to be distinguished from gold when it is put by the side of it;
                  but some pearls are of a silvery appearance, and some are completely white like
                  the eyes of fish. But Chares of Mitylene, in the seventh book of his Histories of
                  Alexander, Says—<quote>There is caught in the Indian sea, and also off the coast
                     of Armenia, and Persia, and Susiana, and Babylonia, a fish very like an oyster;
                     and it is large and oblong, containing within the shell flesh which is
                     plentiful and white, and very fragrant, from which the men pick out white bones
                     which they call the pearl. And they make of them necklaces and chains for the
                     hands and feet, of which the Persians are very fond, as are the Medes and all
                     Asiatics, esteeming them as much more valuable than golden ornaments.</quote>

            <div type="chapter" n="46">
               <p>But Isidorus the Characene, in his Description of Parthia, says, that "in the
                  Persian sea there is an island where a great number of pearls are found; on which
                  account there are quantities of boats made of rushes all about the island, from
                  which men leap into the sea, and die down twenty fathoms, and bring up two shells.
                  And they say that when there is a long continuance of thunder-storms, and heavy
                  falls of rain, then the pinna produces most young, and then, too, the greatest
                  quantity of pearls is engendered, and those, too, of the finest size and quality.
                  In the winter <pb n="v.1.p.156"/> the pinna is accustomed to descend into
                  chambers at the very bottom of the sea; but in summer they swim about all night
                  with their shells open, which they close in the day-time: and as many as stick to
                  the crags, or rocks, throw out roots, and remaining fixed there, they generate
                  pearls. But they are supported and nourished by something which adheres to their
                  flesh: and this also sticks to the mouth of the cockle, having talons and bringing
                  it food: and it is something like a little crab, and is called the guardian of the
                  pinna. And its flesh penetrates through the centre of the cockleshell, like a
                  root: and the pearl being generated close to it, grows through the solid portion
                  of the shell, and keeps growing as long as it continues to adhere to the shell.
                  But when the flesh gets under the excrescence, and cutting its way onwards, gently
                  separates the pearl from the shell, then when the pearl is surrounded by flesh, it
                  is no longer nourished so far as to grow at all; but the flesh makes it smoother,
                  and more transparent, and more pure. And so, too, the pinna, which lives at the
                  bottom, engenders the most transparent sort of pearl; and it produces them also
                  very pure and of large size. But that which keeps near the surface, and is
                  constantly rising, is of a smaller size and a worse colour, because it is affected
                  by the rays of the sun. But those who hunt for pearls are in danger when they
                  hastily put their hand into the opening of the shell, for immediately the fish
                  closes its shell, and very often their fingers are sawn off; and sometimes they
                  die immediately. But all those who put in their hand sideways easily draw off the
                  shells from the rock. And Menander makes mention of Emeralds also, in his Little
                  Boy– <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There must be an emerald and a sardonyx.</l>
                  </quote> And the word for emerald is more correctly written <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάραγδος,</foreign> without a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>. For it is
                  derived from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαρμαίρω,</foreign> to glisten,
                  because it is a transparent stone.</p>

               <p>After this conversation some dishes were set on the table, full of many kinds of
                  boiled meat: feet, and head, and ears, and loins; and also entrails, and
                  intestines, and tongues; as is the custom at the places which are called boiled
                  meat shops at Alexandria. For, O Ulpian, the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑφθοπώλιον,</foreign> a boiled meat shop, is used by Posidippus, in his Little

               <p>Now when all this conversation had taken place on these subjects, the physicians

                  of Athens, he himself being a bastard, and usurped the kingdom. And in his time,
                  Melanthus the Messenian was banished from his country, and consulted the Pythia as
                  to where he should dwell: and she said wherever he was first honoured by gifts of
                  hospitality, when men set before him feet and a head for supper. And this happened
                  to him at Eleusis; for as the priestesses happened at the time to be solemnizing

                     female harpers, but they are able themselves to pass the time with one another

                  purloined from you by some bath robbers; so that there was great laughter in the

                  men asked him, What is the matter, O Ulpian? he said it was a black eye. And I
                  (for I was with him at the time) being then unable to restrain my laughter, got
                  anointed under the eyes with some thick ointment by a physician who was a friend
                  of mine, and then said to those who asked me, What is the matter with you, that I

                     <l>Are fraught with countless evil to mankind,</l>
                     <l>Such changes do they cause in all their food.</l>

                  Archestratus, in that famous poem of his where he never once mentions the crab by

                  </quote> And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, shows plainly that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄστακος</foreign> spoken of by Archestratus is the same as the

                  nymphe, the arctus, the carcinus, and the pagurus. And Diocles the Carystian says,
                     <quote>Carides, carcini, carabi, and astaci, are pleasant to the taste and
                     diuretic.</quote> And Epicharmus has also mentioned the colybdæna in the lines
                  I have quoted above; which Nicander calls the beauty of the sea; but Heraclides in
                  his Cookery Book gives that name to the caris. But Aristotle, in the fifth book of
                  his Parts of Animals, says, "Of soft-shelled animals the carabi, the astaci, the
                  carides, and others of the same sort, are propagated like quadrupeds; and they
                  breed at the beginning of spring; as indeed is no secret to anybody; but at times
                  they breed when the fig begins to ripen.</p>
               <p>Now carabi are found in rough and rocky places; but astaci in smooth ground;
                  neither kind in muddy places: on which account there are astaci produced in the
                  Hellespont and about Thasos; and carabi off Cape Sigeum and Mount Athos. But the
                  whole race of crabs is long-lived. But Theophrastus, in his book on Animals who
                  dive in Holes, <pb n="v.1.p.175"/> says that the astaci and carabi and carides
                  all cast off their old age.</p>

                  mentions him, in his seventh book, and Demetrius the comic writer speaks of him in

                  wheaten flour, the loaf made of groats, the loaf made of remnants (and this he
                  says is more digestible than that which is made only of the best flour), the loaf
                  made of rye, the loaf made of acorns, the loaf made of millet. The loaf made of
                  groats, said he, is made of oaten groats, for groats are not made of barley. And
                  from a peculiar way of baking or roasting it, there is a loaf called ipnites (or
                  the oven loaf) which Timocles mentions in his Sham Robbers, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     eating and are satisfied, then they introduce a most agreeable dish, which is
                     called the hearth-loaf, the best of all loaves; which is made of sweet things,
                     and compounded so as to be very soft, and it is made up with such an admirable
                     harmony of all the ingredients as to have a most excellent effect; so that
                     often a man who is drunk becomes sober again, and in the same way a man who has
                     just eaten to satiety is made hungry again by eating of it.</quote>

                  the Thesmophoria. They are loaves of a large size. And the festival is called

               <p>When the conversation had gone on this way, one of the grammarians present, whose
                  name was Arrian, said— This food is as old as the time of Saturn, my friends; for
                  we are not rejoicing in meal, for the city is full of bread, nor in all this
                  catalogue of loaves. But since I have fallen in with another treatise of
                  Chrysippus of Tyana, which is entitled a treatise on the Art of Making Bread; and
                  since I have had experience of the different recipes given in it at the houses <pb n="v.1.p.187"/> of many of my friends, I will proceed to say something my-
                  self also on the subject of loaves. The kind of loaf which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρτοπτίκινος,</foreign> differs in some respect from that made in
                  a pan, and from that made in an oven. But if you make it with hard leaven, it will
                  be bright and nice, so tat it may be eaten dry; but if it be made with a looser
                  leaven, then it will be light but not bright. But the loaf which s made in a pan,
                  and that which is made in an oven, require a softer kind of leaven. And among the
                  Greeks there is a kind of bread which is called tender, being made up with a
                  little milk and oil, and a fair quantity of salt; and one must make the dough for
                  this bread loose. And this kind of loaf is called the Cappadocian, since tender
                  bread is made in the greatest quantities in Cappadocia. But the Syrians call
                  loaves of this kind <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαχμὴ</foreign>; and it is the best
                  bread made in Syria, because it can be eaten hot; and it is like a flower. But
                  there is also a loaf called boletinus, from being made like a mushroom, and the
                  kneading-trough is smeared with poppies plastered over the bottom of it, on which
                  the dough is placed, and by this expedient it is prevented from sticking to the
                  trough while the leaven is mixed in. But when it is put in the oven, then some
                  groats are spread under on a tile, and then the bread is put on it, and it gets a
                  most beautiful colour, like cheese which has been smoked.</p>
               <p>There is also a kind of bread called strepticias, which is made up with a little
                  milk, and pepper and a little oil is added, and sometimes suet is substituted. And
                  a little wine, and pepper, and milk, and a little oil, or sometimes suet, is
                  employed in making the cake called artolaganum. But for making the cakes called
                  capuridia tracta, you mix the same ingredients that you do for bread, and the
                  difference is in the baking.</p>

               <p>So when the mighty sophist of Rome had enunciated these precepts of Aristarchus,
                  Cynulcus said—O Ceres, what a wise man! It is not without reason that the
                  admirable Blepsias has pupils as the sand of the sea in number, and has amassed
                  wealth from this excellent wisdom of his, beyond all that was acquired by Gorgias
                  or Protagoras. So that I am afraid, by the goddesses, to say whether he himself is
                  blind, or whether those who have entrusted his pupils to him have all but one eye,

                  eating a cheesecake at a banquet, say to some one who put the question to him,
                  that he was eating bread excellently well made? But as for you, you <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Stranglers of dishes of white paunches,</l>
                  </quote> as the same poet, Eubulus, says, you keep on speaking without ever giving
                  place to others; and you are never quiet until some one throws you a crust or a
                  bone, as he would do to a dog. How do you come to know that cubi (I do not mean
                  those which you are continually handling) are a kind of loaf, square, seasoned
                  with anise, and cheese, and oil, as Heraclides says in his Cookery Book? But
                  Blepsias overlooked this kind, as also he did the thargelus, which some call the
                  thalysius. But Crates, in the second book of his treatise on the Attic Dialect,
                  says that the thargelus is the first loaf made after the carrying home of the
                  harvest. The loaf made of sesame he had never seen, nor that which is called
                  anastatus, which is made for the Arrephori.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">

                  first book of his treatise on Plants, as he also does those which are called
                  thiagones. And these last are loaves made for the gods in Aetolia. There are also

               <p>And the writers of books on dialects give lists of the names of different loaves.

                  and of another called daratus by the Thessalians. And he speaks of the etnites,

                  made of the yolks of eggs and of pulse. And he says that the loaf called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρικίτης,</foreign> has its name from being made of wheat crushed
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρηριγμένος</foreign>), and not sifted, and of groats.
                  And Amerias speaks of a loaf called xeropyrites, made of pure wheat, and nothing
                  else; and so does Tima- chidas. But Nicander says that thiagones is the name given
                  by the Aetolians to those loaves which are made for the gods. The Egyptians have a

                  brattime, which Amerias. and Timachidas call euconon or teuconon. But Philetas, in

               <p>Now you may find barley-cakes mentioned in his writings by Tryphon, and by many
                  other authors. Among the Athenians it is called phystes, not being too closely
                  kneaded. There is also the cardamale, and the berx, and the tolype, and the
                  Achilleum; and perhaps that is a cake which is made of the Achillean barley. Then
                  there is the <pb n="v.1.p.190"/> thridakina, so named from lettuce, the œnutta,
                  so called from wine; the melitutta, from honey; and the crinon, the name of which
                  is derived from the lily, which last is also the name of a choral dance, mentioned
                  by Apollophanes, in the Dalis. But the cakes called thridaciscæ by Alcman, are the
                  same as the Attic thridacinæ. But Alcman speaks thus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The thridacisca, and the cribanotus.</l>
                  </quote> And Sosibius, in the third book of his essay on Alcman, says, that
                  cribana is a name given to a peculiar kind of cheesecake, in shape like a breast.
                  But the barley cake, which is given in sacrifices to be tasted by the sacrificers,
                  is called hygea. And there is also one kind of barley cake which is called by
                  Hesiod amolgsæa. <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And Ulpian said—By whom is the word freedman (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπελεύθερος</foreign>) ever used? And when some one replied that there was a
                  play with that title—namely, the Freedman of Phrynichus, and that Menander, in his
                  Beaten Slave, had the word freedwoman (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπελευθέρα</foreign>), and was proceeding to mention other instances; he asked

               <p>And Galen, when we were just about to lay hands on the loaves, said—We will not
                  begin supper until you have heard what the sons of the Asclepiadæ have said about
                  loaves, and cheesecakes, and meal, and flour. Diphilus the Siphnian, <pb n="v.1.p.191"/> in his treatise on What is Wholesome to be eaten by People in
                  Health and by Invalids, says, <quote>Loaves made of wheat are by far more
                     nutritious and by far more digestible than those made of barley, and are in
                     every respect superior to them; and the next best are those which are made of
                     similago; and next to those come the loaves made of sifted flour, and next to
                     them those called syncomisti, Which are made of unsifted meal;—for these appear
                     to be more nutritious.</quote> But Philistion the Locrian says <quote>that the
                     loaves made of similago are superior to those made of groats, as far as their
                     strengthening properties go; and next to them he ranks loaves made of groats,
                     then those made of sifted flour. But the rolls made of bran give a much less
                     wholesome juice, and are by far less nutritious. And all bread is more
                     digestible when eaten hot than cold, and it is also more digestible then, and
                     affords a pleasanter and more wholesome juice; nevertheless, hot bread is apt
                     to cause flatulence, though it is not the less digestible for that; while cold
                     bread is filling and indigestible. But bread which is very stale and cold is
                     less nutritious, and is apt to cause constipation of the bowels, and affords a
                     very unpleasant juice. The bread called encryphiasis is heavy and difficult of
                     digestion, because it is not baked in an equal manner; but that which is called
                     ipnites and caminites is indigestible and apt to disagree with people. That
                     called escharites, and that which is fried, is more easily secreted because of
                     the admixture of oil in it, but is not so good for the stomach, on account of
                     the smell which there is about it. But the bread called 'the clibanites' has
                     every possible good quality; for it gives a pleasant and wholesome juice, and
                     is good for the stomach, and is digestible, and agrees exceedingly well with
                     every one, for it never clogs the bowels, and never relaxes them too

                     the most easily digested of all food. But bread which is made of rye, if it be

               <p>And Icesius says, in the second book of hi treatise on the Materials of
                  Nourishment, that pelamydes are a large kind of cybium. And Posidippus speaks of
                  the cybium, in his Transformed. But Euthydemus, in his treatise on Salt Fish, says
                  that the fish called the Delcanus is so named from the river Delcon, where it is
                  taken; and then, when pickled and salted, it is very good indeed for the stomach.
                  But Dorion, in his book on Fishes, calls the leptinus the lebianus, and says,
                  "that some people say that is the same fish as the delcanus; and that the
                  ceracinus is called by man people the saperdes; and that the best are those which
                  come from the Palus Mæotis. And he says that the mullet which are caught about
                  Abdera are excellent; and next to them, those which are caught near Sinope; and
                  that they, when pickled and salted, are very good for the stomach. But those, he
                  says, which are called mulli are by some people called agnotidia, and by some
                  platistaci, though they are all the same fish; as also is the chellares. For that
                  he, being but one fish, has received a great variety of names; for that he is
                  called a bacchus, and an oniscus, and a chellares. And those of the larger size
                  are called platistaci, and those of riddle size mulli, and those which are but
                  small are called agnotidia. But Aristophanes also mentions the mulli, in his

                  fish which have been already mentioned, and which your elegant Archestratus speaks
                  of; but, however, Sopater the Paphian has mentioned the heminerus, in his Slave of

                  said, holding up both his hands,— Heraclides of Tarentum, my friends, in his
                  treatise entitled The Banquet, says, "It is good to take a moderate quantity of
                  food before drinking, and especially to eat such dishes as one is accustomed to;
                  for from the eating of things which have not been eaten for a long time the wine
                  is apt to be turned sour, so as not to sit on the stomach, and many twinges and
                  spasms are often originated. But some people think that these also are bad for the
                  stomach; I mean, all kinds of vegetables and salted fish, since they possess
                  qualities apt to cause pangs; but that glutinous and invigorating food is the most
                  wholesome,—being ignorant that a great many of the things which assist the
                  secretions are, on the contrary, very good for the stomach; among which is the
                  plant called sisarum, (which Epicharmus speaks of, in his Agrostinus, and also in
                  his Earth and Sea; and so does Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on the
                  Wholesomes;) and asparagus and white beet, (for the black beet is apt to check the
                  secretions,) and cockles, and solens, and sea mussels, and chemæ, and periwinkles,
                  and perfect pickles, and salt-fish, which are void of <pb n="v.1.p.199"/> smell,
                  and many kinds of juicy fishes. And it is good that, before the main dinner, there
                  should be served up what is called salad, and beet-root, and salt-fish, in order
                  that by having the edge of our appetite taken off we may go with less eagerness to
                  what is not equally nutritious. But at the beginning of dinner it is best to avoid
                  abundant draughts; for they are bad as generating too great a secretion of humous

                     whether caught in the sea, or in the lake, or in the river, are not very
                     nourishing, nor very juicy; but are inflammatory, and act strongly on the
                     bowels, and are provocative of desire. But the best of them are those Which are
                     made of animals devoid of fat, such as cybia, and horæa, and other kinds like
                     them. And of fat fish, the best are the different kinds of tunny, and the young
                     of the tunny; for the old ones are larger and harsher to the taste; and above
                     all, the Byzantine tunnies are so. But the tunny, says he, is the same as the
                     larger pelamys, the small kind of which is the same as the cybium, to which
                     species the horæum also belongs. But the sarda is of very nearly the same size
                     as the colias. And the scombrus is a light fish, and one which the stomach
                     easily gets rid of; but the colias is a glutinous fish, very like a squill, and
                     apt to give twinges, and has an inferior juice, but nevertheless is nutritious.
                     And the best are those which are called the Amyclæan, and the Spanish, which is
                     also called the Saxitan; for they are lighter and sweeter.</quote>

                     indigestible. But the river coracinus, which some people call the peltes, the
                     one from the Nile, I mean, which the people at Alexandria have a peculiar name
                     for, and call the heminerus, is rather fat, and has a juice which is far from
                     disagreeable; it is fleshy, nutritious, easily digestible, not apt to disagree
                     with one, and in every respect superior to the mullet. Now the roe of every
                     fish, whether fresh or dried and salted, is indigestible and apt to disagree.
                     And the most so of all is the roe of the more oily and larger fish; for that
                     remains harder for a long time, and is not decomposed. But it is not
                     disagreeable to the taste when seasoned with salt and roasted. Every one,
                     however, ought to soak dried and salted fish until the water becomes free from
                     smell, and sweet. But dried sea-fish when boiled becomes sweeter; and they are
                     sweeter too when eaten hot than cold.</quote> And Mnesitheus the Athenian, in
                  his treatise on Comestibles, says, <quote>Those juices which are salt, and those
                     which are sweet, all have an effect in relaxing the bowels; but those which are
                     sharp and harsh are strongly diuretic. Those too which are bitter are generally
                     diuretic, but some of them also relax the bowels. Those which are sour,

                  and among those prose writers who pique themselves on the purity of their Greek,
                  you may find some Persian nouns, because of their having got into a habit of using

                  either as a masculine or feminine noun, and it is a measure on the road, which
                  retains even to this day that Persian name with many people. I know, too, that

                  moderation; and also, the celebrated line of Euripides about the tongue having

                     an abundant draught; but if the thirst be small, then the man will wish for but
                     a small draught. But the thirst itself is not a desire of anything except of
                     the thing itself, namely, drinking. And hunger, again, is not a desire of

                  acquainted with the fashion of drinking snow. But Chares of Mitylene, in his

                  he is relating the siege of the Indian city Petra. For he says that Alexander dug
                  thirty large trenches close to one anther, and filled them with snow, and then he
                  heaped on the snow branches of oak; for that in that way snow would last a long
                  time.</p>

                     the house, and two slaves are kept sprinkling the vessels with water the whole
                     night. And at daybreak they bring them down, and again they skim off the
                     sediment, making the water very thin, and exceedingly wholesome, and then they
                     immerse the ewers in straw, and after that they use the water, which has become
                     so cold as not to require snow to cool it.</quote> And Anaxilas speaks of water

               <p>After this a cheesecake was served up, made of milk and sesame and honey, which
                  the Romans call libum. And Cynulcus said,—Fill yourself now, O Ulpian, with your
                  native Chthorodlapsus; a word which is not, I swear by Ceres, used by any one of
                  the ancient writers, unless, indeed, it should chance to be found in those who
                  have compiled histories of the affairs of Phœnicia, such as Sanchoniatho and
                  Mochus, your own fellow-countrymen. And Ulpian said,— But it seems to me, you
                  dog-fly, that we have had quite enough of honey-cakes: but I should like to eat
                  some groats, with a sufficient admixture of the husks and kernels of pinecones.
                  And when that dish was brought-Give me, said he, come crust of bread hollowed out
                  like a spoon; for I will not say, give me a spoon (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μύστρον</foreign>); since that word is not used by any of the writers previous
                  to our own time. You have a very bad memory, my friend, quoth Aemilianus; have you
                  not always admired Nicander the Colophonian, the Epic poet, as a man very fond of
                  ancient authors, and a man too of very extensive learning himself? And indeed, you
                  have already quoted him as having used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεπέριον,</foreign> for <hi rend="italics">pepper.</hi> And this same poet, in
                  the first book of his Georgics, speaking of this use of groats, has used also the

                  </quote> In these words, my fine fellow, Nicander describes to us the way in which
                  they ate groats and peeled barley; bidding the eater pour on it soup made of kid
                  or lamb, or of some poultry or other. Then, says he, pound the grains in a mortar,
                  and having mingled oil with them, stir them up till they boil; and mix in the
                  broth made after this recipe as it gets warm, making it thicker with the spoon;
                  and do not pour in anything else; but take the broth out of the dish before you,
                  so as to guard against any of the more fatty parts boiling over. And it is for
                  this reason, too, that he charges us to keep it close while it is boiling, by
                  putting the lid on the dish; for that barley grains when roasted or heated swell
                  very much. And at last, when it is moderately warm we are to eat it, taking it up
                  in hollow spoons.</p>
               <p>And Hippolochus the Macedonian, in his letter to Lynceus, in which he gives an
                  account of some Macedonian banquet which surpassed all the feasts which had ever

                  speaking of spoons, and using the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύστρον,</foreign>

               <p>HIPPOLOCHUS the Macedonian, my friend Timocrates, lived in the time of Lynceus and
                  Douris of Samos, pupils of Theophrastus<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Theophrastus was a disciple of Aristotle, and succeeded him as head of the
                     Lyceum, so that this time would be about 310 B.C.</note> the Eresian. And he
                  had made a bargain with Lynceus, as one may learn from his letters, that if ever
                  he was present at any very expensive banquet, he would relate to him the whole of
                  the preparations which were made; and Lynceus in return made him the same promise.
                  And there are accordingly some letters of each of them on the subject of banquets;
                  in which Lynceus relates the banquet which was given at Athens by Lamia the Attic
                  female flute-player to King Demetrius, surnamed Poliorcetes, (and Lamia was the
                  mistress of Demetrius.) And Hippolochus reports the marriage feast of Caranus the
                  Macedonian. And we have also met with other letters of Lynceus, written to the
                  same Hippolochus, giving an account of the banquet of King Antigonus, when he
                  celebrated the Aphrodisian festival at Athens, and also that given by King
                  Ptolemy. And I will show you the very letters themselves. But as the letter of
                  Hippolochus is very scarce, I will run over to you the principal things which are
                  contained in it, just for the sake of conversation and amusement at the present
                  time.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="2">
               <p>In Macedonia, then, as I have said, Caranus made a marriage feast; and the guests
                  invited were twenty in number. And as soon as they had sat down, a silver bowl was
                  given to each of them as a present. And Caranus had previously crowned every one
                  of them, before they entered the dining-room, with a golden chaplet, and each
                  chaplet was valued at five pieces of gold. And when they had emptied <pb n="v.1.p.211"/> the bowls, then there was given to each of the guests a loaf
                  in a brazen platter of Corinthian workmanship, of the. same size; and poultry, and
                  ducks, and besides that, pigeons, and a goose, and quantities more of the same
                  kind of food heaped up abundantly. And each of the guests taking what was set
                  before him, with the brazen platter itself also, gave it to the slaves who waited
                  behind him. Many other dishes of various sorts were also served up to eat. And
                  after them, a second platter was placed before each guest, made of silver, on
                  which again there was placed a second large loaf, and on that geese, and hares,
                  and kids, and other rolls curiously made, and doves, and turtledoves, and
                  partridges, and every other kind of bird imaginable, in the greatest abundance.
                  Those also, says Hippolochus, we gave to the slaves; and when we had eaten to
                  satiety, we washed our hands, and chaplets were brought in in great numbers, made
                  of all sorts of flowers from all countries, and on each chaplet a circlet of gold,
                  of about the same weight as the first chaplet. And Hippolochus having stated after
                  this that Proteas, the descendant of that celebrated Proteas the son of Lanice,
                  who had been the nurse of Alexander the king, was a most extraordinary drinker, as
                  also his grandfather Proteas, who was the friend of Alexander, had been; and that
                  he pledged every one present, proceeds to write as follows:—</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="3">
               <p>"And while we were now all amusing ourselves with agreeable trifling, some
                  flute-playing women and musicians, and some Rhodian players on the sambuca come
                  in, naked as I fancied, but some said that they had tunics on. And they having
                  played a prelude, departed; and others came in in succession, each. of them
                  bearing two bottles of perfume, bound with a golden thong, and one of the cruets
                  was silver and the other gold, each holding a cotyla,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A cotyla held about half a pint.</note> and they presented them
                  to each of the guests. And then, instead of supper, there was brought in a great
                  treasure, a silver platter with a golden edge of no inconsiderable depth, of such
                  a size as to receive the entire bulk of a roast boar of huge size, which lay in it
                  on his back, showing his belly uppermost, stuffed with many good things. For in
                  the belly there were roasted thrushes, and paunches, and a most countless number
                  of fig peckers, and the yolks of eggs spread on the top, and oysters, and <pb n="v.1.p.212"/> periwinkles. And to every one of the guests was presented a
                  boar stuffed in this way, nice and hot, together with the dish on which he was
                  served up. And after this we drank wine, and each of us received a hot kid, on
                  another platter like that on which the boar had been served up, with some golden
                  spoons. Then Caranus seeing that we were cramped for the want of room, ordered
                  canisters and bread-baskets to be given to each of us, made of strips of ivory
                  curiously plaited together; and we were very much delighted at all this, and
                  applauded the bridegroom, by whose means we were thus enabled to preserve what had
                  been given to us. Then chaplets were again brought to us, and another pair of
                  cruets of perfume, one silver and one gold, of the same weight as the former pair,
                  And when quiet was restored, there entered some men, who even in the Potfeast<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Held on the thirteenth day of the month
                     Anthesterion; being the first day of the great festival Anthesteria.</note> at
                  Athens had borne a part in the solemnities, and with them there came in some
                  ithyphallic dancers, and some jugglers, and some conjuring women also, tumbling
                  and standing on their heads on swords, and vomiting fire out of their mouths, and
                  they, too, were naked.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="4">
               <p>And when we were relieved from their exhibition, then we had a fresh drink offered
                  to us, hot and strong, and Thasian, and Mendæan, and Lesbian wines were placed
                  upon the board, very large golden goblets being brought to every one of us. And
                  after we had drunk, a glass goblet of two cubits in diameter, placed on a silver
                  stand, was served up, full of roast fishes of every imaginable sort that could be
                  collected. And there was also given to every one a silver breadbasket full of
                  Cappadocian loaves; some of which we ate and some we delivered to the slaves
                  behind us. And when we had washed our hands, we put on chaplets; and then again we
                  received golden circlets twice as large as the former ones, and another pair of
                  cruets of perfume. And when quiet was restored, Proteas leaping up from his couch,
                  asked for a cup to hold a gallon; and having filled it with Thasian wine, and
                  having mingled a little water with it, he drank it off, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He who drinks most will be the happiest.</l>
                  </quote> And Caranus said—<quote>Since you have been the first to drink, do you be
                     the first also to accept the cup as a gift; and this <pb n="v.1.p.213"/> also
                     shall be the present for all the rest who drink too.</quote> And when this had
                  been said, at once nine of the guests rose up snatching at the cups, and each one
                  trying to forestall the other. But one of those who were of the party, like an
                  unlucky man as he was, as he was unable to drink, sat down and cried because he
                  had no goblet; and so Caranus presented him with an empty goblet. After this, a
                  dancing party of a hundred men came in, singing an epithalamium in beautiful tune.
                  And after them there came in dancing girls, some arranged so as to represent the
                  Nereids, and others in the guise of the nymphs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="5">
               <p>And as the drinking went on, and the shadows were beginning to fall, they opened
                  the chamber where everything was encircled all round with white cloths. And when
                  these curtains were drawn, the torches appeared, the partitions having been
                  secretly removed by mechanism. And there were seen Cupids, and Dianas, and Pans,
                  and Mercuries, and numbers of statues of that kind, holding torches in silver
                  candlesticks. And while we were admiring the ingenuity of the contrivance, some
                  real Erymanthean boars were brought round to each of the guests on square platters
                  with golden edges, pierced through and through with silver darts. And what was the
                  strangest thing of all was, that those of us who were almost helpless and
                  stupefied with wine, the moment that we saw any of these things which were brought
                  in, became all in a moment sober, standing upright, as it is said. And so the
                  slaves crammed them into the baskets of good omen, until the usual signal of the
                  termination of the feast sounded. For you know that that is the Macedonian custom
                  at large parties.</p>
               <p>And Caranus, who had begun drinking in small goblets, ordered the slaves to bring
                  round the wine rapidly. And so we drank pleasantly, taking our present liquor as a
                  sort of antidote to our previous hard drinking. And while we were thus engaged,
                  Mandrogenes the buffoon came in, the descendant, as is reported, of that
                  celebrated Strato t e Athenian, and he caused us much laughter. And after this he
                  danced with his wife, a woman who was already more than eighty years of age. And
                  at last the tables, to wind up the whole entertainment, were brought in. And
                  sweetmeats in plaited baskets made of ivory were distributed to every one. <pb n="v.1.p.214"/> And cheesecakes of every kind known, Cretan cheesecakes, and
                  your Samian ones, my friend Lynceus, and Attic ones, with the proper boxes, or
                  dishes, suitable to each kind of confection. And after this we all rose up and
                  departed, quite sobered, by Jove, by the thoughts of, and our anxiety about, the
                  treasures which we had received.</p>
               <p>But you who never go out of Athens think yourself happy when you hear the precepts
                  of Theophrastus, and when you eat thyme, and salads, and nice twisted loaves,
                  solemnizing the Lenæan festival, and the Potfeast at the Anthesteria. But at the
                  banquet of Caranus, instead of our portions of meat, we carried off actual riches,
                  and are now looking, some for houses, and some for lands, and some of us are
                  seeking to buy slaves."</p>

                  </quote> And Chrysippus, in the fourth book of his treatise on Beauty and
                  Pleasure, says—<quote>But at Athens they say that two festivals are celebrated
                     there (neither of them of great antiquity), one at the Lyceum and one in the
                     Academy, and when the confectioner had brought into the Academy a dish for some
                     other purpose, all those who were offering sacrifice at once broke the dish,
                     because something had been introduced which did not belong to the city, and
                     everything which came from afar ought to have been kept away. And that the cook
                     at the Lyceum having prepared some Salt-fish in order to serve up a dish of it,
                     was scourged as a man who used his invention in a very wicked manner.</quote>
                  And Plato, in the second book of his Republic, represents his new citizens as
                  feasting, and writes—<quote>You make your men feast without any second course,
                     says he. You say the truth, I replied; I forgot that they will have a second
                     course-namely, salt, and olives, and cheese, and onions; and besides, they will
                     boil such vegetables as are found in the fields; and moreover, we shall serve
                     up some sweetmeats to them,—figs, and beans, and vetches. They shall roast
                     myrtle-berries too and beechc <pb n="v.1.p.224"/> acorns at the fire, drinking
                     moderately all the time. And in this manner they shall pass their lives in
                     peace, growing old, as it is probable they will, in the enjoyment of good
                     health, and transmit a good constitution to their posterity.</quote>

               <p>We must next speak of the Lacedæmonian banquets. Now Herodotus, in the ninth book
                  of his Histories, speaking of the preparation of Mardonius, and mentioning the
                  banquets of the Lacedæmonians, says—<quote>Xerxes, when fleeing from Greece, left
                     all his equipment to Mardonius. And when Pausanias beheld the appointments of
                     Mardonius's tent, and his tent itself all furnished with gold and silver and
                     embroidered curtains, he ordered the bakers and confectioners to prepare him a
                     supper exactly as they had been in the habit of preparing for Mardonius. And
                     when they had done as they were commanded, Pausanias, beholding the couches of
                     gold and silver all ready laid and covered, and the silver tables, and the
                     superb banquet which was prepared, marvelling at what he saw, by way of
                     ridicule ordered his own slaves to prepare a banquet in the Lacedæmonian
                     fashion. But when it was made ready, Pausanias laughed, and sent for all the
                     generals of the Greeks; and when they were come he showed them both the
                     banquets which were prepared before him, and said: O Greeks, I have assembled
                     you, because I was desirous to exhibit to you the folly of the general of the
                     Medes; who, while he was used himself to live in the manner which you behold,
                     came against us who are in the habit of living in the hard way which you see

               <p>And some say that a citizen of Sybaris, who was staying at Sparta, and who dined
                  at their Phiditia, said—<quote>It is natural enough for the Lacedæmonians to be
                     the bravest of men; for any man in his senses would rather die ten thousand

               <p>Now the Copis is a peculiar sort of entertainment, just as that which is called
                  Aiclon. And when it tales place, first of all they erect tents near the temple of
                  the good; and in them they place beds of leaves; and on them they strew carpets,
                  and then they feast those who recline on them, not only those who arrive, being
                  natives of the country, but those foreigners also who are sojourning in the place.
                  And at these copides they sacrifice goats, but no other victim; and they give
                  portions of its flesh to every one, and they distribute also what they call a
                  physicillus, which is a little loaf like an encris, made of oil and honey, only
                  rounder in shape. And they give to every one who is present a newly made cheese,
                  and a slice of paunch, and black-pudding, and sweet-meats, and dried. figs, and
                  beans, and green kidney-beans. And any one of the rest of the Spartans who

                     the fountain called Tiassus, in the parts towards Cleta; and there they
                     celebrate copides, in a manner similar to those which have been already
                     mentioned. And they sacrifice small sucking-pigs, and they also at the feast
                     set before the guests some of the loaves called ipnitæ. But this aiclon is

                  books <pb n="v.1.p.226"/> which he has edited, for they amount to three thousand
                  and five hundred,) and said—"Polycrates, in his history of Lacedæmonian affairs,
                  relates that the Lacedæmonians celebrate the festival called Hyacinthia for three
                  days, and on account of their lamentation for Hyacinthus, they do not wear crowns
                  at their feasts, nor do they bring bread there, but they distribute cheesecakes,
                  and other things of the same kind. And they sing no paean to the god, nor do they
                  introduce anything of that sort, as they do in other sacred festivals, but they
                  eat their supper in a very orderly manner, and then depart. But on the middle one
                  of the three days there is a very superb spectacle, and a very considerable and
                  important assembly; for boys play upon the harp, girt up in their tunics, and
                  singing to the music of the flute, running over all the strings of the harp at the
                  same time with the plectrum, in an anapæstic rhythm, with a shrill tone, and in
                  that manner they sing a hymn in honour of the god. And others riding on horses and
                  handsomely dressed go through the theatre; and very numerous choruses of young men
                  enter, and they sing some of their native poems. And dancers mingled with them
                  perform an ancient sort of dance to the music of a flute and singing. And virgins
                  also, some in wooden curved chariots, called canathra, beautifully made, and
                  others in crowds of large waggons drawn by horses, make a procession; and the
                  whole city is in a state of agitation and of delight at the spectacle. And they
                  sacrifice great numbers of victims all this day. And the citizens give a banquet
                  to all their friends, and to their own slaves; and no one omits attending the
                  sacred feast, but the whole city is evacuated by the whole body of citizens
                  flocking to the spectacle.</p>

                  <quote>And the copis is also mentioned by Aristophanes or Philyllius in the

                     </quote> saying expressly that barley-cakes are set before the guests at the
                     copides, (for that is the meaning of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάρακες,</foreign> which does not mean cheesecakes, as Lycophron asserts,
                     nor barley-meal porridge, as Eratosthenes believes,) and loaves, and a
                     particular sort of broth very highly seasoned. More- over, what the copis is,
                     is very perspicuously explained by <pb n="v.1.p.227"/> Molpis in his treatise
                     on the Polity of the Lacedæmonians, where he writes, They also have feasts
                     which they call copides. But the copis is a supper consisting of barley-cakes,
                     loaves, meat, raw vegetables, soup, figs, sweetmeats, and warmed wine.
                     Moreover, sucking-pigs are not called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθαγορίσκοι,</foreign> as Polemo pronounces the word, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθραγορίσκοι,</foreign> since they are sold at early dawn
                        (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τὸν ὄρθρον</foreign>), as Persæus relates in his
                     treatise on the Lacedæmonian Polity. And Dioscorides, in the second book of his
                     Polity, and Aristocles, in the first book of the treatise which he also wrote
                     concerning the Lacedæmonian Polity, make the same statement. Besides, Polemo
                     says, that supper is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄϊκλον</foreign> by the
                     Lacedæmonians, and that all the rest of the Dorians give it the same name. For
                     Alcman says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     </quote> where he uses <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναίκλειαι</foreign> as
                     equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνδείπνια.</foreign> And in a subsequent
                     passage he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <l>Alcman prepared an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄϊκλον.</foreign>
                        </l>
                     </quote> But the Lacedæmonians do not call that portion which is given after
                     the supper <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄϊκλον,</foreign> nor that which is given
                     after supper at the phiditia; for that consists of bread and meat: but that is
                     called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπάϊκλον,</foreign> being, as it were, an addition
                     to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄϊκλον,</foreign> which is regularly appointed as
                     a part of the phiditia; and that is what I imagine the name implies. For the
                     preparation of what is called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπάϊκλα</foreign> is
                     not simple, as Polemo supposed, but of a two-fold nature. For that which they
                     give to the boys is very slight and trifling, being merely meal steeped in oil,
                     which Nicocles, the Lacedæmonian, says that they eat after supper, wrapped up
                     in leaves of the bay-tree, from which those leaves are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">καμματίδες,</foreign>
                     <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάπτω,</foreign> to swallow.</note> and the cakes themselves are called
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάμματα.</foreign> And that it was a custom of the
                     ancients to eat the leaves of the bay-tree at dessert, Callias or Diocles
                     asserts in the Cyclopes, speaking thus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <l>You will eat the leaves meant for supper,</l>

                     come on after supper. But he enjoins the poor to bring a reed, or a straw, or a
                     leaf of the bay-tree, in order that they may be able to eat the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπάϊκλα</foreign> after supper. For it consists of meal steeped
                     in oil; and this is wholly like the arrangement of some small state. For in
                     these <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπάϊκλα</foreign> they attend to all such points as
                     these: who ought to sit down first, or second, or who ought to sit down on a

                  concerning the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καμματίδες</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάμματα</foreign> Nicocles writes as follows:—<quote>But the

                     their contributions consist of what has been caught by them in hunting. Not but
                     what the rich contribute also bread and whatever vegetables or fruits may be in
                     season, in such quantities as are sufficient for one meal; thinking that to
                     provide more than is just enough is superfluous, as it will not be
                     eaten.</quote> And Molpis says—<quote>But after the supper is over something is
                     always contributed by some one or other, and sometimes by many joining
                     together; and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτύη,</foreign> which they call the
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπάϊκλον,</foreign> is prepared by them at their own
                     houses: but no one goes to any expense in buying what he contributes for this
                     purpose. For they do not contribute it for the purpose of giving pleasure, or
                     of indulging in any immoderate eating, but with the view of making a display of
                     their own skill in hunting. And many also who breed flocks of sheep, give their
                     produce very liberally. And this <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτύη</foreign>
                     consists of pigeons, geese, two hen-doves, thrushes, blackbirds, hares, lambs,
                     kids. And the cooks always proclaim the name of him who has contributed each
                     dish, in order that all men may see his devotion to hunting, and his eagerness
                     to contribute to their enjoyment.</quote>

               <p>Subsequently the Lacedæmonians relaxed the rigour of this way of living, and
                  became more luxurious. At all events, Phylarchus, in the fifteenth and again in
                  the twentieth book of his Histories, writes thus concerning them:—<quote>The
                     Lacedæmonians had given up assembling for the phiditia, according to the custom
                     of their country, and whenever they met, after having had a few things brought
                     round, for the sake of a seeing compliance with the law, other thins were then
                        <pb n="v.1.p.230"/> prepared; couches furnished in a very expensive way and
                     of exceeding size, and all differing from one another in their adornment; so
                     that some of the strangers who were invited used to be afraid to put their
                     elbows on the pillows; and those who formerly used to rest on a bare bench
                     during the whole banquet, perhaps once leaning on their elbows for a few
                     minutes, had now come to such a pitch of luxury as I have spoken of, and to a
                     serving up of many cups of wine, and of all sorts of food procured from all
                     countries and dressed in every kind of luxurious way; and besides that, they
                     had come to use foreign perfumes, and also foreign wines and sweetmeats. And
                     the people began this fashion who lived a short time before the reign of
                     Cleomenes, namely Areus and Acrotatus, rivalling the indulgences of the court
                     of Persia; and they in their turn were so far exceeded by some private
                     individuals, who lived in Sparta at that time, in their own personal
                     extravagance, that Areus and Acrotatus appeared people of such rigid economy as
                     to have surpassed the most simple of their predecessors in self-denial.</quote>

                  <quote>But Cleomenes was a man of eminent wisdom in his discernment of matters,
                     (although he was but a young man,) and also was exceedingly simple in his
                     manner of life. For he, being king, and having such important affairs intrusted
                     to his management, displayed such behaviour to any who were invited to any
                     sacrifice, as to make them see that what they had daily prepared at home for
                     themselves was in no respect inferior to what he allowed himself. And when many
                     embassies were sent to him he never made a banquet for the ambassadors at an
                     earlier hour than the regular time; and there never was anything more laid than
                     a common pentaclinum; and when there was no embassy, what was laid was a
                     triclinium. And there were no orders issued by the regulator of the feasts, as
                     to who should come in or who should sit down first: but the eldest led the way
                     to the couch, unless he himself invited any one else to do so; and he was
                     generally seen supping with his brother or with some of his friends of his own
                     age. And there was placed on a tripod a brazen wine-cooler, and a cask, and a
                     small silver cup holding two cotyle,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A
                        cotyla held about half a pint.</note> and a cyathus;<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A cyathus held about a twelfth part of a
                        pint.</note> and the spoon was <pb n="v.1.p.231"/> made of brass. And wine
                     was not brought round to drink unless any one asked for it; but one cyathus was
                     given to each guest before supper: and generally it was given to himself first;
                     and then, when he had thus given the signal, the rest also asked for some wine.
                     But what was served up was placed on a very common-looking table; and the
                     dishes were such that there was neither anything left, nor anything deficient,
                     but just a sufficient quantity for every one; so that those who were present
                     should not feel the want of anything. For he did not think it right to receive
                     guests as sparingly, in respect of soup and meat, as men are treated at the
                     phiditia; nor again, to have so much superfluity as to waste money for no
                     purpose, exceeding all moderation and reason in the feast; for the one extreme
                     he counted illiberal, and the other arrogant. And the wine was of rather a
                     better quality when he had any company. But while they were eating they all
                     kept silence; but a slave stood by, holding in his hand a vessel of mixed wine,
                     and poured out for every one who asked for it. And in the same manner, after
                     supper there was given to each guest not more than two cyathi of wine, and this
                     too was brought to each person as he made a sign for it. And there was no music
                     of any kind accompanying the meal, but Cleomenes himself conversed all the time
                     with each individual, having invited them, as it were, for the purpose of
                     listening and talking; so that all departed charmed with his hospitality and
                     affability.</quote>

                     of the taxes due to the city, which the chief magistrates of the city
                     distribute among each separate family. And each one of the slaves pays an
                     Aeginetan stater<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A stater was about

                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρεῖα.</foreign> And a woman has the superintendence
                     of their meals, having-three or four of the people under her to obey her
                     orders. Now each one of the company is followed by two servants bearing wood;
                     and their title is calophori. And there are in every town of Crete two houses
                     set apart for these <foreign xml:lang="grc">συσσίτιαι,</foreign> one of which
                     they call the men's house, and the other, that, namely, in which they receive
                     strangers, they call the sleeping house. And in the house which is set apart
                     for these public meals, there are first of all two tables set out, called the
                     strangers' tables, at which those foreigners who are present sit; and after
                     that tables are laid for the rest. And the younger men have half the quantity
                     of meat; and they touch none of the other dishes. Then a bowl of wine is placed
                     on each table, mingled with water; and all drink of this in common at the
                     common table; and when they have finished supper then another bowl is put on
                     the table. But for the boys one common bowl is likewise mixed; but the elders
                     have liberty to drink more if they feel inclined to. And the woman who has the
                     superintendence of the mess takes away from off the table, without any disguise
                     or concealment, the best of what is served up, and puts it before those who are
                     distinguished for warlike achievements or for wisdom. And when they have
                     finished supper, then, first of all, they are in the habit of deliberating on
                     the affairs of the state; and then, after that, they converse about exploits
                     which have been performed in war, and extol those who have behaved like valiant
                     men, and so exhort the younger men to acts of valour and virtue.</quote>

                     have dishes served up to them without any seasoning; and the youngest of them
                     minister to the others; and having uttered words of good omen they pour
                     libations to the gods, and distribute the dishes served up to all the guests.
                     They distribute some also to the sons who are sitting just behind the seat of
                     their <pb n="v.1.p.233"/> fathers; giving them one-half as much as is given to
                     men; but the orphans have an equal share. And whatever is served up to them has
                     no seasoning nor any luxurious mixtures compounded in it. There were also three
                     seats designed for strangers, and a third table, on the right hand side as you
                     went in to the house where the men ate; and that they called the table of the

               <p>And Herodotus, comparing the drinking parties of the Greeks with the banquets in
                  fashion among the Persians, says—<quote>But the Persians are accustomed to honour
                     that day above all others on which they were born. And on that day they think
                     it right to have a more splendid feast than on any other day. And on that day
                     those of them who are rich serve up an ox, and an ass, and a horse, and a
                     camel, all roasted whole in ovens: but those who are poor serve up only the
                     smaller animals, such as sheep; and they do not eat a great deal of meat, but
                     great quantities of sweetmeats, and no salt. And on this account the Persians
                     say that the Greeks, when they eat, leave off being still hungry, because after
                     supper nothing is served up to them worth speaking of. For that if anything
                     good were put before them they would not leave off eating it: but they sit very
                     long at their wine. And it is not allowed to them to vomit, nor to make water
                     in the presence of one another. And these laws are strictly observed among
                     them. And after they have drunk hard they are accustomed to deliberate on the
                     most important affairs. And whatever they determine on at these deliberations,
                     the next day the master of the house, wherever they were when they deliberated,
                     proposes to them over again when they are quite sober; and if they adopt the
                     same determination when sober, then they act upon it, but if not, they a
                     abandon it: and whatever they decide on when sober, they reconsider when they

               <p>But concerning the luxury of the kings among the Persians, Xenophon, in his

                     service of the king of Persia, looking to find out what may be pleasant for him
                     to drink; and ten thousand men are always contriving something nice for him to
                     eat; and no one can tell the number of contrivances they propose to cause him
                     to sleep well. <pb n="v.1.p.234"/> But Agesilaus, because he was a man fond of
                     exertion, drank whatever was set before him with pleasure, and ate whatever
                     came across him with appetite; and every place suited him to sleep pleasantly
                     in.</quote> And in his treatise entitled Hiero, speaking of the things which
                  are prepared for kings, and also of the dishes which are prepared for private
                  individuals to eat, he uses the following expressions:—<quote>' And I know,' said
                     he, ' O Simonides, that most men consider that we eat and drink more pleasantly
                     than private individuals in this respect, because they think that they should
                     more gladly eat of what is served up to us than of what is set before them. For
                     that whatever is out of the ordinary routine gives pleasure; on which account
                     all men gladly receive invitations to festivals, except kings. For as their
                     tables are always loaded to satiety, it is quite impossible that they should be
                     susceptible of any addition at the time of feasts; so that in this particular
                     pleasure which is derived from hope they are surpassed by private individuals.
                     And in the next place,' he continued, ' I am sure that you yourself know from
                     experience that the more any one sets before people that which is more than
                     sufficient, in that exact proportion is a disgust at eating quicker in coming
                     on; so that a man who has a very large and varied dinner set before him is
                     inferior to those who live moderately also in the duration of his pleasure.'
                     'But, by Jove,' said Simonides, as long as the mind feels an appetite, so long
                     are those who are bred up amid more expensive preparations delighted in a much
                     higher degree than those who are in the habit of living in a most economical

               <p>But Theophrastus, in the Book on Royal Authority, addressed to Cassander, (if
                  indeed the book under that title, attributed to him, be a genuine work of his, for
                  many say that it was written by Sosibius, to whom Callimachus the poet addresses a
                  triumphal hymn in elegiac metre,) says that <quote>the Persian kings were so
                     luxurious as to offer by proclamation a large sum of money to any one who could
                     invent any new pleasure.</quote> And Theopompus, in the thirty-fifth book of
                  his Histories, says, that <quote>the king of the Paphlagonians, whose name was
                     Thys, whenever he supped, ordered a hundred dishes of every sort to be placed
                     on his table, beginning with oxen. And that when he was led captive to the king
                     of Persia and kept in prison, he still continued to have the <pb n="v.1.p.235"/> same profusion served up to him, living in the most splendid manner. So that
                     Artaxerxes, when he heard of it, said that he appeared to him to be living like
                     a man who knew that he should soon die.</quote> But the same Theopompus, in the
                  fourteenth book of his History of the Exploits of Philip, says— <quote>When the
                     king comes to any one of his subject cities, twenty talents are expended on his
                     supper, and sometimes thirty; and some even spend a much larger sum still. For
                     it is a very old custom, that every city is bound to supply a supper in
                     proportion to its greatness, just on the same principle as its tribute to the
                     revenue and its taxes are exacted.</quote>

               <p>But Heraclides the Cumæan, who compiled a history of Persia, in the second book of
                  that work, which is entitled Preparatory, says—<quote>And those who wait upon the
                     Persian kings while they are at supper, all minister after having bathed,
                     wearing beautiful clothes; and they remain nearly half the day in attendance at
                     the feast. But of those who are invited to eat with the king, some dine
                     outside, and every one who chooses can see them, but some dine inside with the
                     king: and even these do not actually eat with him; but there are two rooms
                     opposite to one another, in one of which the king eats his meal, and in the
                     other the guests eat theirs. And the king beholds them through the curtain
                     which is at the door; but they cannot see him. But sometimes, when there is a
                     feast, then they all sup in one room, namely, in the same room as the king,
                     being the large room. And when the king has a drinking party, (and he has one
                     very often,) his guests are about a dozen in number, and when they have supped,
                     the king by himself, and his guests by themselves, then one of the eunuchs
                     summons those who are to drink, with the king: and when they come, then they
                     drink with him, but they do not have the same wine; also they sit on the ground
                     and he reclines on a couch with golden feet; and when they are very drunk
                     indeed they go away. But for the most part the king breakfasts and sups by
                     himself: but sometimes his wife sups with him; and sometimes some of his sons
                     do so. And at supper his concubines sing and play to him; and one of them
                     leads, and then all he rest sing in concert. But the supper,</quote> he
                  continues, <quote>which is called the king's supper, will appear to any one who
                     hears of it to be very magnificent; still, when it is examined into, it <pb n="v.1.p.236"/> will turn out to be economically and carefully managed, and
                     in the same manner as the meals of the other Persians who are in office. For
                     the king has a thousand victims slain every day: and among them are horses, and
                     camels, and oxen, and asses, and stags, and an immense number of sheep; and a
                     great many birds too are taken; and the Arabian ostrich (and that is a very
                     large animal), and geese, and cocks; and a moderate quantity of them is served
                     up to each of the mess-mates of the king, and each of them carries away what is
                     left for his breakfast. But the greater part of these victims and of this meat
                     is carried out into the court to the spear-bearers and light-armed troops whom
                     the king maintains; and in the court the masters of the feasts portion out the
                     meat and the bread into equal portions; and as the mercenary troops in Greece
                     receive money for their hire, so do these men receive food from the king, on
                     account, as if it were money. And in the same way, at the courts of the other
                     Persians, who hold office as magistrates, all the food is placed at once upon
                     the table; and when the mess-mates of the magistrate have finished their
                     supper, then he who superintends the meal distributes what is left on the table
                     (and the greater part of the bread and meat is left) to each of the servants.
                     And each attendant, when he has received his share, has his food for the day.
                     For the most honourable of the mess-mates (their title is <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ σύνδειπνοι</foreign>) never come to the king except to dinner; because,
                     forsooth, they have requested permission not to be bound to come twice in the
                     day, in order that they themselves may be able to receive guests at their own
                     houses.</quote>

               <p>But Herodotus, in his seventh book, says, that <quote>the Greeks, who received
                     Xerxes in hospitality, and invited him to supper, all came to the very
                     extremity of ruin, so as to be utterly turned out of their houses; as for
                     instance, among the Thasians, who, because of the cities which they had on the
                     continent, received the army of Xerxes and entertained it at supper. Antipater,
                     one of these citizens, expended four hundred talents in that single
                     entertainment; and he placed on the tables gold and silver cups and goblets;
                     and then the soldiers, when they departed after the supper, took them away with
                     them. And wherever Xerxes took two meals, dining as well as supping, that city
                     was utterly ruined.</quote>

                     year, on the day on which the king was born. And the name of this feast is in

               <p>But Alexander the Great, whenever he supped with any of his friends, as Ephippus
                  the Olynthian relates in his book on the Deaths of Alexander and Hephæstion,
                  expended each day a hundred minæ, as perhaps sixty or seventy of his friends
                  supped with him. But the king of the Persians, as Ctesias and Dinon relate in the
                  Histories of Persia, supped with fifteen thousand men, and there were expended on
                  the supper four hundred talents; and this amounts in Italian money to twenty four
                  hundred thousand of sesterces. And this sum when divided among fifteen thousand
                  men is a hundred and sixty sesterces of Italian money for each individual; so that
                  it comes to very nearly the same as the expense of Alexander; for he expended a

               <p>But Menander, in his play called Drunkenness, estimates the expense of the most
                  sumptuous banquet at a talent, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Then we do not in these matters act as we should do</l>
                     <l>When to the gods we sacrifice; for then we go and buy</l>
                     <l>A sheep, an offering for the gods, for scarce ten drachmas' price.</l>
                     <l>And then we send for flute players, and ointments, and perfumes,</l>
                     <l>And harps, and singing women, eels, and cheese, and honey too;</l>
                     <l>And ample jars of Thasian wine; but these can scarcely come,</l>
                     <l>When all together reckon'd up, to a small talent's sum.</l>
                  </quote> And it is as the very extravagance of expense that he has named a talent
                  at all. And in his Morose Man he speaks as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     him a royal entertainment, in which every dish was golden and inlaid with

                     had twelve triclinia laid; and invited Antony to a banquet, and desired him to
                     bring with him whatever companions he pleased. And he being astonished at the

                     her again the next day, and to bring his friends and captains with him. And
                     then she prepared a banquet by far more splendid than the former one, so as to
                     make that first one appear contemptible; and again she presented to him
                     everything that there was on the table; and she desired each of his captains to
                     take for his own the couch on which he lay, and the goblets which were set
                     before each couch. And when they were departing she gave to all those of the

                     she gave horses, adorned with golden furniture: and to every one she gave
                     Aethiopian boys, to bear torches before them. And on the fourth day she paid
                     more than a talent for roses; and the floor of the chamber for the men was
                     strewed a cubit deep, nets being spread over the blooms.</quote> And he relates

                     with green wood such as is seen in the caves sacred to Bacchus; and from this
                     scaffold he suspended drums and fawn-skins, and all the other toys which one
                     names in connexion with Bacchus, and then sat there with his friends, getting
                     drunk from daybreak,—a band of musicians, whom he had sent for from Italy,
                     playing t him all the time, and all the Greeks around being collected to see
                     the sight. And presently,</quote> continues he, <quote>he crossed over to the
                     Acropolis, the whole city of Athens being illuminated with lamps suspended from
                     the roof; and after that he ordered himself to be proclaimed as Bacchus

                  an enormous amount of riches. And I think that they would never have escaped, and
                  that there would have been no necessity for the Greeks being marshalled against
                  them at Platæa, as they would certainly have been killed by such food as that.</p>

               <p>But Hecatæus of Miletus, describing an Arcadian banquet in the third book of his
                  Genealogies, says that it consists chiefly of barley-cakes and pork. But Harmodius
                  of Lepreum, in the third book of his treatise on the Laws of the People of
                  Phigalea, says—<quote>The man among the Phigaleans who is appointed superintendent
                     of the food, brought every day three choes of wine, and a medimnus of flour,
                     and five mine weight of cheese, and other things suitable for the preparing of
                     the victims. And the city provided each of the choruses with three sheep, and a
                     cook, and a water-carrier, and tables, and seats for the guests to sit down
                     upon, and all other similar appointments; only that the choregus supplied the
                     vessels which the cook required. And the banquet was of the following
                     description: Cheese, and barley-cake, for the sake of' preserving the laws,
                     served up in brazen baskets, which are by some people called mazonoma, having
                     derived their name from the use to which they are put; and together with the
                     barley-cake and cheese, paunches and salt are given the guests to eat. And when
                     they have offered these things to the gods, then they give every one a portion
                     of wine to drink in a small mug, made of earthenware: and he <pb n="v.1.p.241"/> who brings the wine says, May you sup well. And the there is put on the
                     table for general use some soup and some minced meat; and every one has two
                     slices of meat put within his reach. And it was a custom of theirs at all their
                     banquets, and most especially at those which were called Mazones, or
                     barley-feasts, (for even now the feast in honour of acchus has this name,) to
                     give those of the young men who ate most manfully, a larger quantity of broth,
                     and also to set before them barley-cakes and loaves, for such an one was
                     considered a noble-minded and a valiant man for a large appetite was considered
                     an admirable and a famous thing among them. But after supper was over, they
                     used to make libations, without having washed their hands, but merely wiping
                     hem on pieces of bread; and each of them took away with him that on which he
                     had wiped his hands, doing this on account of the nightly objects of fear which
                     arise to frighten men in the cross roads: and after the libations a paean is
                     sung. But when they sacrifice to the Heroes, a very large sacrifice of oxen
                     takes place, and they all feast with the slaves; and the children sit at table
                     with their fathers, sitting naked on the stones.</quote>

                  them, and give what is left to their slaves. And on all the other days of the year
                  it is lawful for any one who pleases of those who are fed at the prytaneum to go
                  into the prytaneum to sup, having prepared at his own home some vegetable, or some
                  pulse, or some salt meat, or some fish, or a very little bit of pork; and when he
                  eats this, he may also have a cotyla of wine. But no woman is allowed to go into

                     the Egyptians was taken prisoner, Ochus treated him with great humanity, and
                     invited him to supper. And as there was a very splendid preparation made, the

                  that <quote>Ariamnes the Galatian, being an exceedingly rich man, gave notice that
                     he would give all the Galaians a banquet every year; and that he did so,
                     managing in this manner: He divided the country, measuring it by convenient
                     stages along the roads; and at these stages he erected tents of stakes and
                     rushes and osiers, each containing about four hundred men, or somewhat more,
                     according as the district required, and with reference to the number that might
                     be expected to throng in from the villages and towns adjacent to the stage in
                     question. And there he placed huge kettles, full of every sort of meat; and he
                     had the kettles made in the preceding year before he was to give the feast,
                     sending for artizans from other cities. And he caused many victims to be slain,
                     —numbers of oxen, and pigs, and sheep, and other animals,— every day; and he
                     caused casks of wine to be prepared, and a great quantity of ground corn. And

                     to be passing by were not allowed to escape by the slaves who stood around, but

               <p>Xenophon also mentions the Thracian suppers in the seventh book of his Anabasis,
                  describing the banquet given by Seuthes in the following words—<quote>But when
                     they all came to the supper, and the supper was laid so that they might all sit
                     round in a circle, then tripods were brought to all the guests; and they were
                     about twenty in number, all full of meat ready carved: and leavened loaves of
                     large size were tuck to the joints of meat with skewers. And most especially
                     were tables always placed before the guests, for that was the custom. And first
                     of all Seuthes behaved in this manner taking the loaves which were near him, he
                     broke them into small pieces, and threw the pieces to whoever he chose; and he
                     acted in the same way with the meat, leaving before himself only just as much
                     as he could eat; and the rest also did the same,—those <pb n="v.1.p.244"/> I
                     mean before whom the tables were set. But a certain Arcadian, Arystas by name,
                     a terrible fellow to eat, said that throwing the bread and meat about was
                     folly; and taking a large loaf in his hand, of the size of three chœnixes,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A chœnix held about a quart.</note> and
                     putting the meat upon his knees, made his supper in that manner. And they
                     brought round horns of wine, and all pledged one another; but Arystas, when the
                     cup-bearer came to him with the wine, said, as he saw that Xenophon was no
                     longer eating any supper, 'Give him the wine, for he has time to drink it, but
                     I have not time yet.' And then there arose laughter. And as the liquor went
                     round, a Thracian came in, having a white horse, and taking a horn full of
                     wine, said, ' O Seuthes, I pledge you, and I make you a present of my horse:
                     and if you ride him you will catch whatever you wish to catch; and when you
                     retreat you will never need to fear an enemy.' And another man brought in his
                     son, and gave him to him in the same manner, pledging him in wine: and another
                     gave him garments for his wife. And Timasion, pledging him, gave him a silver
                     goblet, and a scimitar worth ten minæ. But Gnesippus, an Athenian, rising up,
                     said that there was an ancient and excellent law, that those who had anything
                     should give it to the king as a compliment, and that the king should make
                     presents to those who had nothing. But Xenophon rose up boldly, and taking the
                     horn, said— 'I, O Seuthes, give you myself and these my companions to be
                     faithful friends to you; and not one of them is unwilling that I should do so:
                     and now they are present here asking for nothing, but being willing to
                     encounter labour and danger on your behalf.' And Seuthes, rising up, drank to
                     Xenophon, and spilt the rest of the contents of the horn at the same time that
                     he did. And after this there came in men who played on horns such as are used
                     for giving orders with, and also on trumpets made of raw bull's-hide, in
                     excellent tune, as if they had been playing on a magadis.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The magadis was a three-cornered

                     the ground: and their food consists of a few loaves, and a good deal of meat
                     brought up floating in water, and roasted on the coals or on spits. And they
                     eat their meat in a cleanly manner enough, but like lions, taking up whole
                     joints in both their hands, and gnawing them; and if there is any part which
                     they cannot easily tear away, they cut it off with a small sword which they
                     have in a sheath in a private depository. And those who live near the rivers
                     eat fish also, and so do those who live near the Mediterranean sea, or near the
                     Atlantic ocean; and they eat it roasted with salt and vinegar and cummin seed:
                     and cummin seed they also throw into their wine. But they use no oil, on
                     account of its scarcity; and because they are not used to it, it seems
                     disagreeable to them. But when many of them sup together, they all sit in a
                     circle; and the bravest sits in the middle, like the coryphæus of a chorus;
                     because he is superior to the rest either in his military skill, or in birth,
                     or in riches: and the man who gives the entertainment sits next to him; and
                     then on each side the rest of the guests sit in regular order, according as
                     each is eminent or distinguished for anything. And their armour-bearers,
                     bearing their large oblong shields, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυρεοὶ,</foreign> stand behind; and their spear-bearers sit down opposite
                     in a circle, and feast in the same manner as their masters. And those who act
                     as cup-bearers and bring round the wine, bring it round in jars made either of
                     earthenware or of silver, like ordinary casks in shape, and the name they give
                     them is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμβι???κος.</foreign> And their platters on which
                     they serve up the meat are also made of the same material; but some have brazen
                     platters, and some have wooden or plaited baskets. And the liquor which is
                     drunk is, among the rich, wine brought from Italy or from the country about
                     Marseilles; and this is drunk unmixed, but sometimes a little water is mixed
                     with it. But among the poorer classes what is drunk is a beer made of wheat
                     prepared with honey, ad oftener still without any honey; and they call it <hi rend="italics">corma.</hi> Ad they all drink it out of the same cup, in

                     running by the side of his chariot; and that he picked it up, and then went on
                     singing, saying that his very footprints upon the earth over which he drove
                     produced benefits to men.</quote> These now are the accounts of the Celtæ given

                     king reclines near on a lofty couch, eats whatever is thrown to him from the
                     king, like a dog. And very often he is torn away from his feast on the ground
                     for some trifling cause, and is scourged with rods and knotted whips; and when
                     he is all covered with blood he falls down on his face on the floor, and adores
                     the man who has punished him as his benefactor.</quote>

               <p>And in his eleventh book, speaking of Seleucus the king, and relating how he came
                  against Media, and warred against Arsaces, and was taken prisoner by the
                  barbarian, and how he remained a long time in captivity to Arsaces, being treated
                  like a king by him, he writes thus—<quote>Among the Parthians, at their banquets,
                     the king had a couch on which he reclined <pb n="v.1.p.247"/> by himself
                     higher than all the rest, and apart from them; and a table also was laid for
                     him by himself, as for a hero, laden with all sorts of barbaric
                     delicacies.</quote> And when he is speaking of Heracleon the Ber$oan, who was
                  promoted to honour by that king Antiochus who was surnamed Grypus, and who very
                  nearly turned his benefactor out of his kingdom, he writes as follows in the
                  fourth book of his Histories: <quote>He also gave entertainments to the soldiers,
                     making them sit down on the ground in the open air by thousands: and the
                     entertainment consisted of large loaves and meat; and their drink was any sort
                     of wine that could be got, mingled with cold water. And they were waited on by
                     men girded with swords, and there was an orderly silence throughout the whole

                     furnishes the entertainment, the whole preparation of the banquet is of a
                     Herculean character; for honey-wine is served out to the guests as wine, and
                     the food consists of huge loaves, and smoked meat boiled, and also great
                     abundance of roast meat from the victims which have been lately slain. But
                     among the Etruscans luxurious tables are spread twice a-day; and couches
                     embroidered with flowers, and silver drinking cups of every sort. And a great
                     number of well-appointed slaves is at hand, dressed in expensive

                  the Romans at their feasts practise single combats, writing as follows—<quote>The
                     Romans used to exhibit spectacles of single combats, not only in their public
                     shows and in their theatres, having derived the custom from the Etruscans, but
                     they did so also at their banquets. Accordingly, people often invited their
                     friends to an entertainment, promising them, in addition to other things, that
                     they should see two or three pairs of single combatants. And when they had had
                     enough of meat and drink, they then called in the combatants: and as soon as
                     one of them was killed, the guests clapped, being delighted at the exhibition.
                     And in one instance a man left it in his will that some beautiful women, whom
                     he had purchased as slaves, should engage in single combat: and in another case
                     a man desired that some youthful boys whom he had loved should do so; but the
                     people would not tolerate such notorious proceedings, and declared the will
                     invalid.</quote> And Eratosthenes says, in the first book of his Catalogue of
                  the Victors at Olympia, that the Etruscans used to box to the music of the
                  flute.</p>

               <p>But Posidonius, in the third, and also in the twentieth book of his Histories,
                     says—<quote>The Celtæ sometimes have single combats at their entertainments.
                     For being collected in arms, they go through the exercise, and make feints at,
                     and sometimes they even go so far as to wound one another. And being irritated
                     by this, if the bystanders do not stop them, they will proceed even to kill one
                     another. But in olden times,</quote> he continues, <quote>there was a custom
                     that a hind quarter of pork was put on the table, and the bravest man took it;
                     and if any one else laid claim to it, then the two rose up to fight till one of
                     them was slain. And other men in the theatre having received some silver or
                     gold money, and some even for a number of earthen vessels full of wine, having
                     taken pledges that the gifts promised shall really be given, and having
                     distributed them among their nearest connexions, have laid themselves down on
                     doors with their faces upwards, and then allowed some bystander to cut their

                     cut off with an axe, so that his heirs might receive the reward: and very often
                     many have returned their names as willing, so that there has been a regular

               <p>And Hermippus, in the first book of his treatise on Lawgivers, asserts that the
                  Mantineans were the original inventors of men to fight in single combat, and that
                  Demonax, one of their citizens, was the original suggestor of such a course; and
                  that the Cyreneans were the next to follow their example. And Ephorus, in the
                  sixth book of his History, says —"The Mantineans and Arcadians were in the habit
                  of practising warlike exercises; and even to this day they call the military dress
                  and the ancient fashion of arming the Mantinean, as having been invented by that
                  people. And in addition to this, the exercises of single combat were first
                  invented in Mantinea, Demeas being the original author of the invention. And that
                  the custom of single combatants was an ancient one, Aristophanes shows, when he
                  speaks thus in his Phœnisse— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  the antepenultima; but when it has the acute accent on the penultima, then the
                  verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάχεσθαι</foreign> comes in; as is shown in the words

                  Posidippus the comic writer, in his Pornoboscus, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  parts of this discussion. And Diyllus the Athenian says, in the ninth book <pb n="v.1.p.250"/> of his Histories, that Cassander, when returning from Bœotia,
                  after he had buried the king and queen at Aegæ, and with them Cynna the mother of
                  Eurydice, and had paid them all the other honours to which they were entitled,
                  celebrated also a show of single combats, and four of the soldiers entered the

               <p>But Demetrius the Scepsian, in the twelfth book of Trojan Array, says, <quote>that
                     at the court of Antiochus the king, who was surnamed the Great, not only did
                     the friends of the king dance in arms at his entertainments, but even the king
                     himself did so. And when the turn to dance came to Hegesianax the Alexandrian
                     from the Troas, who wrote the Histories, he rose up and said—' Do you wish, O
                     king, to see me dance badly, or would you prefer hearing me recite my own poems
                     very well?' Accordingly, being ordered rather to recite his poems, he sang the
                     praises of the king in such a manner, that he was thought worthy of payment,
                     and of being ranked as one of the king's friends for the time to come. But
                     Duris the Samian, in the seventeenth book of his Histories, says that
                     Polysperchon, though a very old man, danced whenever he was drunk,—a man who
                     was inferior to no one of the Macedonians, either as a commander or in respect
                     of his general reputation: but still that he put on a saffron robe and
                     Sicyonian sandals, and kept on dancing a long time.</quote> But Agatharchides
                  the Cnidian, in the eighth book of his History of Asia, relates that the friends
                  of Alexander the son of Philip once gave an entertainment to the king, and gilded
                  all the sweetmeats which were to be served up in the second course. And when they
                  wanted to eat any of them, they took off the gold and threw that away with all the
                  rest which was not good to eat, in order that their friends might be spectators of
                  their sumptuousness, and their servants might become masters of the gold. But they
                  forget that, as Duris also relates, Philip the father of Alexander, when he had a
                  golden cup which was fifty drachmas in weight, always took it to bed with him, and
                  always slept with it at his head. And Seleucus says, <quote>that some of the
                     Thracians at their drinking parties play the game of hanging; and fix a round
                     noose to some high place, exactly beneath which they place a stone which is
                     easily turned round when any one stands upon it; and then they cast lots, and
                     he who <pb n="v.1.p.251"/> draws the lot, holding a sickle in his hand, stands
                     upon the stone, and puts his neck into the halter; and then another person
                     comes and raises the stone, and the man who is suspended, when the stone moves
                     from under him, if he is not quick enough in cutting the rope with his sickle,
                     is killed; and the rest laugh, thinking his death good sport.</quote>

                  given by Cebes of Cyzicus. Therefore, having first taken a drink of hyssop, come
                  at the proper hour to the feast. For at the time when the festival of Bacchus was
                  being celebrated at Athens, I went to sup with him; and I found six Cynics sitting
                  at table, and one dogleader, Carneus the Megarian. But, as the supper was delayed,
                  a discussion arose, what water is the sweetest. And while some were praising the
                  water of Lerna, and some that of Pirene, Carneus, imitating Philoxenus, said—That
                  is the best water which is poured over our hands. So then when the tables were
                  laid we went to supper, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And much pulse porridge then we ate, but more did still flow in.</l>
                  </quote> Then again lentils were brought on the table steeped in vinegar; and that
                  child of Jupiter laid his hands on them and said— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Jove, may the man who made these lentils grow,</l>
                     <l>Never escape thy notice or thy memory.</l>
                  </quote> And then some one else immediately cried out— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>May a lentil deity and a lentil fate seize you.</l>
                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.1.p.253"/> But to me may there be, according to the words of the comic

                  </quote> And as a great laugh arose, immediately that spoon of the theatre Melissa
                  came in, and that dogfly Nicium, each of them being a courtesan of no small
                  renown: and so they, looking on what was set upon the table and admiring it,
                  laughed. And Nicium said,—Is not there one of all you men so proud of your beards
                  that eats fish? Is it because your ancestor Meleager the Gadarean, in his poem
                  entitled the Graces, said that Homer, being a Syrian by birth, represented the
                  ancients as abstaining from fish in accordance with the custom of his own country,
                  although there was a great abundance of them in the Hellespont? Or have you ever
                  read that one treatise of his which embraces a comparison between peas and
                  lentilsfor I see that you have made a great preparation of lentils. And when I see
                  it, I should advise you, according to the rules of Antisthenes the pupil of
                  Socrates, to relieve yourselves of life if you stick to such food as this. And
                  Carneus replied to her—Euxitheus the Pythagorean, O Nicium, as Clearchus the
                  Peripatetic tells us, in the second book of his Lives, said that the souls of all
                  men were bound in the body, and in the life which is on earth, for the sake of
                  punishment; and that God has issued an edict that if they do not remain there
                  until he voluntarily releases them himself, they shall fall into more numerous and
                  more important calamities. On which account all me, being afraid of those
                  threatenings of the gods, fear to depart from life by their own act, but only
                  gladly welcome death when he comes in old age, trusting that that deliverance of
                  the soul then takes place with the full consent of those who have the power to
                  sanction it. And this doctrine we ourselves believe. But I have no objection,
                  replied she, to your selecting one of three evils, if you please. For do you not
                  know, O retched men, that these heavy kinds of food shut in the dominant <pb n="v.1.p.254"/> principle of the soul, and do not allow wisdom to exist
                  unimpaired in it?</p>

                  walking in the depth of evening up and down before his house; and to those who
                  asked him what he was doing there, he used to reply that he was getting a relish
                  for supper. But we shall be satisfied with whatever portion we receive from you,
                  and we are not angry as if we received less than we ought, like the Hercules in
                  Anticlides. For he says, in the second book of his Returns—<quote>After Hercules
                     had accomplished his labours, when Eurystheus was solemnizing some sacrificial
                     feast, he also was invited. And when the sons of Eurystheus were setting before
                     each one of the company his proper portion, but placing a meaner one before
                     Hercules, Hercules, thinking that he was being treated with indignity, slew
                     three of the sons, Perimedes, Eurybius, and Eurypylus.</quote> But we are not
                  so irascible, even though in all other points we are imitators of Hercules.</p>

                  comic poet, who in the play entitled The Phœnician Women, is represented as
                  saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>When you boil lentils, pour no perfume o'er them.</l>
                  </quote> And Sopater, too, whom you were mentioning just now, in his Descent to
                  Hell, speaks in these terms:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>On lentils thrown: courage, my noble soul!</l>
                  </quote> And Clearchus the Peripatetic philosopher, in his treatise on Proverbs,
                  gives the saying, <quote>Perfume thrown on lentils;</quote> as a proverb which my
                  grandfather Varro also mentions, he, I mean, who was nicknamed Menippius. And many
                  of the Roman grammarians, who have not had much intercourse with many Greek poets
                  or historians, do not know where it is that Varro got his Iambic from. But you
                  seem to me, O Cynulcus, (for you delight in that name, not using the name by which
                  your mother has called you from your birth,) according to your friend Timon, to be
                  a noble and great man, not knowing that the lentil soup obtained mention from the
                  the former Epicharmus, in his Festival, and in his Islands, and also from
                  Antiphanes the comic poet; who, using the diminutive form, has spoken of it in his
                  Wedding, under the following form of expression— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And Magnus immediately taking up the conversation, said,— The most
                  universally excellent Laurentius has well and cleverly met this hungry dog on the
                  subject of the lentil soup. But I, like to the Galatians of the Paphian Sopater,
                  among whom it is a custom whenever they have met with any eminent success in war

                  of that beautiful <pb n="v.1.p.261"/> philosopher Persæus, compiled out of the
                  Commentaries of Stilpon and Zeno, in which he inquires, How one may guard against
                  guests at a banquet going to sleep; and, How one ought to use drinking of healths;
                  and, When one ought to introduce beautiful boys and girls into a banquet; and when
                  one ought to treat them well as if they were admired, and when one ought to send
                  them away as disregarding them; and also, concerning various kinds of cookery, and
                  concerning loaves, and other things; and all the over-subtle discussions in which
                  the son of Sophroniscus has indulged concerning kissing. A philosopher who was
                  continually exercising his intellect on such investigations as these, being
                  entrusted, as Hermippus relates, with the citadel of Corinth by Antigonus, got
                  drunk and lost even Corinth itself, being outwitted and defeated by Aratus the
                  Sicyonian; who formerly had argued in his Dialogues against Zeno the philosopher,
                  contending that a wise man would in every respect be a good general; and this
                  excellent pupil of Zeno proved this especial point admirably by his own
                  achievements. For it was a witty saying of Bion the Borysthenite, when he saw a
                  brazen statue of his, on which was the inscription, PERSEUS OF CITIUM, THE PUPIL
                  OF ZENO, that the man who engraved the inscription had made a blunder, for that it
                  ought to have been, Persæus the servant (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκιτίεα</foreign>

                  of Zeno, as Nicias of Nicæa relates, in his History of Philosophers; and this is
                  confirmed by Sotion the Alexandrian, in his Successions. And I have met with two

                  messenger to him, desiring him who carried the message to seek out a disciple of
                  Pythagoras who kept the portico crowded by his insane vagaries about dress, and
                  his insolence. And Sosicrates, in the third book of the Succession of
                  Philosophers, relates that Diodorus used to wear a long beard, and a worn-out
                  cloak, and to keep his hair long, indulging in these fashions out of a vain
                  ostentation. For that the Pythagoreans before him wore very handsome clothes, and
                  used baths, and perfumes, and hair of the ordinary length.</p>

               <p>And if you in reality, O philosopher, do admire contentment and moderation in your

                  instruments? or in order to spout some verses of Cepholion the Athenian? For

                  And all this is plain from what Alexis relates in this book which is entitled
                  Linus: and in that he supposes Hercules to have been educated by Linus, and to
                  have been ordered by him to select any one out of a number of books that were at
                  hand to read. And he having taken a cookery-book in his hand, retained it with
                  great eagerness. And Linus then speaks to him in the following terms— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     the revenues of the Athenian people. But Callistratus,</quote> he continues,

                     sacrifices oxen nearly every month, and celebrates public festivals; and the
                     chief body of private individuals is always occupied in banquets and drinking
                     parties. And the Tarentines hold some such language as this: That other men,
                     because they are fond of personal exertion, and because they devote themselves
                     to actual labour, prepare their subsistence in this way for the future: but

                     properly, or of managing his household with moderation. And of that he himself
                     was the cause, being a most insatiable and extravagant man, doing everything in
                     an offhand manner, whether he was acquiring property or giving it away. For
                     though he was a soldier, he was unable, out of pure laziness, to count what he
                     had coming in and what he spent. And then his companions were men collected
                     together <pb n="v.1.p.268"/> from all quarters; for some of them came from his
                     own country, and some from Thessaly, and some from other parts of Greece, not
                     being selected with any care; but if among either Greeks or barbarians there
                     was any lascivious, or im- pure, or avaricious man, he had almost every one of
                     the same character assembled in Macedonia, and they were all called friends of
                     Philip. And even if any one came who was not entirely of that disposition,
                     still under the influence of the life and manners of the Macedonians, he very
                     soon became like the rest. For their wars, and military expeditions, and other
                     great expenses, encouraged them to be audacious, and to live, not in an orderly
                     manner, but after a prodigal fashion and like robbers.</quote>

                     gave him many presents, and among them he gave him the fortified place which he
                     asked for. And that very place Pasicyprus the king had previously sold, in a
                     luxurious freak, for fifty talents, to Pymatus the Cittiæan, selling him both
                     the fortress itself and his own royal authority over it. And when he had
                     received the money he grew old in Amathus.</quote> Such also was Aethiops the
                  Corinthian, as Demetrius the Scepsian relates, of whom mention is made by
                  Archilochus; <quote>for he, out of his love of pleasure and intemperance, sailing
                     with Archias to Sicily when he was about to found Syracuse, sold to his
                     messmate for a cake of honey the lot which he had just drawn, and was about to

                  had Aristagora the Corinthian for a mistress, and lived in a most expensive
                  manner. And when the Areopagitæ summoned him before them, and ordered him to live
                  more decorously— <quote>But even now,</quote> said he, <quote>I live like a
                     gentleman, for I have a most beautiful mistress, and I do no wrong to any one,
                     and I drink Chian wine, and I have a sufficiency of everything, as my own
                     revenues suffice for all these expenses. And I do not live as some of you do,

                  by name. And Antigonus the king, having heard this, made him a thesmothete. And
                  he, being an hipparch at the Panathenæa, erected a seat close to the statues of
                  Mercury for Aristagora, higher than the Mercuries themselves. And when the
                  mysteries were celebrated at Eleusis, he placed a seat for her close to the
                  temple, saying that those who endeavored to hinder him should repent it.</p>

                  extravagant men, and those who had no ostensible means of living: and many others
                  have told the same story. At all events, those judges sent for Menedemus and
                  Asclepiades the philosophers when they were young men and poor, and asked them how
                  they managed to look so sleek and comfortable when they spent the whole day idling
                  with philosophers, and had no property. And they replied that some one of the men
                  about the mill had better be sent for. And when he came and said that they came
                  every night to the mill and threshed and ground the corn, and each earned two
                  drachmæ, the judges of the Areopagus marvelled, and presented them with two
                  hundred drachmæ as a reward.</p>
               <p>And the citizens of Abdera brought Democritus to trial, on the ground that he had

                  beyond all other men in intemperance. This is that Apicius who was the cause of
                  banishment to Rutilius, who wrote the history of the Romans in the Greek language.

                     there was not one Athenian who did not hate him. And whenever any one met him
                     they said to him, 'O you man who are a disgrace to your family!' For he had
                     expended all his patrimony on intemperance; and after this he became a
                     flatterer of the prefect of Munychia; on which account he was again attacked
                     and reproached by every one. And once, when a voluntary contribution was being
                     made, he came forward and said, before the whole assembly, ' I, too, contribute
                     my share.' And the Athenians all with one accord cried out, 'Yes, to
                     profligacy.' And Phocus was a man very fond of drinking hard; and accordingly,
                     when he had conquered with horses at the Panathenæa, and when Sopater
                     entertained his companions at a banquet, the preparation was very splendid, and
                     foot-tubs full of wine and spices were set before all who came in. And his
                     father, seeing this, called Phocus, and said, 'Will you not stop your companion

               <p>But I am not ignorant of what Apollodorus the Athenian has said of the Delians,
                  that they supplied all who came to their sacred ceremonies with the assistance of
                  cooks and table-setters; and from their actions they were named Magis and
                  Gongylis;—since, says Aristophanes, they furnished them at these banquets with
                  round barley-cakes, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γόγγυλαι μάζαι,</foreign>) as if they
                  had been women. And even to this very day some of them are called Chœraci, and

                  Neocori, and Icthyboli. And of the women, some are called Cuminanthæ. But all are
                  called by one common name Eleodytæ, because they attend on the kitchen tables, and
                  minister at the festivals. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλεος</foreign> means a
                  kitchen or cook's table. Homer says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  his action <quote>against the whole body of the Eleodytæ.</quote> And the law of
                  the Amphictyons commands the Eleodytæ to provide water; meaning by Eleodytæ the
                  table-setters, and all attendants of that sort. But Criton the comic poet, in his
                  Busy-body, calls the Delians the parasites of the god, in these lines— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But Achæus the Eretrian, in his Alcmæon, a satyric drama, calls the Delphians
                  makers of sauces, in these words:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I see the sauce-makers, and spit on them.</l>
                  </quote> Inasmuch, forsooth, as they cut up the victims, it is plain that they
                  cooked and seasoned them; and, having a regard to these facts, Aristophanes also
                  said— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But O thou Phœbus, thou who sharpenest</l>
                     <l>The Delphian knives, and with an early warning</l>
                     <l>Givest instruction to thy ministers.</l>
                  </quote> And, in the lines immediately following the former passage, Achæus says—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Why do you stay conceal'd,</l>
                     <l>Namesake of all the knives which cooks employ</l>
                  </quote> For the Satyrs ridicule the Delphians, as devoting all their time and
                  attention to festivals and sacrifices. And Semus says, in the fourth book of his
                  Deliad, <quote>The Delians used to provide the Delphians who came to Delos with
                     salt, ad vinegar, and oil, and wood, and counterpanes.</quote> And Arisotle, or
                     <pb n="v.1.p.278"/> Theophrastus, in his Commentaries, speaking of the Magne-
                  sians who dwell on the banks of the river Mæander, as colonists of the Delphians,
                  represents them as showing the same attentions to all foreigners who came to them;
                  speaking as follows: —<quote>The Magnesians who dwell on the banks of the river
                     Mæander, being sacred to the god, and colonists of the Delphians, give shelter
                     to all who come among them, and salt, and oil, and vinegar, and lights, and
                     beds, and coverlets, and tables.</quote> But Demetrius the Scepsian, in the
                  sixteenth book of his Trojan Array, says that in Laconia, on the road which is
                  called the Hyacinthine road, statues of the heroes Daiton and Ceraon were erected
                  by those who made barley-cakes at the Phiditia, and by the attendants who mixed
                  the wine. And the same writer reports also, in the twenty-fourth book of the same
                  work, that Daitas the hero is worshipped among the Trojans, who is also mentioned
                  by Mimnermus. And Hegesander the Delphian says that Jupiter is worshipped in
                  Cyprus, under the names of Eilapinastes or the Feaster, and of Splanchnotomus or
                  the Carver of Entrails.</p>

               <p>And while much such conversation as this was proceed- ing, on a sudden a noise was
                  heard from some one of the neighbouring places, as from an hydraulic organ, very
                  pleasant and agreeable, so that we all turned round towards it, being charmed by
                  the melody; and Ulpian looking towards the musical Alcides said, Do you hear, O
                  you most musical of men, this beautiful harmony which has made us turn round,
                  being enchanted by the music? And is it not the case, as it is said to be among
                  you Alexandrians, that constant music of an unaccompanied flute causes pain rather
                  than any musical pleasure to those who hear it? And Alcides said,—But this engine,
                  the hydraulic organ, whether you choose to class it among stringed instruments or
                  among wind instruments, is the invention of a fellow-countryman of ours, an
                  Alexandrian, a barber by trade; and his name is Ctesibius. And Aristocles reports
                  this, in his book on Choruses, saying— <quote>The question is asked, whether the
                     hydraulic organ is a stringed instrument or a wind instrument.</quote> Now
                  Aristoxenus did not feel sure on this point; but it is said, that Plato showed a
                  sort of notion of the invention, making a nightly clock like the hydraulic organ;
                  being very like an enormous hour-glass. And, indeed, the hydraulic organ does seem
                  to be <pb n="v.1.p.279"/> a kind of hour-glass. It cannot, therefore, be
                  considered a stringed instrument, and one to be played by touching. But perhaps it
                  may be called a wind instrument, because the organ is inflated by the water; for
                  the pipes are plunged down into the water, and when the water is agitated by a
                  youth, as the axles penetrate through the whole organ, the pipes are inflated, and
                  emit a gentle and agreeable sound. And this organ is like a round altar; and they
                  say that it was invented by Ctesibius the barber, who dwelt at that time in the
                  territory of Aspendor, in the reign of the second Ptolemy surnamed Euergetes; and
                  they say that he was a very eminent man; they say also, that he learnt a good deal
                  from his wife Thais. But Trypho, in the third book of his treatise on Names, (and
                  it is a dissertation on Flutes and Organs,) says Ctesibius the mechanic wrote a
                  book about the hydraulis; but I am not sure that he is not mistaken as to the
                  name. At all events, Aristoxenus prefers stringed instruments which are played
                  upon by the touch to wind instruments; saying that wind instruments are very easy;
                  for that many people, without having been taught, can play on the flute and pipe,
                  as for instance, shepherds.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="76">
               <p>And this is what I have got to say to you about the hydraulic organ, O Ulpian. For
                  the Phoenicians used a kind of flute called the gingras, according to the account
                  of Xenophon, about a span in length, and of a very shrill and mournful tone. And
                  the same instrument is used also by the Carians in their wailings, unless, indeed,
                  when he says Phœnicia he means Caria; and indeed you may find the name used so in
                  Corinna and in Bacchylides. And these flutes are called gingri by the Phœnicians
                  from the lamentations for Adonis; for you Phoenicians called Adonis Gingres, as
                  Democlides tells us. And Antiphanes mentions the gingri flutes, in his Physician;
                  and Menander does so too, in his Carina; and Amphis, in his Dithyrambus, saying—

               <p>But how much better, O most sagacious Ulpian, is this hydraulic organ, than the

               <p>For Juba, in the before-mentioned treatise, says that the Egyptians call the

                  which is called photinx, and that, too, I will presently show you is mentioned by
                  a very illustrious author; for the photinx is the same as the flute, which is a

                  Assemblies in Honour of Daphne, says, "He touched every kind of instrument, one
                  after another, castanets, the weak-sounding pandurus, but he drew the sweetest
                  harmony from the sweet monaulos. And Posidonius the Stoic philosopher, in the
                  third book of his Histories, speaking of the war of the Apameans against the
                  Larisæans, writes as follows—<quote>Having taken short daggers sticking in their
                     waists, and small lances covered with rust and dirt, and having put veils and
                     curtains over their heads which produce a shade but do not hinder the wind from
                     getting to their necks, dragging on asses laden with wine and every sort of
                     meat, by the side of which were packed little photinges and little monauli,
                     instruments of revelry, not of war.</quote> But I am not ignorant that Amerias
                  the Macedonian, in his Dialects, says, that the monaulos is called tityrinus. So
                  here you have, O excellent Ulpian, a man who mentions the photinx. But that the
                  monaulos was the same instrument which is now called calamaules, or reedfife, is
                  clearly shown by Hedylus, in his Epigrams, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But I wish you to know, my most excellent Ulpian, that a more musical and
                  accomplished people than the Alexandrians is not mentioned. And I do not speak
                  only of playing on the harp, with which even the poorest people among us, and
                  those who do not make a profession of it, and who are utterly ignorant of every
                  other kind of learning, are so familiarized that they can in a moment detect any
                  error which has been made in striking the strings,—but especially are they skilful
                  with the flute; and not only in those which are called girls' flutes and boys'
                  flutes, but also in men's flutes, which are called perfect and superperfect; and
                  also in those which are called harp-flutes and finger-flutes. For the flutes
                  called elymi, which Sophocles mentions in his Niobe and in his Drummers, we do not
                  understand to be anything but the common Phrygian flute. And these, too, the
                  Alexandrians are very skilful in. They are acquainted also with the flute with two
                  holes, and also with the intermediate flute, and with those which are called
                  hypotreti, or bored underneath. And Callias also speaks of the flute called elymi,
                  in his Pedetæ. But Juba says that they are an invention of the Phrygians, and that
                  they were also called scytaliæ, from their resemblance in thickness to the
                  scytale. And Cratinus the younger says that the Cyprians also use them, in his
                  Thera- menes. We know, too, of some which are called half-bored, of which Anacreon
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>What lust has now seized thus upon your mind,</l>

                  </quote> And these flutes are smaller than the perfect flutes. At all events,

                  flute; all which are mentioned by Ephorus, in his Inventions and by Euphranor the
                  Pythagorean, in his treatise on Flutes, and also by Alexon, who wrote another
                  treatise on Flutes. But the flute made of reeds is called tityrinus among the
                  Dorians in Italy, as Artemidorus the Aristophanian tells us, in the second book of
                  his History of Doris. And the flute which is called magadis, which is also named
                  palæo-magais, sends forth a sharp and a deep note at the same time, as
                  Anaxandrides says in his Armed Fighter— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I will speak like a magadis, both loudly and gently</l>
                  </quote> And the flutes called lotus flutes are the same which are called
                  photinges by the Alexandrians; and they are made of the plant called the lotus;
                  and this is a wood which grows in Libya. But Juba says that the flute which is ma
                  e out of the leg bones of the kid is an invention of the Thebans; and Tryphon says
                  that those flutes also which are called elphantine flutes were first bored among
                  the Phoenicians. I know, too, that the magadis is a stringed instrument, as is the
                  harp, the lyre, and the barbitos. But Euphorion the epic poet says in his book on
                  the Isthmian Games—<quote>Those men who are now called players on the nablas, and
                     on the pandurus, and on the sambuca, do not use any new instrument, for the
                     baromus and the barbitos (both of which are mentioned by Sappho and Anacreon),
                     and the magadis, and the triangle, and the sambuca are all ancient instruments.
                     At all events, a statue of one of the Muses was erected in Mitylee by
                     Lesbothemis, holding a sambuca in her hand.</quote> But Aristoxenus calls the
                  following foreign instruments—phœnices, and pectides, and magadides, and sambucæ,
                  and triagles, and clepsiambi, and scindapsi, and the instrument called the
                  enneachord or nine-stringed instrument. But Plato, in the third book of his
                  Polity, states—<quote>' We shall not, hen,' said I, 'have much need of many
                     strings or of much harmony in our songs and melodies.' 'I think not,' said he.

               <p>But the scindapsus is an instrument of four strings, as Matron the parodist says

                  </quote> The instrument called pariambis is mentioned by Epicharmus, in his
                  Periallus, in this way— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But Semele doth dance and he doth sing</l>

                     <l>And she rejoices at the rapid song.</l>
                  </quote> Now it was Alexander of Cythera, according to the account given by Juba,
                  who completed the psaltery with its full number of strings. And he, when he had
                  grown old in the city of the Ephesians, suspended this instrument in the temple of
                  Diana, as being the most skilful invention he had made with reference to his art.
                  Juba mentions also the lyrophœnix and the Epigonius, which, though now it is
                  transformed into the upright psaltery, still preserves the name of the man who was
                  the first to use it. But Epigonius was by birth an Ambraciot, but he was
                  subsequently made a citizen of Sicyon. And he was a man of great skill in music,
                  so that he played the lyre with his bare hand without a plectrum. For the

                  Romans so music-mad that even now most people recollect the way in which he used
                  to play. And Sophocles speaks of this triangle in his Mysians, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  the Assemblies in honour of Daphne. But Pythagoras, who wrote a book on the Red

                  Euphorion the epic poet, in his treatise on the Modulation of Songs, says that
                  Mercury invented the pipe which consists of one single reed; but that some say
                  that Seuthes and Ronaces the Medes did so; and that Sileuus invented the pipe
                  which is made of many reeds, and that Marsyas invented that one which is joined

               <p>This then, O my word-hunting Ulpian, is what you may learn from us Alexandrians,
                  who are very fond of the music of the monaulos. For you do not know that Menecles
                  the Barcæman compiler, and also that Andron, in his Chronicles, him of Alexandria
                  I mean, assert that it is the Alexandrians who instructed all the Greeks and the
                  barbarians, when the former encyclic mode of education began to fail, on account
                  of the incessant commotions which took place in the times of the successors of
                  Alexander. There was subsequently a generation of all sorts of learning in the
                  time of Ptolemy the seventh king of Egypt, the one who was properly called by the
                  Alex- <pb n="v.1.p.286"/> andrians Cacergetes; for he having murdered many of the
                  Alexandrians, and banished no small number of those who had grown up to manhood
                  with his brother, filled all the islands and cities with men learned in grammar,
                  and philosophy, and geometry, with musicians, and painters, and schoolmasters, and
                  physicians, and men of all kinds of trades and professions; who, being driven by
                  poverty to teach what they knew, produced a great number of celebrated pupils.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="84">
               <p>But music was a favourite amusement of all the Greeks of old time; on which
                  account also skill in playing the flute was much aimed at. Accordingly, Chamæleon
                  of Heraclia, in his book entitled Protrepticus, says that the Lacedæmonians and
                  Thebans all learned to play on the flute, and the inhabitants of Heraclea in
                  Pontus devoted themselves to the same study down to his own time. And that so did
                  the most illustrious of the Athenians, Callias the son of Hipponicus, and Critias
                  the son of Callaeschrus. But Duris, in his treatise on Euripides and Sophocles,
                  says that Alcibiades learnt music, not of any ordinary master, but of Pronomus,
                  who had the very highest reputation in that line. And Aristoxenus says that
                  Epaminondas the Theban learnt to play the flute of Olympiodorus and Orthagoras.
                  And likewise, many of the Pythagoreans practised the art of flute-playing, as
                  Euphranor, and Archytas, and Philolaus, and many others. But Euphranor has also
                  left behind an essay on Flutes, and so too has Archytas. And Aristophanes shows
                  us, in his Daitaleis, the great eagerness with which men applied themselves to
                  this study, when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I who am wasted quite away</l>
                     <l>In the study of flutes and harps,</l>
                     <l>Am I now to be sent to dig?</l>
                  </quote> And Phrynichus, in his Ephialtes, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But were not you the man who taught him once</l>
                     <l>To play upon the flute and well-strung harp?</l>
                  </quote> And Epicharmus, in his Muses, says that Minerva played a martial strain
                  to the Dioscuri. And Ion, in his Phœnician, or Cæneus, calls the flute a cock,
                  speaking thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The cock then sang the Greeks a Lydian hymn.</l>
                  </quote> And also, in his Garrison, he calls the pipe the Idæan cock, using the
                  following expression:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The pipe, th' Idæan cock, precedes your steps.</l>
                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.1.p.287"/> And, in the Second Phœnix, the same Ion writes— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I made a noise, bringing the deep-toned flute</l>
                     <l>With fluent rhythm.</l>
                  </quote> Where he means Phrygian rhythm; and he calls the Phrygian flute
                  deep-toned. For it is deep; on which account they also add a horn to it, having a
                  similarity to the bell mouth of trumpets.</p>

               <p>BUT since, O Timocrates, we have now had a great deal of conversation on the
                  subject of banquets in all that has been hitherto said; and since we have passed
                  over those things in them which are most useful and which do not weigh down the

                  incidentally teaches us, I will also mention what has been said concerning these

                  </quote> The poet accordingly says, when he is speaking of Menelaus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  marriage; and also, the king of Lycia instructs us what sort of banquet ought to

               <p>For wine appears to have a very attractive influence in promoting friendship, as
                  it warms and also melts the soul. On <pb n="v.1.p.288"/> which account the
                  ancients did not ask who a man was before drinking, but afterwards; as honouring
                  the laws of hospitality itself, and not this or that particular individual. But
                  the lawgivers, taking care beforehand of the banquets of the present day, have
                  appointed feasts for the tribe, and feasts for the borough; and also general
                  banquets, and entertainments to the ward, and others also called orgeonica. And
                  there are many meetings of philosophers in the city, some called the pupils of
                  Diogenes, and others, pupils of Antipater, others again styled disciples of
                  Panætius. And Theophrastus bequeathed money for an entertainment of that sort.
                  Not, by Jove, in order that the philosophers assembled might indulge in
                  intemperance, but in order that during the banquet they might have a wise and
                  learned conversation. And the Prytanes were accustomed every day to meet in
                  well-regulated banquets, which tended to the advantage of the state. And it was to
                  such a banquet as that Demosthenes says the news of the taking of Elatea was
                  brought. <quote>For it was evening, and a man came bringing news to the Prytanes
                     that Elatea was taken.</quote> And the philosophers used to be careful to
                  collect the young men, and to feast with them according to some well-considered
                  and carefully laid down law. Accordingly, there were some laws for banquets laid
                  down by Xenocrates, in the Academy, and again by Aristotle.</p>
               <p>But the Phiditia in Sparta, and the Andrea, or man's feasts, among the Cretans,
                  were celebrated in their respective cities with all imaginable care. On which
                  account some one said not unwisely— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Dear friends should never long abstain from feasts,</l>
                     <l>For e'en the memory of them is delightful.</l>
                  </quote> And Antipater the philosopher once assembled a banqueting party, and
                  invited all the guests on the understanding that they were to discuss subtle
                  questions. And they say that Arcesilaus, being once invited to a banquet, and
                  sitting next to a man who ate voraciously, while he himself was unable to enjoy
                  anything, when some one of those who were present offered him something, said—

                  Zeno, when some epicure who was at the same party with him snatched away the upper

                  turned the fish round himself, and took the remaining portion, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And Socrates seeing a man once devouring dainties eagerly, Said—O you
                  bystanders, which of you eats bread as if it were sweetmeats, and sweetmeats as if

            <div type="chapter" n="3">
               <p>But now let us speak of the banquets celebrated by Homer. For the poet gives us
                  the different times of them, and the persons present, and the causes of them. And
                  Xenophon and Plato have done well to imitate him in this; who at the very
                  beginning of their treatises set forth the cause which gave rise to the banquet,
                  and mention the names of those who were present. But Epicurus never defines either
                  the place or the time, nor does he preface his accounts with any preliminary
                  statement. But Aristotle says that it is an unseemly thing for a man to come
                  unwashed and covered with dust to a banquet. Then Homer instructs us who ought to
                  be invited; saying that one ought to invite the chiefs, and men of high
                  reputation— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     </l>
                  </quote> not acting on the principle asserted by Hesiod, for he bids men invite
                  chiefly their neighbours— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Then bid your neighbours to the well-spread feast,</l>

                     </l>
                  </quote> For such a banquet would be one of rustic stupidity; and adapted to the
                  most misanthropic of proverbs— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Friends who far off do live are never friends.</l>
                  </quote> For how can it be anything but nonsense that friendship should depend on
                  place and not on disposition? Therefore we find in Homer, that after the cup had
                  gone round, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Then the old man his counsels first disclosed;<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Iliad, viii. 324.</note>
                     </l>
                  </quote> but among people who did not regulate their banquets in an orderly manner
                  we read— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Then first the flatterer rose with mocking speech.</l>
                  </quote> Besides, Homer introduces guests differing in ages and tastes, such as
                  Nestor, Ulysses, and Ajax, who are all invited together. And speaking in general
                  terms he represents all who lay claim to any sort of eminence as invited, and
                  individually those who arrive at it by different roads. But Epicuus has
                  represented all his guests as believers in the atonic theory, <pb n="v.1.p.290"/>
                  and this, too, though he had models both in the variety of the banquets of the
                  great poet, and also in the elegant accounts of Plato and Xenophon; of whom Plato
                  has introduced Eryximachus the physician, and Aristophanes the poet, and other
                  professors of different branches of science, discussing matters of weight: and
                  Xenophon has mingled with them some private individuals.</p>
               <p>Homer therefore has done much the best of all, and has given us by far the best
                  banquets; and that again is best seen by comparing him with others. For the
                  banquet of the suitors in Homer is just such as might be expected from young men
                  devoted to drinking and love; and that of the Phæacians is more orderly, but still
                  luxurious. And he has made a wide distinction between these entertainments and
                  those which may be called military banquets, and those which have reference to
                  political affairs and are conducted in a well-regulated manner: and again he has
                  distinguished between public and family banquets. But Epicurus has described a
                  banquet consisting of philosophers alone.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="4">
               <p>Homer, too, has pointed out whom one ought not to invite, but who ought to
                  consider that they have a right to come uninvited, showing by the presence of one
                  of the relations that those in similar circumstances had a right to be present—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Unbidden there the brave Atrides came.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Iliad, ii. 408.</note>
                     </l>
                  </quote> For it is plain that one ought not to send a formal invitation to one's
                  brother, or to one's parents, or to one's wife, or to any one else whom one can
                  possibly regard in the same light as these relations, for that would be a cold and
                  unfriendly proceeding. And some one has written an additional line, adding the
                  reason why Menelaus had no invitation sent him, and yet came— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For well he knew how busy was his brother:</l>
                  </quote> as if there had been any need of alleging a reason why his brother should
                  come of his own accord to a banquet without any invitation,—a very sufficient
                  reason having been already given. <quote>For,</quote> said the interpolater of
                  this line, <quote>did he not know that his brother was giving a banquet? And how
                     can it be otherwise than absurd to pretend that he did not know it, when his
                     sacrifice of oxen was notorious and visible to every one? And how could he have
                     come if he had not <pb n="v.1.p.291"/> known it Or, by Jove, when he saw
                     him,</quote> he continues, <quote>occupied with business, was it not quite
                     right of him to excuse his not having sent him an invitation, and to come of
                     his own accord?</quote> As if he were to say that he came uninvited in order
                  that the next day they might not look at one another, the one with feelings of
                  mortification, ad the other of annoyance.</p>
               <p>But it would be an absurd thing to suppose that Menelaus forgot his brother, and
                  this, too, when he was not only sacrificing on his account at the present moment,
                  but when it was on his account that he had undertaken the whole war, and when he
                  had invited those who were no relations of his, and who had no connexion even with
                  his country. But Athenocles the Cyzicene, understanding the poems of Homer better
                  than Aristarchus did, speaks in a much more sensible manner to us, and says that
                  Homer omitted to mention Menelaus as having been invited because he was more
                  nearly related to Agamemnon than the others. But Demetrius Phalereus having
                  asserted that interpolated verse to be a bungling and unseasonable addition, quite
                  unsuited to the poetry of Homer,—-the verse, I mean, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For well he knew how busy was his brother,</l>
                  </quote> says that he is accusing him of very ungentlemanly manners. <quote>For I
                     think,</quote> says he, <quote>that every well-bred man has relations and
                     friends to whom he may go, when they are celebrating any sacrifice, without
                     waiting for them to send him an invitation.</quote>

            <div type="chapter" n="5">
               <p>And Plato in his Banquet speaks in the same manner on this subject.
                     <quote>For,</quote> says he, <quote>that we may destroy the proverb by altering
                     it: Good men may go of their own accord to feasts given by good men. For Homer
                     appears not only to have destroyed that proverb, but also to have ridiculed it;
                     for having represented Agamemnon as valiant in warlike matters, and Menelaus as
                     an effeminate warrior, when Agamemnon celebrates a sacrifice, he represents
                     Menelaus as coming uninvited,—that is, the worse man coming to the feast of the
                     better man.</quote> And Bacchylides, speaking of Hercules, and telling how he
                  came to the house of Ceyx, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  <pb n="v.1.p.292"/> And as to proverbs, one says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Good men do of their own accord</l>
                     <l>To good men's entertainments come:</l>
                  </quote> and another says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Brave men do of their own accord</l>
                     <l>To cowards' entertainments come.</l>
                  </quote> It was without reason, therefore, that Plato thought that Menelaus was a
                  coward; for Homer speaks of him as Mars-loving, and as fighting single-handed with
                  the greatest gallantry in defence of Patroclus, and eager to fight in single
                  combat with Hector as the champion of the whole army, although he certainly was
                  inferior to Hector in personal strength. And he is the only man in the whole
                  expedition of whom he has said— <quote rend="blockquote">

               </p>
               <p>But if an enemy, disparaging him, called him an effeminate warrior, and on this
                  account Plato thinks that he really was an effeminate warrior, why should he not
                  also class Agamemnon himself among the men void of prowess, since this line is
                  spoken against him?— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>O monster, mix'd of insolence and fear,</l>

               <p>For it does not follow because something is said in Homer, that Homer himself says
                  it. For how could Menelaus have been effeminate who, single-handed, kept Hector
                  away from Patroclus, and who slew Euphorbus, and stripped him of his arms though
                  in the very middle of the Trojan host? And it was foolish of him not completely to
                  consider the entire line which he was finding fault with, in which Menelaus is
                  called <quote>Raising the battle cry,</quote>
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοὴν ἀγαθὸς,</foreign> for that is an epithet which Homer is

               <p>But Homer, who is most accurate in everything, did not overlook even this trifling
                  point; that a man ought to show some care of his person, and to bathe himself
                  before going to an entertainment. And so, in the case of Ulysses, before the
                  banquet among the Phæacians, he tells us— <pb n="v.1.p.293"/>

                  over sweat and dust. For a well-bred man ought not to be dirty nor squalid, nor to
                  be all over mud, as Heraclitus says. And a man when he first enters another
                  person's house for a feast, ought not to hasten at once to the banqueting-room, as
                  if he had no care but to fill his stomach, but he ought first to indulge his fancy
                  in looking about him, and to examine the house. And the poet has not omitted to

                  </quote> And this ceremony Plato also observes in his Banquet. For he
                     says—<quote>Then after they had supped and made libations, they sang pæans to
                     the god with all customary honours.</quote> And Xenophon speaks in very nearly
                  the same terms. But in Epicurus there is no mention of any libation to the gods,
                  or of any offering of first-fruits. But as Simonides says of an immodest woman—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>He says too that the Athenians were taught the proper proportions in which wine
                  should be mixed by Amphictyon when he was king; and that on this account he
                  erected a temple to the Upright Bacchus. For he is then really upright and not
                  likely to fall, when he is drunk in proper proportions and well mixed; as Homer
                  has it— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> For Homer does not call wine <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλεὸς</foreign> in the
                  sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλίθιος,</foreign> that is to say, foolish and the
                  cause of folly. Nor does he bid a man be of a sullen countenance, neither singing
                  nor laughing, nor ever turning himself to cheerful dancing in time to music. He is
                  not so morose or ill-bred. But he knew the exact proportions in which all these
                  things should be done, and the proper qualities and quantities of wine to be
                  mixed. On which account he did not say that wine makes the sage sing, but sing
                  very much, that is to say, out of tune and excessively, so as to trouble people.
                  Nor, by Jove, did he say simply to smile, and to frisk about; but using the <pb n="v.1.p.295"/> word merry, and applying that to both, he reproves the un-
                  manly propensity to such trifling— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But in Plato none of these things are done in a moderate manner. But men
                  drink in such quantities that they cannot even stand on their feet. For just look
                  at the reveller Alcibiades, how unbecomingly he behaves. And all the rest drink a
                  large goblet holding eight cotylæ, using as an excuse that Alcibiades has led them
                  on; not like the men in Homer— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  he also took away the singer from the Cretan chorus, mutilating his song in the

               <p>And it is not probable that there were any musical entertainments at Menelaus's

                  occupied by the guests in conversation with one another; and that there is no name
                  mentioned as that of the minstrel; nor is any lay mentioned which he sang; nor is
                  it said that Telemachus and his party listened to him; but they rather
                  contemplated the house in silence, as it were, and perfect quiet. And how can it
                  be looked upon as anything but incredible, that the sons of those wisest of men,
                  Ulysses and Nestor, should be introduced as such ignorant people as, like clowns,
                  not to pay the least attention to carefully prepared music? At all events Ulysses

                  Pisistratus and gazed on nothing but the plate and furniture? But Homer, like a
                  good painter, makes Telemachus in every respect like his father; and so he has
                  made each of them easily recognised, the one by Alcinous, and the other by

               <p>Again, Epicurus, in his banquet, inquires about indigestion, so as to draw an omen
                  from the answer: and immediately after that he inquires about fevers; for why need
                  I speak of the general want of rhythm and elegance which pervades the whole essay?
                  But Plato, (I say nothing about his having been harassed by a cough, and about his
                  taking care of himself with constant gargling of water, and also by inserting a
                  straw, in order that he might excite his nose so as to sneeze; for his object was
                  to turn things into ridicule and to disparage them,) Plato, I say, turns into
                  ridicule the equalized sentences and the antitheses of Agathon, and introduces
                  Alcibiades, saying that he is in a state of excitement. But still those men who
                  write in this manner, propose to expel Homer from their cities. But, says
                  Demochares, <quote>A spear is not made of a stalk of savory,</quote> nor is a good
                  man made so by such discourses as these; and not only does he disparage <pb n="v.1.p.299"/> Alcibiades, but he also runs down Charmides, and Euthyde- mus,
                  and many others of the young men. And this is the conduct of a man ridiculing the
                  whole city of the Athenians, the Museum of Greece, which Pindar styled The Bulwark
                  of Greece; and Thucydides, in his Epigram address d to Euripides, The Greece of
                  Greece; and the priest at De phi termed it, The Hearth and Prytaneum of the
                  Greeks. And that he spoke falsely of the young men one may perceive from Plato
                  himself, for he says that Alcibiades, (in the dialogue to which he has prefixed
                  his name,) when he arrived at man's estate, then first began to converse with
                  Socrates, when every one else who was devoted to the pleasures of the body fell
                  off from him. But he says this at the very beginning of the dialogue. And how he
                  contradicts himself in the Charmides any one who pleases may see in the dialogue
                  itself. For he represents Socrates as subject to a most unseemly giddiness, and as
                  absolutely intoxicated with a passion for Alcibiades, and as becoming beside
                  himself, and yielding like a kid to the impetuosity of a lion; and at the same
                  time he says that he disregarded his beauty.</p>

               <p>But also the banquet of Xenophon, although it is much extolled, gives one as many
                  handles to blame it as the other. For Callias assembles a banqueting party because
                  his favourite Autolycus has been crowned at the Panathenæa for a victory gained in
                  the Pancratium. And as soon as they are assembled the guests devote their
                  attention to the boy; and this too while his father is sitting by. <quote>For as
                     when light appears in the night season it attracts the eyes of every one, so
                     does the beauty of Autolycus attract the eyes of everybody to itself. And then
                     there was no one present who did not feel something in his heart because of
                     him; but some were more silent than others, and some betrayed their feelings by
                     their gestures.</quote> But Homer has never ventured to say anything of that
                  sort, not even when he represents Helen as present; concerning whose beauty though
                  one of those who sat opposite to her did speak, all he said, being overcome by the
                  truth, was this— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But the young men who had come to Menelaus's court, the son of Nestor and
                  Telemachus, when over their wine, and celebrating a wedding feast, and though
                  Helen was sitting by, kept quite quiet in a decorous manner, being struck dumb by
                  her renowned beauty. But why did Socrates, when to gratify some one or other he
                  had tolerated some female flute-players, and some boy dancing and playing on the
                  harp, and also some women tumbling and posture-making in an unseemly manner,
                  refuse perfumes? For no one would have been able to restrain his laughter at him,
                  recollecting these lines— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You speak of those pale-faced and shoeless men,</l>
                     <l>Such as that wretched Socrates and Chærephon.</l>
                  </quote> And what followed after was very inconsistent with his austerity. For
                  Critobulus, a very well-bred young man, mocks Socrates, who was aged and his
                  tutor, saying he was much uglier than the Sileni; but he discusses beauty with
                  him, and selecting as judges the boy and the dancing woman, makes the prize to be
                  the kisses of the judges. Now what young man meeting with this writing would not
                  be corrupted rather than excited to virtue?</p>

               <p>Besides, the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλὴ</foreign> is not adapted to a house;

                  there are some sacred places called <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλῶνες,</foreign> which
                  are mentioned by Philochorus in his ninth book. And they use the word in the

                  in his fourth book; and as, in fact, all prose writers do. But the poets use it in
                  the feminine gender. Carcines says in his Achilles— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And therefore we ought to understand that it is used as a feminine noun

                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">θῆλυς ἐέρση,</foreign> where <foreign xml:lang="grc">θῆλυς</foreign> is feminine. Everything of that kind then is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλὴ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλών</foreign>; but at
                  the present day they call palaces <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλαὶ,</foreign> as

                  stationed, and took their rest in the open air. But Homer always classes the

                  the altar of Jupiter Herceus stood. And so Peleus is found— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Menelaus inserts it in his conversation very gracefully, after he has heard them
                  praise himself and his good fortune; not denying that he is rich, but from that

                  Telemachus was from his likeness to Ulysses, (for women, because of their habit of
                  observing one another's modesty, are wonderfully clever at detecting the likeness
                  of children to their parents,) and after Pisistratus had interfered with some
                  observation, (for it was not fitting for him to stand by like a mute on the

                  Telemachus; again Menelaus made mention of his affection for Ulysses, that of all
                  men in the world he was the one in whose companionship he wished to grow old.</p>

                  kinds, pours into some wine a medicinal panacea, as it was in reality; and begins
                  to relate some of the exploits of Ulysses, while working at her loom in the

                  been bred up in that way at home. And so Venus, coming to her after the single

                  proper to remain too long at the table. Accordingly, Minerva says, very
                  sententiously, in Homer— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For now has darkness quench'd the solar light,</l>

                  </quote> And now there is a law in existence that there are some sacrificial
                  feasts from which men must depart before sunset. And among the Egyptians formerly
                  every kind of banquet was conducted with great moderation; as Apollonis has said,
                  who wrote a treatise on the feasts of the Egyptian; for <pb n="v.1.p.306"/> they
                  ate in a sitting posture, using the very simplest and most wholesome food; and
                  only just as much wine as was calculated to put them in cheerful spirits, which is
                  what Pindar entreats of Jupiter— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>This is my prayer, my only prayer to thee.</l>
                  </quote> But the banquet of Plato is not an assembly of grave men, nor a
                  conversazione of philosophers. For Socrates does not choose to depart from the
                  banquet, although Eryximachus, and Phædrus, and some others, have already left it;
                  but he stays till a late hour with Agathon and Aristophanes, and drinks from the
                  silver well; for fairly has some one given this name to large cups. And he drinks
                  out of the bowl cleverly, like a man who is used to it. And Plato says, that after
                  this those two others began to nod, and that first of all Aristophanes fell
                  asleep, and when day began to break so did Agathon; and that Socrates, after he
                  had sent them both to sleep, rose up from table himself and went away to the
                  Lyceum, when he might, says Herodicus, have gone to Homer's Læstrygones— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But every banqueting party among the ancients was referred to the gods; and
                  accordingly men wore garlands appropriate and peculiar to the gods, and used hymns
                  and odes. And there were no slaves to attend upon the guests, but free youths
                  acted as the cupbearers. So the son of Mænelaus, although he was the bridegroom,
                  and at his own wedding, acted; and in the poem of the beautiful Sappho, even
                  Mercury acts as the cupbearer to the gods. And they were free men who prepared
                  everything else for the guests. And after they had supped they went away while it
                  was still daylight. But at some of the Persian feasts there were also councils
                  held, as there were in the tent of Agamemnon with respect to the further conduct
                  of the Trojan war. Now as to the entertainment given by Alcinous, to which the
                  discourse of Ulysses refers where he says— <pb n="v.1.p.307"/>

                  </quote> He refers also especially to his reception of straners, since the
                  Phæacians themselves were devoted to luxury and yet if any one compares that feast
                  made by Alcinous with the banquets of the philosophers, he will find that the
                  better regulated of the two; although that also embraced much cheerfulness and
                  spirit, only not in any unbecoming manner. For after the exhibition of gymnastics

                  suggested to Ulysses some hints for the slaughter of the suitors; since Vulcan,

               <p>And the feasters of that time sat at the table; at all events, Homer very often

                  this line, when taken by itself, is a seat such as is used by free men, with a
                  footstool, the name of which being <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρῆνυς,</foreign> from
                  thence they came to call the seat itself <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρόνος,</foreign>
                  from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρήσασθαι,</foreign> which they used for, to
                  sit; as Philetas says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  for reclining on; and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίφρος</foreign> is something
                  simpler than these things. Accordingly, in the book where Ulysses appears as a
                  beggar the servants place for him, as Homer tells us, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>A humble chair (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δίφρος</foreign>), and spread a scanty
                        board.</l>
                  </quote> But their goblets, as their name (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κρατῆρες</foreign>) indicates, were supplied full of wine mixed with water
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκραμένοι</foreign>); and the youths ministered to them
                  from the larger goblets, always, in the case of the most honourable of the guests,
                  keeping their small cups full; but to the rest they distributed the wine in equal
                  portions. Accordingly Agamemnon says to Idomeneus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  there was no need for the carver to bring in more, so that some of the above
                  description is superfluous. But when the guests had departed the tables were
                  removed, as is done at the feasts of the Suitors and of the Phæacians, in whose
                  case he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  of him, "He, escaping out of the palace without the knowledge of the attendants,
                  was often found with one or two companions wandering about the city wherever he
                  might chance to take it into his head to go. And he was, above all other places,
                  frequently found at the shops of the engravers of silver and of the goldsmiths,
                  conversing on the subject of their inventions with, and inquiring into the
                  principles of their art from, the engravers and other artists. And besides this,
                  he often used to go among the common people, conversing with whomsoever he might
                  chance to meet; and he would drink with the lowest and poorest strangers. And
                  whenever he heard of any young men having a banquet, without having given any
                  notice of his intention, he would come to join in their feast with a flute and
                  music, behaving in a most lascivious manner; so that many used to rise up and
                  depart, being alarmed at his strange behaviour. Often, also, he would lay aside
                  his royal robes, and put on a common cloak, and so go round the market, like a man
                  who was a candidate for some office: and taking some people by the hand, and
                  embracing others, he would solicit them to vote for him, sometimes begging to be
                  made ædile, and sometimes tribune; and when he was elected, sitting in his ivory
                  curule chair, according to the fashion which prevails among the Romans, he would
                  hear all the causes which were pleaded in the forum, and decide them with great
                  attention and earnestness, by which conduct he greatly perplexed sensible men, For
                  some thought him a man of very simple tastes, and others considered him mad. And
                  his conduct with respect to presents was very much the same. For he would give
                  some people dice of antelope's bones, and some he would present with dates, and to
                  others he would give gold. And even if he met people in the street whom he had
                  never seen, he would give them presents unexpectedly. And in his sacrifices, which
                  were offered up in the different cities, and in the honours offered to the gods,
                  he surpassed all the kings who had ever existed. And any one may conjecture his
                  from the temple raised to Olympian Jupiter at Athens, and from the statues around
                  the altar at Delos. And he used to bathe in the public baths, often when they were
                  complete y full of the citizens, and then he would have earthen pairs of the <pb n="v.1.p.310"/> most expensive perfumes brought to him. And on one of these
                  occasions, when some one said to him, <quote>Happy are you kings, who use all
                     these things and smell so sweet,</quote> he made the man no answer at the time;
                  but coming the next day to the place where he was bathing, he caused him to have a
                  pan of the largest size of that most precious ointment called <foreign xml:lang="grc">στακτὴ</foreign> poured over his head, so that when that had been
                  done, every one near got up and hastened to get a little of the ointment, and as
                  they fell down in their haste, by reason of the slipperiness of the floor, every
                  one laughed, as did the king himself.</p>

                  <quote>And this same king,</quote> continues Polybius, "having heard of the games
                  which had been celebrated in Macedonia by Aemilius Paullus the Roman general,
                  wishing to surpass Paullus in his magnificence and liberality, sent ambassadors
                  and theori to the different cities to proclaim that games were going to be
                  exhibited by him at Daphne, so that the Greeks all hastened with great eagerness
                  to come to him to see them. And the beginning of the exhibition was a splendid
                  procession, arranged in this way:—Some men led the way armed in the Roman fashion,
                  in breastplates of chain armour, all men in the flower of their youth, to the
                  number of five thousand; immediately after them, five thousand Mysians followed;
                  and then three thousand Cilicians, armed in the fashion of light-armed
                  skirmishers, having golden crowns; and after them three thousand Thracians and
                  five thousand Galatians; these were followed by twenty thousand Macedonians, and
                  by five thousand men armed with brazen shields, and as many more with silver
                  shields; they were followed by two hundred and forty pair of gladiators to fight
                  in single combat; behind these came a thousand Nisæan cavalry, and three thousand
                  men of the city guard, the greatest part of whom had golden trappings and golden
                  crowns, but some had silver trappings; to these succeeded the cavalry who are
                  called the King's Companions; these amounted to one thousand men, all equipped
                  with golden trappings; next to these was the battalion of the King's Friends, of
                  the same number and the same equipment; after these a thousand picked men; and
                  they were followed by what was called the Agema, which was considered to be the
                  most excellent squadron of all the cavalry, to the number of <pb n="v.1.p.311"/>
                  a thousand men; last of all came the Fenced Cavalry, having its name from the fact
                  that both men and horses were com- pletely enveloped in armour; they were in
                  number fifteen hundred men. And all the above-mentioned soldiers had purple
                  cloaks, and many had them also embroidered with gold or painted with figures of
                  living animals. Besides all this, there were a hundred chariots with six horses,
                  and forty with four horses; then a chariot drawn by four elephants, and another by
                  two; and last of all, six-and-thirty elephants, all handsomely appointed, followed
                  one by one.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="23">
               <p>"The rest of the procession was such as it is difficult adequately to describe,
                  and it must be enumerated in a summary manner. For youths walked in the procession
                  to the number of eight hundred, all having golden crowns; and fat oxen to the
                  number of one thousand; and deputations to see to the performance of separate
                  sacrifices, very little short of three hundred; and there were eight hundred
                  elephants' teeth carried by, and such a multitude of statues as it is beyond any
                  one's power to enumerate. For images were carried in the procession of all who are
                  ever said or thought by men to be gods, or deities, or demigods, or heroes; some
                  gilt all over, and some arrayed in golden-broidered robes. And to all of them
                  suitable inscriptions according to the accounts commonly received of them were
                  attached, earved in the most expensive materials. And they were followed by an
                  image of Night and another of Day; and of the Earth, and of Heaven, and of
                  Morning, and of Noon. And the vast quantity of gold plate and silver plate was
                  such as perhaps a man may form a guess at from the following account. For a
                  thousand slaves belonging to Dionysius the secretary and amanuensis of the king
                  joined in the procession, each carrying articles of silver plate, of which there
                  was not one weighing less than a thousand drachmæ. And there were six hundred
                  slaves belonging to the king himself, carrying articles of gold plate. And besides
                  them there were women to the number of two hundred sprinkling every one with
                  perfume out of golden waterpots. And they were succeeded by eighty women
                  magnificently apparelled, borne on palanquins with golden feet, and five hundred
                  borne on palanquins wit silver feet. And this was the most important portion of
                  the procession.</p>

                  <quote>But after the games were over and the single combats and the hunting,
                     during the whole thirty days which he exhibited these shows, on the first five
                     days every one who came into the gymnasium was anointed with a saffron perfume
                     shed upon him out of golden dishes. And there were fifteen of these golden
                     dishes, full of equal quantities of cinnamon and spikenard. And in a similar
                     manner in the five next days there was brought in essence of fenugreek, and of
                     amaracus, and of lilies, all differing in their scent; and some days there were
                     laid a thousand triclinia for the banquet; and some days fifteen hundred, all
                     laid in the most expensive possible manner. And the arrangement of the whole
                     business was superintended by the king himself. For having a very fine horse he
                     went up and down the whole procession, commanding some to advance, and others
                     to halt. And stopping at the entrances of the rooms where the drinking was
                     going on he brought some in, and to others he assigned places on the couches.
                     And he himself conducted in the attendants who brought in the second course.
                     And he went round the whole banquet, sometimes sitting down in one place, and
                     presently lying down in another place. And sometimes even while he was eating
                     he would lay down what he was eating or his cup, and jump up, and go away to
                     another part of the room. And he would go all round the company, at times,
                     pledging some of the guests in a standing posture; and at times entertaining
                     himself with the jesters or with the music. And when the entertainment had
                     lasted a long time and many of the guests had gone away, then the king would be
                     brought in by buffoons, all covered up, and laid on the ground as if he had
                     been one of their band. And when the music excited him, he would jump up and
                     dance, and act with the mummers, so that every one felt ashamed for him and
                     fled away. And all this was done partly with the treasure which he brought out
                     of Egypt, having plundered Ptolemy Philometor the king there, in defiance of
                     his treaty with him when he was but a little boy; and some of the money too was
                     contributed by his friends. And he had also sacrilegiously plundered most of
                     the temples in his dominions.</quote>

               <p>And while all the guests marvelled at the conduct of the king, seeing that he was
                  not illustrious but absolutely mad, Masurius brought forward Callixenus the
                  Rhodian, who <pb n="v.1.p.313"/> in the fourth book of his History of Alexandria
                  has given an account of a spectacle and procession which was exhibited by that
                  most admirable of all monarchs, Ptolemy Phiadelphus. And he says—"But before I
                  begin, I will give a description of the tent which was prepared within the circuit
                  of the citadel, apart from the place provided for the reception of the soldiers,
                  and artisans, and foreigners. For it was wonderfully beautiful, and worth hearing
                  about. Its size was such as to be able to hold a hundred and thirty couches placed
                  in a circle, and it was furnished in the following manner:—There were wooden
                  pillars at intervals, five on each side of the tent longwise, fifty cubits high,
                  and something less than one cubit broad. And on these pillars at the top was a
                  capital, of square figure, carefully fitted, supporting the whole weight of the
                  roof of the banqueting room. And over this was spread in the middle a scarlet veil
                  with a white fringe, like a canopy; and on each side it had beams covered over
                  with turreted veils, with white centres, on which canopies embroidered all over
                  the centre were placed. And of the pillars four were made to resemble palm-trees,
                  and they had in the centre a representation of thyrsi. And on the outside of these
                  a portico ran, adorned with a peristyle on three sides, with a vaulted roof. And
                  in this place it was intended that the company of the feasters should sit down.
                  And the interior of it was surrounded with scarlet curtains. But in the middle of
                  the space there were strange hides of beasts, strange both as to their variegated
                  colour and their size, suspended. And the part which surrounded this portico in
                  the open air was shaded by myrtle-trees and daphnes, and other suitable shrubs.
                  And the whole floor was strewed with flowers of every description. For Egypt, on
                  account of the temperate character of the atmosphere which surrounds it, and on
                  account of the fondness of the inhabitants for gardening, produces in great
                  abundance, and all the year round, those things which in other countries are
                  rarely found, and only at particular seasons. And roses, and white lilies, and
                  numberless other flowers are never wanting in that country. On which account,
                  though this entertainment took place in the middle of winter, still there was a
                  show of flowers which was quite incredible to the foreigners. For flowers of which
                  one could not easily have found enough to make one chaplet in any other city <pb n="v.1.p.314"/> were supplied in the greatest abundance here, to make chaplets
                  for every one of the guests at this entertainment, and were strewed thickly over
                  the whole floor of the tent; so as really to give the appearance of a most divine
                  meadow.</p>

               <p>"And by the posts round the entire tent there were placed animals carved in marble
                  by the first artists, a hundred in number. And in the spaces between the posts
                  there were pictures hung by the Sicyonian painters; and alternately with these
                  there were carefully selected images of every kind; and garments embroidered with
                  gold, and most exquisite cloaks, some of them having portraits of the kings of
                  Egypt embroidered on them; and some, stories taken from the mythology. Above them
                  were placed gold and silver shields alternately; and on the spaces above these
                  shields, which were eight cubits high, caves were made, six on each side of the
                  tent longwise, and four at each end. There were likewise in them representations
                  of eating parties opposite to one another, of tragic, and comic, and satyric
                  animals, having on real clothes. And before them were placed golden goblets. And
                  in the middle of the caves were placed nymphæa, and on them there lay golden
                  Delphian tripods, having pedestals of their own. And along the highest part of the
                  roof were golden eagles all facing one another, each fifteen cubits large. There
                  were also golden couches, with feet made like sphinxes, on the two sides of the
                  tent, a hundred on each side. For the front of the tent was left open. And under
                  these there were strewed purple carpets of the finest wool, with the carpet
                  pattern on both sides. And there were handsomely embroidered rugs very beautifully
                  elaborated on them. Besides this, thin Persian cloths covered all the centre space
                  where the guests walked, having most accurate representations of animals
                  embroidered on them. And by them were placed tripods for the guests, made of gold,
                  two hundred in number, so that there were two for every couch, and they rested on
                  silver pedestals. And behind, out of sight, there were a hundred flat dishes of
                  silver, and an equal number of lavers. On the opposite side of the sitting-room
                  there was fixed another sideboard, opposite to that on which the cups and goblets
                  were placed; and on that were all the rest of the things which had been prepared
                  for, or could come into use. And they were all made of gold, and studded with
                  precious stones; <pb n="v.1.p.315"/> admirably carved and wrought. And it has
                  appeared to me too long a task to undertake to enumerate every article of the
                  furniture, and even all the different kinds separate. But the entire weight of all
                  the plate and valuables there exhibited came to ten thousand talents.</p>

               <p>"But now that we have gone over everything that was to be seen in the tent, we
                  will proceed to the shows and processions exhibited. For it passed through the
                  stadium which there is in the city. And first of all went the procession of
                  Lucifer. For it began at the time when that star first appears. After that came
                  the procession which bore the name of the parents of the kings. And next came the
                  processions sacred to all the gods respectively, each having an arrangement
                  appropriate to the history of each separate deity. Last of all came the procession
                  of Hesperus, as the hour of that one starting coincided with that time. But if any
                  one wishes to know the separate particulars, he may take the description of the
                  quinquennial games and consider them. But in the Dionysiac procession first of all
                  there went the Sileni who keep off the multitude, some clad in purple cloaks, and
                  some in scarlet ones. And these were followed by Satyrs, twenty in each division
                  of the stadium, bearing gilded lamps made of ivy-wood. And after them came images
                  of Victory, having golden wings, and they bore in their hands incense-burners six
                  cubits in height, adorned with branches made of ivy-wood and gold, clad in tunics
                  embroidered with figures of animals, and they themselves also had a great deal of
                  golden ornament about them. And after them there followed an altar of six cubits
                  in height, a double altar, covered all over with ivy-leaves gilded, having a crown
                  of vine-leaves on it all gold, enveloped in bandages with white centres. And that
                  was followed by boys in purple tunics, bearing frankincense, and myrrh, and
                  saffron, on golden dishes. And after them came forty Satyrs, crowned with
                  ivy-garlands made of gold. And they were painted as o their bodies, some with
                  purple, some with vermilion, an some with other colours. And these also wore each
                  a golden crown made to imitate vine-leaves and ivy-leaves. And after them came two
                  Sileni in purple cloaks and white fringes to them. And one of them had a petasus
                  and a golden caduceus, and the other had a trumpet. And between them went a man of
                     <pb n="v.1.p.316"/> gigantic size, four cubits high, in a tragical dress and
                  orna- ments, bearing the golden horn of Amalthea. And his name was Eniautos.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ʼἐνιαυτὸς,</foreign> a year.</note> And he was followed
                  by a woman of great beauty and of more than ordinary size, adorned with quantities
                  of gold and a superb dress; bearing in one of her hands a garland of peach
                  blossoms, and in her other hand a branch of the palm-tree. And she was called
                     Penteteris.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντετηοὶς,</foreign> a period of five years.</note> And
                  she was succeeded by the Four Seasons dressed in character, and each of them
                  bearing its appropriate fruits. Next to them came two incense-burners made of
                  ivy-wood, covered with gold, and six cubits in height, and a large square golden
                  altar in the middle of them. And then again Satyrs, having garlands of ivy-leaves
                  made of gold, and clad in purple robes. And some of them bore golden wine-jars,
                  and others bore goblets. After them marched Philiscus the poet, being a priest of
                  Bacchus, and with him all the artisans who were concerned in the service of
                  Bacchus. And next to them were carried the Delphian tripods, as prizes for the
                  trainers of the athletes; the one for the trainer of the boys nine cubits in
                  height, and the other, twelve cubits in height, for the trainer of the men.</p>

               <p>"After them was a four-wheeled wagon fourteen cubits long, and eight cubits wide;
                  and it was drawn by a hundred and eighty men; and in it was placed an image of
                  Bacchus ten cubits high, pouring libations of wine out of a golden goblet, having
                  on a purple tunic reaching down to the feet; and he was clad in a purple garment
                  embroidered with gold; and in front of him there lay a golden Lacedæmonian goblet,
                  holding fifteen measures of wine, and a golden tripod, in which was a golden
                  incense-burner, and two golden bowls, full of cassia and saffron; and a shade
                  covered it round adorned with ivy-leaves, and vine-leaves, and all sorts of other
                  green leaves; and to it were fastened chaplets, and fillets, and thyrsi, and
                  drums, and turbans, and satyric and comic and tragic masks. And the wagon was
                  followed by priests and priestesses, and newly initiated votaries, and by
                  companies of every nation, and by people bearing the mystic fan. And after this
                  came the Bacchanalian women, called Macetæ, and Mimallones, and Bassaræ, and
                  Lydians, with dishevelled hair, and wearing garlands, some of snakes, and others
                  of <pb n="v.1.p.317"/> branches of yew and of vine-leaves and ivy-leaves, and
                  some held daggers in their hands, and others held snakes. And after them another
                  four-wheeled wagon was drawn of the width of eight cubits, and it was drawn by
                  sixty men and in it was a statue of Nysa, of eight cubits high, in a sitting
                  posture, clothed in a box-coloured tunic embroidered with gold, and it was also
                  clad in a Laconian cloak; and this statue rose up by mechanism, without any one
                  applying his hand to it; and it poured libations of milk out of a golden bottle,
                  and then it sat down again; and in its left hand it bore a thyrsus wrapped round
                  with turbans, and it was crowned with a garland of ivy-leaves, made of gold, and
                  with gorgeous bunches of grapes inlaid with precious stones; and it had a parasol
                  over it; and on the corners of the wagon were fastened four golden lamps.</p>

                  there was a wine-press twenty-four cubits in length and fifteen in breadth, full
                  of grapes; and sixty Satyrs were trampling on the grapes, singing a song in praise
                  of the wine-press, to the music of a flute. And Silenus presided over them; and
                  the new wine ran out over the whole road. Next to that was drawn along a wagon,
                  twenty-five cubits long and fourteen broad; and that was drawn by six hundred men.
                  And on this wagon was a sack holding three thousand measures of wine, consisting
                  of leopards' skins, sewn together. And this too allowing its liquor to escape,
                  gradually flowed over the whole road. And it was followed by Satyri and Sileni, to
                  the number of a hundred and twenty, all wearing garlands, and carrying some casks
                  of wine, and some bowls, and some large Thericlean goblets, all made of gold.</p>

                  things worth looking at, which were all carried round for the spectators to see,
                  being beautifully wrought. "And among them was a representation of the bed-chamber
                  of Semele, in which were seen statues clad in golden tunics, inlaid with precious
                  stones of the greatest value. And it would not be right to pass over this
                  four-wheeled wagon, of the length of twenty-two cubits and of the breadth of
                  fourteen, drawn by five hundred men. And on it was a cave exceedingly deep,
                  overgrown with ivy and yew, and out of it flew doves, and pigeons, and
                  turtle-doves, all along the road as the wagon proceeded, having their feet tied
                  with slight threads, so as to be easily caught by the spectators. And out of the
                  cave there also rose two fountains, one of milk and one of wine, and around it all
                  the nymphs had garlands of gold, and Mercury had a golden herald's wand, and very
                  superb raiment. And on another four-wheeled wagon, on which the return of Bacchus
                  from the Indians was represented, there was a figure of Bacchus twelve cubits
                  high, riding upon an elephant, clad in a purple robe, and having on a crown of
                  vine-leaves and ivy-leaves o gold, and bearing in his hands a spear like a
                  thyrsus, made also of gold; and he wore sandals embroidered with golden figures.

                  height, crowned with a chaplet of golden pine-leaves, and holding in his right
                  hand a goat's horn made of golden, with which he appeared to be blowing signals.
                  And the elephant had golden furniture; and on his neck he had a crown of
                  ivy-leaves made of gold; and he was followed by <pb n="v.1.p.320"/> five hundred

                  of the size of ten cubits each, and a garland of oak-leaves studded with precious
                  stones; and twenty golden shields, and sixty-four suits of complete armour also of
                  gold, and two golden greaves three cubits in height, and twelve golden dishes, and
                  a most countless number of flagons, and thirty-six vessels for wine, and ten large
                  anointing vessels, and twelve ewers, and fifty large dishes for barley loaves, and
                  tables of different sorts, and five repositories for gold plate, and a horn thirty
                  cubits long made of solid gold. And all these articles of gold plate were
                  exclusive of those carried in the procession of Bacchus. Then there were four
                  hundred wagons of silver plate, and twenty wagons of gold plate, and eight hundred

                     twenty-three thousand two hundred. And all these marched in the procession, all

               <p>Now my friends and fellow-banqueters, what kingdom ever possessed such quantities
                  of gold as this? For Egypt did not acquire all this by taking money from the
                  Persians and from Babylon, or by working mines, or by having a river Pactolus,
                  bearing down gold-dust in its waters. For its only river is that which can really
                  be called the Golden Stream—the Nile, which together with its boundless supplies
                  of food does bring down gold without alloy, which is dug up out of the soil
                  without danger, in quantities sufficient for all men, diffused over the whole soil
                  like the gifts of Triptolemus. On which account the Byzantine poet, who had the
                  name of Parmeno given to him, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>O god of Egypt, mighty Nile.</l>
                  </quote> But king Philadelphus surpassed most kings in riches; and he pursued
                  every kind of manufacturing and trading art so zealously, that he also surpassed
                  every one in the number of his ships. Now the largest ships which he had were
                  these:— two of thirty banks of oars, one of twenty, four of thirteen, two of
                  twelve, fourteen of eleven, thirty of nine, thirty-seven of seven, five of six,
                  seventeen of five. And from quadriremes down to light half-decked triremes, for
                  purposes of war, he had twice as many as all these put together. And the vessels
                  which were sent to the different islands and to the other cities under his
                  dominion, and to Libya, amounted to more than four thousand. And concerning the
                  numbers of his books, and the way in which he furnished his libraries, and the way

               <p>But since we have mentioned the subject of the building of ships, let us speak
                  (for it is worth hearing of) of the ships which were built also by Ptolemy
                  Philopator, which are mentioned by the same Callixenus in the first book of his
                  Account of Alexandria, where he speaks as follows:—"Philopator built a ship with
                  forty ranks of rowers, being two hundred and eighty cubits long and thirty-eight
                  cubits from one side to the other; and in height up to the gunwale it was
                  forty-eight cubits; and from the highest part of the stern to the water-line was
                  fifty-three cubits; and it had four rudders, <pb n="v.1.p.325"/> each thirty
                  cubits long; and oars for the thranitæ, the largest thirty-eight cubits in length,
                  which, from having lead in their handles, and because they were very heavy it the
                  part inside the ship, being accurately balanced, were, in spite of their bulk,
                  very handy to use. And the ship had two heads and two sterns, and seven beaks, one
                  of which was longer than all the rest, and the others were of smaller size; and
                  some of them were fixed to the ears of the ship; and it had twelve undergirths to
                  support the keel, and each was six hundred cubits in length. And it was well
                  proportioned to a most extraordinary degree; and all the appointments of the
                  vessel were admirable, for it had figures of animals on it not less than twelve
                  cubits in size, both at the head and at the stern, and every part of it was inlaid
                  and ornamented with figures in wax; and the space between the oars down to the
                  very keel had a running pattern of ivy-leaves and thyrsi; and there was great
                  store of every kind of equipment to supply all parts of the ship that might
                  require any.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">There is great uncertainty as
                     to the meaning of this passage; some commentators consider that there is some
                     corruption in the text.</note> And when it put to sea it held more than four
                  thousand rowers, and four hundred supernumeraries; and on the deck were three
                  thousand marines, or at least two thousand eight hundred and fifty. And besides
                  all these there was another large body of men under the decks, and a vast quantity
                  of provisions and supplies. And the vessel was launched originally from a sort of
                  framework, which they say was erected and made out of the wood of fifty ships of
                  five ranks of oars; and it was launched by the multitude with great acclamations
                  and blowing of trumpets. But after that a Phœnician devised a new method of
                  launching it, having dug a trench under it, equal to the ship itself in length,
                  which he dug close to the harbour. And in the trench he built props of solid stone
                  five cubits deep, and across them he laid beams crosswise, running the whole width
                  of the trench, at four cubits' distance from one another; and then making a
                  channel from the sea he filled all the space which he had excavated with water,
                  out of which he easily brought the ship by the aid of whatever men happened to be
                  at hand; then closing the entrance which had been originally made, he drained the
                  water off again by means of engines; and when this had been done the vessel rested
                  securely on the before-mentioned cross-beams.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="38">
               <p>"Philopator also built a vessel for the river which he called Thalamegus, or the
                  Carrier of his Bed-chamber, in length half a stadium, and in width at the broadest
                  part thirty cubits; and the height together with the frame for the awning was
                  little short of forty cubits. And its appearance was not exactly like ships of
                  war, nor merchant vessels either, but it was something different from both, on
                  account of the necessity imposed by the depth of the river. For below it was flat
                  and broad; but in its main hull it was high. And the parts at the extremity, and
                  especially at the head, extended a sufficient length, so as to exhibit a very
                  pretty and elegant sweep. This ship also had two heads and two sterns. And it rose
                  to a considerable height above the water, as was necessary, because the waves in
                  the river often rise very high. And in the middle of its hull were constructed
                  banqueting-rooms and sleeping-rooms, and everything else which may be convenient
                  for living in. And round the ship were double corridors running about three sides,
                  each of which was not less than five plethra in circumference. And the arrangement
                  of the lower one was like a peristyle, and that in the upper part was covered in,
                  and surrounded with walls and windows on all sides. And when you first came into
                  the vessel by the stern your eye was met by a colonnade, open in front, and
                  surrounded by pillars. And opposite to it in the bow of the vessel there was a
                  sort of propylæum constructed, made of ivory and most expensive woods. And after
                  you had passed through that, then you came to something like a proscenium, covered
                  in overhead. And again in the same way in the middle of the vessel was another
                  colonnade, open behind, and an entrance of four folding-doors led to it. And both
                  on the right hand and on the left there were windows, admitting a pleasant
                  breeze.</p>
               <p>"To these was joined a room of very large size, and that was adorned with pillars
                  all round, and it was capable of containing twenty couches. And the greater part
                  of it was made of split cedar, and of Milesian cypress. And the doors which were
                  round it, being twenty in number, were put together with beams of citron wood,
                  having ivory ornaments. And all the nails and fastenings which were visible were
                  made of red brass, which had taken a polish like that of gold from the fire. And
                  of the pillars the bodies were of cypress-wood, but the capitals were of
                  Corinthian workmanship, adorned with ivory and gold. The whole of the capitals of
                  the pillars <pb n="v.1.p.327"/> were of gold; and there was a sort of girdle on
                  them having figures of animals beautifully carved in ivory, more than a cubit
                  high, of which the workmanship was not so conspicuous as the exquisite beauty of
                  the materials. There was a beautiful roof to the banqueting-room, square, and made
                  of cypress wood. And its ornaments were all carved, having a golden face. Next to
                  this banqueting-chamber was a sleeping-chamber holding seven couches; and to that
                  there was joined a narrow passage, which separated the woman's chamber from this
                  one by the width of the hold. And by the passage was a bauqueting-room holding
                  nine couches, very like the large one in the sumptuousness of its furniture; and a
                  bedchamber holding five couches. As to the rooms then on the first deck this was
                  the general appearance presented.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="39">
               <p>"But when you had ascended by the stairs which were close to the before-mentioned
                  sleeping chamber, there was another chamber capable of containing five couches,
                  having a vaulted oblong roof. And near to it was a temple of Venus, in form like a
                  rotunda, in which was a marble statue of the goddess. And opposite to this was
                  another banqueting-room, very sumptuous, adorned all round with columns: for the
                  columns were all made of Indian stone. And near to this banqueting-room were more
                  sleeping-chambers, with furniture and appointments corresponding to what has been,
                  already mentioned. And as you went on towards the head of the vessel was another
                  apartment dedicated to Bacchus, capable of holding thirteen couches, surrounded
                  with pillars having its cornices all gilt as far down as the epistyle which ran
                  round the room, but the roof corresponded to the character of the god. And in it
                  there was on the right hand a large cave constructed, the colour of which was
                  stone, for in fact it was made of real stone and gold; and in it images were
                  placed of all the relations of the king, made of the stone called lychnites. And
                  there was another banqueting-room, very pleasant, above the roof of the greatest
                  apartment, having an arrangement like that of a tent, so that some of it had no
                  actual roof; but there were arched and vaulted beams running along the top at
                  intervals, along which purple curtains were stretched whenever the vessel was in
                  motion. And after this there was an open chamber occupying the same room above
                  that was occupied by the portico before mentioned as being below. And a winding
                     <pb n="v.1.p.328"/> ladder joined on to it, leading to the secret walk, and a
                  banqueting-room capable of containing nine couches, constructed and furnished in
                  the Egyptian style. For round pillars were run up in it, with alternate tambours
                  of white and black, all placed in parallel lines. And their heads were of round
                  shape; and the whole of the figures round them were engraved like roses a little
                  expanded. And round that part which is called the basket there were not tendrils
                  and rough leaves, as is the case in Grecian pillars, but calyxes of the
                  river-lotus, and the fruit of newly budding dates. And sometimes many other kinds
                  of flowers were also represented. And under the roof of the capital which lies
                  upon the tambour, where it joins on to the head, there were ornaments like the
                  flower leaves of the Egyptian bean intertwined together. This then is the way in
                  which the Egyptians construct and ornament their pillars, and this is the way in
                  which they variegate their walls with black and white bricks: and sometimes also
                  they employ the stone which is called alabaster. And there were many other
                  ornaments all over the main hull of the vessel, and over the centre, and many
                  other chambers and divisions in every part of it.</p>

                  <quote>And the mast of this vessel was seventy cubits in height, and it had a
                     linen sail, adorned with a purple fringe. And the whole of the wealth which had
                     been so carefully preserved by king Philadelphus was dissipated by the last
                     Ptolemy, who also excited the war against Gabinius, who was not a man, but a

               <p>But concerning the ship built by Hiero, the tyrant of Syracuse, which also
                  Archimedes the geometrician superintended, I do not think it right to be silent,
                  since a certain man named Moschion has given a description of it, which I read
                  over with great care very lately.</p>
               <p>Moschion, then, writes as follows:—"Diocles, a citizen of Abdera, speaks with
                  great admiration of the engine called Helepolis, which was brought by Demetrius
                  against the city of the Rhodians, and applied to their walls. And Timæus extols
                  highly the funeral pile made for Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily. And Hieronymus
                  lavishes his admiration on the building and adorning of the chariot in which the
                  body of Alexander was borne to the tomb. And Polycletus speaks in high terms of
                  the candlestick which was made for the king of <pb n="v.1.p.329"/> Persia. But
                  Hiero, the king of the Syracusans, who was in every respect a friend to the
                  Romans, was very attentive to the furnishing of temples and gymnasia; and was also
                  very earnest in ship-building, having built a great number of vessels to carry
                  corn; the construction of one of which I will describe. For the wood, he caused
                  such a number of trees to be cut down on Mount Aetna as would have been sufficient
                  for sixty triremes, and when this was done he prepared nails, and planks for the
                  sides and for the inside, and wood for every other purpose that could be required,
                  some from Italy and some from Sicily. And for ropes he provided cordage from
                  Spain, and hemp, and pitch from the river Rhone; and he collected great quantities
                  of useful things from all quarters. And he collected also shipwrights and other
                  artisans. And having appointed Archias the Corinthian the superintendent of them
                  all, and the principal architect, he bade them labour at the construction with
                  zeal and earnestness, he himself also devoting his days to watching its progress.
                  And in this way he finished half the ship in six months; and every part of the
                  vessel as soon as it was finished was immediately covered over with plates of
                  lead. And there were three hundred workmen employed in working up the timber,
                  besides the subord nate journeymen whom they had to assist them. And it was
                  arranged to draw this portion that was done so far down to the sea, that it might
                  receive the last finishing strokes there. And when there was a great inquiry as to
                  the best method of launching it into the sea, Archimedes the mechanician launched
                  it by himself with the aid of a few persons. Eor having prepared a helix he drew
                  this vessel, enormous as it was, down into the sea. And Archimedes was the first
                  person who ever invented this helix. But after the remainder of the ship had also
                  been completed in six months more, and it had been surrounded all round with
                  brazen nails, the greater part of which weighed ten minæ, and the rest were half
                  as big again—(and they were driven in through holes made beforehand by gimlets, so
                  as to hold the planks firm; and they were fastened to the wood with leaden plugs;
                  pieces of cloth being put under, impregnated with pitch)—after, I say, Hiero had
                  completed the external figure of the vessel, he laboured at the interior.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="41">
               <p>"And the vessel was constructed with twenty banks of <pb n="v.1.p.330"/> oars,
                  and three entrances, having the lowest entrance leading to the hold, to which the
                  descent was by two ladders of many steps each: and the next was contrived for
                  those who wished to go down to the eating-rooms: and the third was for the armed
                  men. And on each side of the middle entrance were apartments for the men, each
                  with four couches in them, thirty in number. And the supper-room for the sailors
                  was capable of holding fifteen couches, and it had within it three chambers, each
                  containing three couches; and the kitchen was towards the stern of the ship. And
                  all these rooms had floors composed of mosaic work, of all kinds of stones
                  tesselated. And on this mosaic the whole story of the Iliad was depicted in a
                  marvellous manner. And in all the furniture and the ceilings and the doors
                  everything was executed and finished in the same admirable manner. And along the
                  uppermost passage was a gymnasium and walks, having their appointments in all
                  respects corresponding to the size of the vessel. And in them were gardens of all
                  sorts of most wonderful beauty, enriched with all sorts of plants, and shaded by
                  roofs of lead or tiles. And besides this there were tents roofed with boughs of
                  white ivy and of the vine, the roots of which derived their moisture from casks
                  full of earth, and were watered in the same manner as the gardens. And the tents
                  themselves helped to shadow the walks. And next to these things was a temple
                  devoted to Venus, containing three couches, with a floor of agate and other most
                  beautiful stones, of every sort which the island afforded. And its walls and its
                  roof were made of cypress-wood, and its doors of ivory and citron-wood. And it was
                  furnished in the most exquisite manner with pictures and statues, and with goblets
                  and vases of every form and shape imaginable.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="42">
               <p>"And next to that was a drawing-room capable of containing five couches, with its
                  walls and doors made of boxwood, having a book-case in it, and along the roof a
                  clock, imitated from the dial at Achradina. And there was also a bath-room,
                  capable of containing three couches, having three brazen vessels for holding hot
                  water, and a bath containing five measures of water, beautifully variegated with
                  Tauromenian marble. And many rooms were also prepared for the marines, and for
                  those who looked to the pumps. And besides all this there were ten stalls for
                  horses on each side of the <pb n="v.1.p.331"/> walls; and by them the fodder for
                  the horses was kept, and the arms and furniture of the horsemen and of the boys.
                  There was also a cistern near the head of the ship, carefully shut, and containing
                  two thousand measures of water, made of beams closely compacted with pitch and
                  canvass. And next to the cistern there was a large Water-tight well for fish, made
                  so with beams of wood and lead. And it was kept full of sea-water, and great
                  numbers of fish were kept in it. And on each side of the walls there were also
                  projecting beams, placed at well-proportioned intervals; and to these were
                  attached stores of wood, and ovens, and baking places, and mills, and many other
                  useful offices. And all round the outside of the ship ran atlases six cubits high,
                  which supported the weight which was placed above them, and the triglyph, all
                  being placed at convenient distances from one another. And the whole ship was
                  adorned with suitable pictures.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="43">
               <p>"And in the vessel were eight towers of a size proportioned to the burden of the
                  ship, two at the stern, and as many at the head, and the rest in the middle of the
                  ship. And to each of these were fastened two large beams, or yards, from which
                  port-holes were fixed, through which stones were let down upon any enemy who might
                  come against the ship. And on each of the towers stood four young men fully armed,
                  and two archers. And the whole of the interior of the towers was full of stones
                  and darts. And a wall, having buttresses and decks, ran all through the ship,
                  supported on trestles; and on these decks was placed a catapult, which hurled a
                  stone weighing three talents, and an arrow twelve cubits long. And this engine was
                  devised and made by Archimedes; and it could throw every arrow a furlong. And
                  besides all this, there were mats composed of stout ropes<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">I have adopted here Casaubon's conjectural emendation, and his
                     interpretation of it. The text of the MSS. seems undoubtedly corrupt.</note>
                  suspended by brazen chains; and as there were three masts, from each of them were
                  suspended two large yard bearing stones, from which hooks and leaden weights were
                  let down upon any enemy which might attack the vessel. And there was also a
                  palisade all round the ship, made of iron, as a defence against those who might
                  attempt to board it; and iron ravens, as they were called, all round the ship,
                  which, being shot forth by engines, seized on the vessels of the enemy, and
                  brought <pb n="v.1.p.332"/> them round so as to expose them to blows. And on each
                  of the sides of the ship stood sixty young men clad in complete armour; and an
                  equal number stood on the masts, and on the yards which carried the stones; and
                  they were also on the masts, up at the mast-head, which was made of brass. On the
                  first there were three men, and on the second two, and on the third one. And they
                  had stones brought up to them in wicker baskets by means of pulleys, and arrows
                  were supplied to them by boys, within the defended parts of the mast-heads. And
                  the vessel had four wooden anchors and eight iron ones. And of the masts, the
                  second and third were easily found; but the first was procured with difficulty
                  among the mountains of the Bruttii, and was discovered by a swineherd. And
                  Phileas, a mechanic of Tauromenium, brought it down to the seaside. And the hold,
                  although of a most enormous depth, was pumped out by one man, by means of a
                  pulley, by an engine which was the contrivance of Archimedes. And the name of the
                  ship was 'The Syracusan;' but when Hiero sent it to sea, he altered its name and
                  called it 'The Alexandrian.'</p>
               <p>"And it had some small launches attached to it, the first of which was one of the
                  light galleys called cercurus, able to hold a weight of three thousand talents;
                  and it was wholly moved by oars. And after that came many galleys and skiffs of
                  about fifteen hundred talents burthen. And the crew also was proportionably
                  numerous; for besides the men who have been already mentioned, there were six
                  hundred more, whose post was at the head of the ship, always watching for the
                  orders of the captain. And there was a tribunal instituted to judge of all
                  offences which might be committed on board the ship, consisting of the captain and
                  the pilot, and the officer of the watch; and they decided in every case according
                  to the laws of the Syracusans.</p>

                  <quote>And they put on board the ship sixty thousand measures of corn, and ten
                     thousand jars of Sicilian salt-fish, and twenty thousand talents weight of
                     wool, and of other cargo twenty thousand talents weight also. And besides all
                     this, there were the provisions necessary for the crew. And Hiero, when he had
                     understood that there was no harbour in Sicily large enough to admit this ship,
                     and, moreover, that some of the harbours were dangerous for any vessel,
                     determined to <pb n="v.1.p.333"/> send it as a present to Alexandria to
                     Ptolemy the king of Egypt. For there was a great dearth of corn in Egypt. And
                     he did so; and the ship came to Alexandria, where it was put in port. And Hiero
                     honoured Archimelus, also, the epigrammatic poet, who wrote an epigram on the
                     ship, with a thousand bushels of wheat, which he also sent at his own expense
                     to the Piræus; and the epigram runs thus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  tell him that there is a speech which is attributed to <pb n="v.1.p.334"/> Lysias
                  the orator, written about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγγυθήκη,</foreign> which
                  begins with these words—<quote>If, O judges, Lysimanes had said anything
                     reasonable or moderate.</quote> And going on a little, he proceeds to
                     say—<quote>I should not have been eager to plead in an action about this chest
                        (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγγυθήκη</foreign>), which is not worth thirty
                     drachmæ.</quote> And presently he tells us that the chest was a brazen
                     one—<quote>But when I wished last year to repair it I gave it to a brazier; for
                     it is well put together, and has the faces of Satyrs and large heads of oxen
                     carved upon it. There is also another coffer of the same size; for the same
                     workman made many such articles of the same size, and alike in many
                     particulars.</quote> In these words Lysias, having said that the chest was made
                  of brass, shows plainly enough, as Callixenus also said, that they were things
                  that might be used as stands for kettles. For so Polemo Periegetes said, in the
                  third of those books of his which are addressed to Adæus and Antigonus, where he
                  explains the subject of the picture which is at Phlius, in the portico of the
                  polemarchs, painted by Sillax the Rhegian, who is mentioned by Epicharmus and
                  Simonides. And his words are—<quote>
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ʼἐγγυθήκη,</foreign> and a large goblet on it.</quote>
                  And Hegesander the Delphian, in his book entitled a Commentary on Statues and
                  Images, says that the pedestal dedicated by Glaucus the Chian at Delphi is like an
                  iron <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγγυθήκη,</foreign> the gift of Alyattes. And that is
                  mentioned by Herodotus, who calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποκρητηρίδιον</foreign> (a stand for a goblet). And Hegesander uses the same
                  expression. And we ourselves have seen that lying at Delphi, a thing really worth
                  looking at, on account of the figures of animals which are carved upon it, and of
                  other insects, and living things, and plants. . . . . . . . can be put upon it,
                  and goblets, and other furniture.</p>
               <p>But the thing which is called by the Alexandrians <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγγοθήκη</foreign> is a triangular vessel, hollow in the middle, capable of
                  receiving an earthen wine-jar inside of it. And poor men have this made of wood,
                  but rich men have it of brass or of silver.</p>

                  now go on to speak of those kings who are and have been fond of good cheer. For
                  the king, who is the namesake of the abovementioned Antiochus, and the son of
                  Demetrius, according to the account of Posidonius, used to entertain a great crowd
                  of people every day, and in addition to what they ate on the <pb n="v.1.p.335"/>
                  spot, he would give every one of the guests large heaps, consisting of entire
                  joints of meat of beasts, and birds, and fishes, undivided and ready dressed,
                  enough to fill a wagon. And besides all this, he gave them heaps of hone-cakes,
                  and of garlands, of myrrh, and frankincense, with large fillets and bandages of
                  golden embroidery as long as a man. And another king, Antiochus, when celebrating
                  the games at Daphne, himself also made very sumptuous entertainments, as
                  Posidonius himself relates; and he was the first person who ever made a
                  distribution among the guests of whole joints of meat; and also of geese, and
                  hares, and antelopes alive. And golden chaplets were also given to the guests, and
                  a great quantity of silver plate, and of slaves, and horses, and camels. And each
                  man was bound to get on the camel and drink a draught of wine, and then to accept
                  of the camel and of the boy who stood by it. <quote>And,</quote> says he,
                     <quote>all the natives and inhabitants of Syria, on account of the fertility of
                     the land, are accustomed to make frequent feasts after their necessary labours,
                     in order that they may rejoice together, using their gymnasia as baths, and
                     anointing themselves with expensive oil and perfumes; and at their grammatea
                     (for that is the name which they give to their public entertainments) living as
                     if in their own houses, and gratifying their stomachs the greater part of the
                     day with wine and meat, and also carrying away a quantity of the same to their
                     own homes, they thus spend the day, listening also to the music of the loud
                     lyre made of the tortoise shell, so that whole cities resound with noises of
                     this kind</quote>

               <p>And I, my friends, praise very much the entertainment which was given by Alexander

               <p>Diogenes the Epicurean, having a very tolerable acquaintance with the doctrines of
                  the sect which he professed, was by birth a native of Seleucia, in the district of
                  Babylon. And he was kindly received by the king, although the monarch rather
                  inclined to the doctrines of the Stoic school. <pb n="v.1.p.336"/> Accordingly,
                  Alexander treated him with great distinction, although a man of anything but a
                  reputable course of life, and so given to calumny and envy, that if he could raise
                  a laugh by it, he could not abstain from even the king himself. And when he
                  preferred to the king a request that had no great connexion with
                  philosophy—namely, that he might be allowed to wear a purple robe and a golden
                  crown, having a face of Virtue in the centre of it, as he claimed to be addressed
                  as the priest of Virtue, he agreed to it all, and besides that, made him a present
                  of the crown. And these ornaments Diogenes, being in love with a woman who was one
                  of the Bacchanalian singers, gave to her. But Alexander, hearing of this,
                  collected a banqueting party of philosophers and eminent men, and among them he
                  invited Diogenes. And when he arrived he begged him to take his seat with his
                  crown and his purple robe on. And when he replied that that would be unseemly, the
                  king nodded to his servants to introduce the musicians, among whom this singing
                  woman appeared, crowned with the crown of Virtue, and clothed also in the purple
                  robe. So when every one burst into laughter at this, the philosopher kept quiet,
                  and never stopped praising the singing woman.</p>
               <p>But Antiochus, who succeeded Alexander in the kingdom, could not tolerate the
                  abusive language of this Diogenes, and accordingly ordered him to be put to death.
                  But Alexander was at all times, and in all circumstances, of a gentle disposition,
                  and affable to every one in conversation, and not at all like Athenion the
                  Peripatetic philosopher, who had a philosophical school at Athens, and at Messene,
                  and also at Larissa in Thessaly, and who subsequently became tyrant of Athens;
                  concerning whom Posidonius of Apamea gives a very particular account, which I,
                  even though it is rather long, will quote, in order that we may come to a thorough
                  understanding and appreciation of those men who profess to be philosophers, and
                  that we may not be taken in by their ragged cloaks and unshaven chins. For, as
                  Agatho says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>"In the school of Erymneus the Peripatetic there was a certain man of the name of
                  Athenion, who applied himself <pb n="v.1.p.337"/> very perseveringly to
                  philosophical discussions. He, having bought an Egyptian female slave, made her
                  his mistress. And when she became a mother, either by him or by some one else, the
                  child was bred up by Athenion, and received the same name as his master. And
                  having been taught literature, he became accustomed to lead his master about when
                  he became an old man, in company with his mother; and when he died he succeeded
                  him as his heir, and became a citizen of Athens, being enrolled under the name of
                  Athenion. And having married a very beautiful girl, after that he betook himself
                  to the profession of a sophist, hunting out for boys to come to his school. And
                  having pursued his profession of sophist at Messene and at Larissa in Thessaly,
                  and having amassed a considerable fortune, he returned to Athens. And having been
                  appointed an ambassador by the Athenian people, when the chief power in all that
                  district was lodged in the hands of Mithridates, he insinuated himself into the
                  good graces of the king, and became one of his friends, being held by him in the
                  greatest honour; in consequence of which he wrote letters to the Athenians to
                  raise their spirits, as one who had the greatest influence with the king of
                  Cappadocia, leading them to hope that they should be discharged of all their
                  existing debts, and live in peace and concord with him; and also that they should
                  recover their democratic constitution, and receive great presents both publicly
                  and privately. And the Athenians boasted of all these promises which were made to
                  them, feeling sure that the supremacy of the Romans would be put an end to.</p>

               <p>"Now when all Asia had revolted to the King, Athenio set out to return to Athens;
                  and being tossed about by a storm he was driven to Carystus. And when the
                  Cecropidæ heard this, they sent some ships of war to conduct him back, and a
                  litter with silver feet. And now he is entering the city; and almost the whole of
                  the citizens has poured out to meet him; and many other spectators came together,
                  marvelling at this preposterous freak of fortune, that this intrusive citizen,
                  Athenion, foisted into Athens in such a manner, should be conducted into the city
                  on a litter with silver feet, and lying on purple clothes, a man who had never
                  before seen even purple patch on his ragged cloak; when no one, not even of the
                  Romans, had ever exhibited such pomp and insulting show <pb n="v.1.p.338"/> in
                  Attica before. So there ran to this spectacle men, women, children, all expecting
                  some glorious honours from Mithridates. While Athenio, that ancient beggar, who
                  gave lectures for trifling sums of money, was now making a procession through the
                  country and through the city, relying on the king's favour, and treating every one
                  with great insolence. There met him also the artisans of the spectacles of
                  Bacchus, calling him a messenger of the young Bacchus, and inviting him to the
                  common altar, and to the prayers and libations which were to be offered at it; and
                  he, who had formerly come out of a hired house, into the * * * * * was conducted
                  into a mansion adorned with couches, and pictures, and statues, and a display of
                  silver plate. And from it he issued forth, dragging on the ground a bright cloak,
                  and with a golden ring on his finger, having on it a carved portrait of
                  Mithridates. And numbers of attendants went before him and followed him in
                  procession. And in the plot of ground belonging to the artisans, sacrifices were
                  performed in honour of the return of Athenio, and libations made with formal
                  proclamation by a herald. And the next day many people came to his house and
                  awaited his appearance; and the whole Ceramicus was full of citizens and
                  foreigners, and there was a voluntary thronging of the whole population of the
                  city to the assembly. And at last he came forth, being attended by all who wished
                  to stand well with the people, as if they had been his bodyguards, every one
                  hastening even to touch his garment.</p>

                     on all the people in a circle, and then looking up, said, 'O men of Athens, the

                     what I know. But the greatness of the affairs that must be mentioned, owing to
                     the unexpected character which circumstances have assumed, hinders me from
                     doing so.' And when all the bystanders called out to him with one accord to be

                  The king Mithridates is master of Bithynia, and of Upper Cappadocia; and he is
                  master of the whole of Asia, without any break, as far as Pamphylia and Cilicia:
                  and the kings of the Armenians <pb n="v.1.p.339"/> and Persians are only his
                  guards; and he is lord of all the nations which dwell around the Palus Mæotis, and
                  the whole of Pontus, so that his dominions are upwards of thirty thousand furlongs
                  in circumference. And the Roman commander in Pamphylia, Quintus Oppius, has been
                  surrendered to him, and is following him as a prisoner, but Manius Aquillius, a
                  man of consular rank, who has celebrated a triumph for his victory over the
                  Sicilians, is fastened by a long chain to Bastarna, a man of gigantic stature, and
                  is dragged byhim on foot at the tail of his horse. And of the other Roman citizens
                  in Asia some have fallen down at the images of the gods, and the rest have put on
                  square cloaks and acknowledge again the claims of their original country. And
                  every city honouring him with more than human honours, galls the king a god; and
                  oracles everywhere promise him the dominion over the whole world, on which account
                  he is now sending large armies against Thrace and Macedonia, and every part of
                  Europe is coming over bodily to his side. For ambassadors are coming to him, not
                  only from the Italian tribes, but also from the Carthaginians, begging him to
                  enter into alliance with them for the destruction of the Romans.'</p>

               <p>"Having stopped a little after saying this, and having given time for the
                  multitude to converse together about the news thus unexpectedly announced to them,
                  he wiped his face, and went on, 'What then do I advise?—Not to bear this state of
                  anarchy any longer, which the Roman senate makes continue, while it is deciding
                  what constitution you are to enjoy for the future. And do not let us be
                  indifferent to our temples being closed, to our gymnasia being left in the dirt,
                  to our theatre being always empty, and our courts of justice mute, and the Pnyx,
                  consecrated by the oracles of the gods, being taken from the people. Let us not, O
                  Athenians, be indifferent to the sacred voice of Bacchus being reduced to silence,
                  to the holy temple of Castor and Pollux being closed, and to the schools of the
                  philosophers being silence as they are.' And when this slave had said all this and
                  a good deal more, the multitude conversing with one another and running together
                  to the theatre elected Athenio general over the entire army. And then, the
                  Peripatetic coming into the orchestra, walking like Pythocles, thanked the
                  Athenians, and said, 'Now you yourselves are your own generals; and I am <pb n="v.1.p.340"/> the commander-in-chief: and if you exert all your strength to
                  co-operate with me I shall be able to do as much as all of you put together.' And

               <p>"And a few days afterwards, the philosopher having thus appointed himself tyrant,
                  and having proved how much weight is to be attached to the doctrine of the
                  Pythagoreans about plots against others, and what was the practical effect of the
                  philosophy which the admirable Pythagoras laid down, as Theopompus has related in
                  the eighth book of his Philippics, and Hermippus, the Callimachean, has
                  corroborated the account, he immediately removed all the citizens who were
                  right-thinking and of a good disposition (contrary to the sentiments of, and rules
                  laid down by, Aristotle and Theophrastus; showing how true is the proverb which
                  says, Do not put a sword into the hand of a child); and he placed sentinels at the
                  gates, so that many of the Athenians, fearing what he might be going to do, let
                  themselves down over the walls by night, and so fled away. And Athenio sending
                  some horsemen to pursue them slew some of them, and brought back some in chains,
                  having a number of bodyguards about his person of the kind called phractici. And
                  often he convened assemblies, pretending great attachment to the side of the
                  Romans; and bringing accusations against many as having kept up communications
                  with the exiles, and aiming at a revolution, he put them to death. And he placed
                  thirty guards at each gate, and would not allow any one to go either in or out.
                  And he seized on the property of many of the people, and collected such a quantity
                  of money as to fill several wells; and he also sent all over the country people to
                  lie in wait, as it were, for every one who was travelling, and they brought them
                  to him; and he put them to death without any trial, torturing and racking them
                  into the bargain. And he also instituted prosecutions for treason against several
                  people, saying that they were co-operating with the exiles to effect their return.
                  And some of the parties prosecuted fled out of fear before the trials came on, and
                  some were condemned before the tribunals, he himself giving his own vote and
                  collecting those of the others. And he brought about in the city a scarcity of the
                  things necessary for life, <pb n="v.1.p.341"/> stinting the citizens of their
                  proper quantity of barley and wheat. He also sent out heavy-armed soldiers over
                  the country, to hunt out any of those who had fled and who could be found within
                  the borders of the land, or any of the Athenians who were escaping beyond the
                  borders. And whoever was detected he beat to death; and some of them he exhausted
                  beforehand with tortures; and he caused proclamation to be made, that all must be
                  in their houses by sunset, and that no one should presume to walk abroad with a

               <p>"And he not only plundered the property of the citizens, but that of foreigners
                  also, laying his hands even on the property of the god which was laid up at Delos;
                  sending Apellicon into the island, who was a Scian by birth, but who had become a
                  citizen of Athens, and who lived a most whimsical and ever-changing course of
                  life. For at one time he was a philosopher, and collected all the treatises of the
                  Peripatetics, and the whole library of Aristotle, and many others; for he was a
                  very rich man; and he had also stolen a great many autograph decrees of the
                  ancients out of the temple of the Mighty Mother, and whatever else there was
                  ancient and taken care of in other cities; and being detected in these practices
                  at Athens he would have been in great danger if he had not made his escape; and a
                  short time afterwards he returned again, having paid his court to many people, and
                  he then joined himself to Athenion, as being a man of the same sect as he was. And
                  Athenion, having embraced the doctrines of the Peripatetics, measured out a chœnix
                  of barley, as four days' allowance for the ignorant Athenians, giving them what
                  was barely food enough for fowl, and not the proper nutriment for men. And
                  Apellicon, coming in great force to Delos, and living there more like a man
                  exhibiting a spectacle than a general with soldiers, and placing guards in a very
                  careless manner on the side of Delos, and leaving all the back of the island
                  unguarded, and not even putting down a palisade in front of his camp, went to
                  rest. And Orobius, the Roman general, hearing of this, who was at that time in
                  command at Delos, watching for a moonless night, led out his troops, and falling
                  on Apellicon and his soldiers, who were all asleep and drunk, he cut the Athenians
                  and all those who were in the army with them to pieces, like so many sheep, to the
                  number of six hundred, and he took <pb n="v.1.p.342"/> four hundred alive. And
                  that fine general, Apellicon, fled away without being perceived, and came to
                  Delos; and Orobius seeing that many of those who fled with him had escaped to the
                  farmhouses round about, burnt them in the houses, houses and all; and he destroyed
                  by fire also all the engines for besieging cities, together with the Helepolis
                  which Apellicon had made when he came to Delos. And Orobius having erected in that
                  place a trophy and an altar, wrote this inscription on it— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>This tomb contains the foreigners here slain,</l>

                  property willingly.</p>

               <p>These are the commanders who became such from having been philosophers; concerning
                  whom Demochares said,—<quote>Just as no one could make a spear out of a bulrush,
                     so no one could make a faultless general out of Socrates.</quote> For Plato
                  says that Socrates served in three military expeditions, one to Potidæa, and
                  another to Amphipolis, and another against the Bœotians, in which last it was that
                  the battle of Delium took place. And though no one has mentioned this
                  circumstance, he himself says that he gained the prize of the most eminent valour,
                  since all the other Athenians fled, and many were slain. But all this is an
                  erroneous statement. For the expedition against Amphipolis took place in the
                  archonship of Alcæus, when Cleon was the general; and it <pb n="v.1.p.343"/> was
                  composed entirely of picked men, as Thucydides relates. Socrates then, a man who
                  had nothing but his ragged cloak and his stick, must have been one of these picked
                  men. But what historian or poet has mentioned this fact? Or where has Thucydides
                  made the slightest mention of Socrates, this soldier of Plato's? And what is there
                  in common between a shield and a philosopher's staff? And when was it that
                  Socrates bore a part in the expedition against Potidoea, as Plato has said in his
                  Charmides, where he states that he then yielded the prize of preeminent valour to
                  Alcibiades? though Thucydides has not mentioned it, nor has Isocrates in his
                  Oration on the Pair-horse Chariot. And what battle ever took place when Socrates
                  gained the prize of preeminent valour? And what eminent and notorious exploit did
                  he perform; for indeed there was actually no battle at all at that time, as
                  Thucydides tells us.</p>
               <p>But Plato not being content with all these strange stories, introduces the valour
                  which was displayed, or rather which was invented by him at Delium. For if
                  Socrates had even taken Delium, as Herodicus the Cratetian has reported in his
                  Treatise to Philosocrates, he would have fled disgracefully as all the rest did,
                  when Pagondas sent two squadrons of cavalry unperceived round the hill. For then
                  some of the Athenians fled to Delium, and some fled to the sea, and some to
                  Oropus, and some to Mount Parnes. And the Bœotians, especially with their cavalry,
                  pursued them and slew them; and the Locrian cavalry joined in the pursuit and
                  slaughter. When then this disorder and alarm had seized upon the Athenians, did
                  Socrates alone, looking proud and casting his eyes around, stand firm, turning
                  aside the onset of the Bœotian and Locrian cavalry? And yet does Thucydides make
                  no mention of this valour of his, nor even any poet either. And how was it that he
                  yielded to Alcibiades the prize of preeminent valour, who had absolutely never
                  joined in this expedition at all? But in the Crito, Plato, that favourite of
                  Memory, says that Socrates had never once gone out of Attica, except when he, once
                  went to the Isthmian games. And Antisthenes, the Socratic philosopher, tells the
                  same tale as Plato about the Aristeia; but the story is not true. For this Dog
                  flatters Socrates in many particulars, on which account we must not believe either
                  of them, keeping Thucydides for our guide. For Antisthenes <pb n="v.1.p.344"/>
                  even exaggerates this false story, saying,—<quote>'But we hear that you also
                     received the prize of preeminent valour in the battle which took place against
                     the Bœotians.' 'Be quiet, my friend, the prize belongs to Alcibiades, not to
                     me.' 'Yes, but you gave it to him as we are told.'</quote> But Plato's Socrates
                  says that he was present at Potidæa, and that he yielded the prize of preeminent
                  valour to Alcibiades on that occasion. But by the universal consent of all
                  historians the expedition against Potidæa, in which Phormio commanded, was
                  previous to the one against Delium.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="56">
               <p>In every respect then the philosophers tell lies; and they are not aware that they
                  commit numbers of anachronisms in the accounts which they give. And even the
                  admirable Xenophon is not free from this error. For he in his Banquet introduces
                  Callias, the son of Hipponicus, as the lover of Autolycus, the son of Lycon, and
                  making an entertainment in his honour when he gained the victory in the
                  Pancratium. And he represents himself as being present with the rest of the
                  guests, when he perhaps was either not born, or at all events not out of
                  childhood. And this is the time when Aristion was archon. For it was in his
                  archonship that Eupolis exhibited the comedy Autolycus, in which, in the character
                  of Demostratus, he ridicules the victory of Autolycus. And again Xenophon makes
                  Socrates say at this Banquet—<quote>And Pausanias, indeed, the lover of Agathon
                     the poet, when speaking in excuse of those who allow themselves to indulge in
                     intemperance, said that a most valiant army might be composed of boys and their
                     lovers; for that of all the men in the world they would be the most ashamed to
                     desert one another. Saying a very strange thing,—if men who are accustomed
                     utterly to disregard all blame, and to behave with utter shamelessness to one
                     another, would be the men above all others ashamed to do anything
                     disgraceful.</quote> But that Pausanias never said anything of the sort we may
                  see from the Banquet of Plato. For I know of no book at all which is written by
                  Pausanias. Nor is he introduced by any one else as speaking of lovers and boys,
                  but only by Plato. But whether Xenophon has absolutely invented this story, or
                  whether he fell in with any edition of Plato's Banquet which reports what happened
                  in a different manner, is of no importance; still we must take notice of the
                  blunder as far as the <pb n="v.1.p.345"/> time is concerned. Aristion, in whose
                  time this banquet is represented as having taken place, was archon four years
                  before Euphemus, in whose archonship Plato places the banquet given in honour of
                  the victory of Agathon, at which banquet Pausanias said these things about lovers.
                  So that it is a marvellous and incredible thing that Socrates w hen supping with
                  Callias should find fault with things as having been said erroneously, which had
                  not yet been said at all, and which were not said till four years afterwards at
                  the banquet of Agathon.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="57">
               <p>But altogether Plato's Banquet is mere nonsense. For when Agathon got the victory
                  Plato was fourteen years old. For the former was crowned at the Lenæa in the
                  archonship of Euphemus. But Plato was born in the year of the archonship of
                  Apollodorus, who succeeded Euthydemus. And when he was eighty-two years old he
                  died in the archonship of Theophilus, who succeeded Callimachus; for he is the
                  eighty-second archon after Apollodorus. But from the archonship of Apollodorus and
                  the birth of Plato, Euphemus is the fourteenth archon; and it is in his archonship
                  that the banquet was given in honour of the victory of Agathon. And Plato himself
                  shows that this entertainment had taken place a long time before, saying in the
                  Banquet . . . . <quote>'Do you think then that this entertainment has taken place
                     but lately, so that I could have been present at it?' 'Indeed I do,' said he.
                     'How could that be,' said I, 'O Glaucon? Do you not know that Agathon has not
                     been in the city for many years?'</quote> And then a little while after he
                     says—<quote>' But tell me, when did this entertainment take place?' And I
                     replied, 'When we were still children, when Agathon gained the prize in
                     tragedy.</quote> ' But that Plato makes many blunders in his chronology is
                  plain from many circumstance. For as the poet said—<quote>The man has a tongue
                     which pays no regard to seasons;</quote> so he writes without sufficient
                  discernment. For he never spoke at random, but always with great
                  consideration.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="58">
               <p>As for instance, writing in the Gorgias, he says— <quote>'Archelaus, then,
                     according to your definition, is a miserable man.' 'Yes, my friend, if, at
                     least, he is an unjust one.'</quote> And then, after expressly stating that
                  Archelaus was possessed of the kingdom of the Macedonians, he goes on to say, <pb n="v.1.p.346"/>
                  <quote>that Pericles also was lately dead</quote> But if Pericles had only lately
                  died, Archelaus was not yet in the enjoyment of his dominions at all; and if
                  Archelaus was king at the time, then Pericles had been dead a long time. Now
                  Perdiccas was king before Archelaus, according to the statement of Nicomedes of
                  Acanthus; and he reigned forty-one years. But Theopompus says he reigned
                  thirty-five years; Anaximenes, forty; Hieronymus, twenty-eight. But Marsyas and
                  Philochorus say that he reigned only twenty-three years. Now, as these all vary so
                  much in their accounts, we will take the smallest number, and say twenty-three.
                  But Pericles died in the third year of the Peloponnesian war, in the archonship of
                  Epameinon, in which year also Alexander died, and Perdiccas succeeded him in the
                  kingdom. And he reigned till the archonship of Callias, in whose year Perdiccas
                  died, and Archelaus succeeded to the kingdom. How, then, can Pericles have died
                  lately, as Plato phrases it? And in the same Gorgias Plato represents Socrates as
                  saying— <quote>And last year, when I drew the lot to be one of the council, when
                     my tribe was the presiding tribe, and I had to put the question to the vote, I
                     caused the people to laugh, as I did not know how to put the question to the
                     vote.</quote> Now Socrates did not fall into this error out of ignorance, but
                  out of his firm principles of virtue; for he did not choose to violate the laws of
                  the democracy. And Xenophon shows this plainly in the first book of his Hellenics,
                  where he gives the following account:—<quote>But when some of the prytanes said
                     that they would not put the question contrary to the laws, Callixenus again
                     mounts the tribunal and inveighs against them; and they cried out that he
                     should impeach those who refused. And the prytanes being alarmed, all agreed to
                     put the question except Socrates the son of Sophroniscus; and he said that he
                     would not, but that he would do everything according to the laws.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>This was the question which was put to the vote against the generals, Erasinides
                  and his colleagues, because they did not pick up the men who were lost in the
                  naval battle at Arginusæ. And this battle took place in the archonship of Callias,
                  twenty-four years after the death of Pericles.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="59">
               <p>But the dialogue in the Protagoras, which took place after the death of
                  Hipponicus, when Callias had entered upon <pb n="v.1.p.347"/> his patrimonial
                  inheritance, says that Protagoras had arrived in Athens for the second time not
                  many days previously. But Hipponicus, in the archonship of Euthydenmus, was a
                  colleague of Nicias in the generalship against the Tanagreans and against those
                  Bœotians who acted as their allies; and he defeated them in a battle. And he died
                  before Eupolis exhibited the Flatterers, which took place in the archonship of
                  Alcæus, but probably not any long time before. For the play proves that the
                  succession of Callias to his patrimonial inheritance was still quite recent. Now
                  in this play Eupolis introduces Protagoras as living at Athens. And Ameipsias, in
                  his Connus, which was exhibited two years before, does not enumerate him among the
                  band of sophists. So it is plain that this happened in the interval between those
                  two periods. But Plato represents Hippias the Elian also, in the Protagoras, as
                  present with some of his own fellow-citizens, men who it is not likely could have
                  remained long in Athens with safety, before the truce for a year was made in the
                  archonship of Isarchus, in the month Elaphebolion. But he represents this dialogue
                  as having taken place, not about the time when the truce had recently been made,
                  but a long time after that; at all events he says—<quote>For if they were savage
                     men, such as Pherecrates the poet exhibited last year at the Lenæan
                     festival.</quote> But the play of The Savage Men was exhibited in the
                  archonship of Aristion, who was succeeded as archon by Astyphilus, (being the
                  fifth after Isarchus,) in whose archonship the truce was made; for Isarchus came
                  first, then Ameinias, then Aristion, then Astyphilus: so that it is contrary to
                  history that Plato in his dialogue brings to Athens Hippias and his companions,
                  who were enemies at the time, when this truce had not yet any existence.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="60">
               <p>And among other things Plato says that Chærephon asked the Pythian priestess
                  whether any one was wiser than Socrates? and that she replied, No one. But Xenphon
                  does not agree with all this; but says—<quote>For when Dhærephon once asked at
                     Delphi about me, Apollo replied, in the presence of many witnesses, that no man
                     was either more just or more temperate than I was.</quote> And how can it be
                  either reasonable or probable that Socrates, who confessed that he knew nothing,
                  should allege that he had been called the wisest of all men by God who knows
                  everything? For if knowing <pb n="v.1.p.348"/> nothing be wisdom, then to know
                  everything must be folly. And what was the need of Chaerephon bothering the god,
                  and asking him about Socrates? for he himself might have been believed in his own
                  case, saying that he was not wise. For he must be a stupid man who would put such
                  a question to the god, as if he were to ask him such a question as this, Whether
                  any wool is softer than the Attic wool; or, Whether there are any more powerful
                  nations than the Bactrians and the Medes; or, Whether any one has a more complete
                  pug-nose than Socrates. For people who ask such questions as these have a very
                  neat slap in the face given them by the god, as when a man asked him (whether it
                  is a fable of Aesop's or of some one else), <quote rend="blockquote">

                  divulged with boisterous laughter by Aristophanes, as he was present at the
                  banquet according to Plato's account; for Aristophanes would never have suppressed

                  for him by Alcibiades. And indeed, he laments without ceasing, being, as I
                  suppose, unsuccessful in his love. For Aspasia, seeing in what a condition he was,
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And that he really did love Alcibiades Plato shows plainly in the
                  Protagoras, although he was now little less than thirty years of age; for he
                  speaks in this manner, <quote>'Whence are you come from, O Socrates? It seems to
                     me you are come from your pursuit of Alcibiades's beauty. And, indeed, the man,
                     when I saw him the other day, appeared to me to be a handsome man; a man,
                     indeed, O Socrates, as he may well be called, just as much so as we are; and he
                     has a firmly grown beard.' ' Well, what of that? are not you an admirer of
                     Homer, who said that the most beautiful season of life was that of a young man
                     who began to have a beard? And that is just the age of which Alcibiades is

               <p>But most philosophers are of such a disposition that they are more inclined to
                  evil speaking than the Comic writers. Since both Aeschines, the pupil of Socrates,
                  in his Telauges, attacks Critobulus the son of Crito. as an ignorant man, and one
                  who lives in a sordid manner; and he attacks Telauges himself for wearing a cloak
                  borrowed of a clothes' cleaner by the day for half an obol; and for being girt
                  about with a skin, and for having his sandals fastened with rotten pieces of
                  string. And as for Lysias the orator he laughs immoderately at him; and in his
                  Aspasia, he calls Hipponicus, the son of Callias, a blockhead; and taking all the
                  women of Ionia in a lump he calls them lascivious and covetous. But his Callias
                  dwells upon the quarrel of Callias with his own father, and the absurd jokes of
                  the sophist Prodicus and <pb n="v.1.p.350"/> Anaxagoras. For he says that
                  Prodicus had Theramenes for a pupil to finish his education; and that the other
                  had Philoxenus, the son of Eryxis, and Ariphrades, the brother of Arignotus, the
                  harp-player, wishing from the notorious impurity of life of the men who have been
                  named and their general want of respectability and intemperance to leave the sort
                  of education they received from their tutors to be inferred. But in his Axiochus
                  he runs Alcibiades down with great bitterness, as a drunkard, and a man always
                  running after other men's wives.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="63">
               <p>But Antisthenes, in the second of his treatises called Cyrus, abusing Alcibiades,
                  says that he is a breaker of the laws, both with respect to women and with respect
                  to every other part of his conduct in life; for he says that he had intrigued with
                  a mother, and daughter, and sister, after the fashion of the Persians. And his
                  Political Dialogue runs down the whole of the Athenian demagogues: and his
                  Archelaus attacks Gorgias, the rhetorician; and his Aspasia attacks Xanthippus and
                  Paralus, the sons of Pericles. For, as for one of them, he says that he is a
                  companion of Archestratus, who is no better than a frequenter of houses of the
                  worst possible fame; and the other he calls an acquaintance and intimate friend of
                  Euphemus, who abused every one he met with vulgar and ill-mannered abuse. And
                  nicknaming Plato Satho, in a witless and vulgar manner, he published a dialogue
                  against him, to which he gave the same name as its title.</p>
               <p>For these men believe that there is no such thing as an honest counsellor, or a
                  conscientious general, or a respectable sophist, or a poet worth listening to, or
                  a reasonable people: but Socrates, who spent his time in loose houses with the
                  flute-playing women of Aspasia, and who was always chatting with Piston the
                  armourer, and who gave lessons to Theodote the courtesan, how she ought to make
                  the most of her lovers, as Xenophon tells us in the second book of his
                  Memorabilia, is the only wise man according to them; for they represent him as
                  giving Theodote such rules as neither Nico the Samian, nor Callistrate the
                  Lesbian, nor Philænis the Leucadian, nor even Pythonicus the Athenian, were ever
                  acquainted with as charms to conciliate affection. And yet those people paid much
                  attention to such things. And time would fail me if I were to be inclined to quote
                  the attacks which philosophers <pb n="v.1.p.351"/> have made on people; for, as
                  the same Plato says, a regular crowd of Gorgons and Pegasi, and other monsters,
                  keeps flowing in upon me in immense numbers, and of preposterous appearance, so

               <p>When Masurius had said this, and when all had admired his wisdom, after silence
                  was restored Ulpian said,— You seem to me, O guests, to be overwhelmed with

                     <l>And sleeps as if he'd drunk medicinal poppy;</l>
                  </quote> as says Parmeno the Byzantian. Have you been all turned into stone by the
                  before-mentioned Gorgons? Concerning whom, that there really have been some
                  animals who were the causes of men being turned into stone, Alexander the Myndian
                  speaks at length, in the second book of his History of Beasts, saying—<quote>The
                     Nomades in Libya (where it is born) call the animal named the Gorgon, 'The
                     Looking-down:' and it is as most people say, conjecturing from its skin,
                     something like a wild sheep; but as some say, it is like a calf. And they say
                     that it has such a breath that it destroys every one who meets it; and that it
                     has a mane let down from its forehead over its eyes, and when it has shaken it
                     aside, which it does with difficulty by reason of it weight, and then looks out
                     through it, it slays the man who is beheld by it, not by its breath, but by
                     some natural violence which proceeds from its eyes. And it was discovered in
                     this way: Some of the soldiers of Marius, in his expedition against Jugurtha,
                     having beheld the Gorgon, thought because it held its head down, and moved
                     slowly, that it was a wild sheep, and in consequence they rushed upon it,
                     intending to kill it with the swords which they had about them; but it, being
                     disturbed, shaking aside the mane which hung down over its eyes, immediately
                     caused the death of those who were rushing upon it. And when others again and
                     again did the same thing, and lost their lives by so doing, and when all ho
                     proceeded against it were invariably killed, some of the soldiers inquired the
                     nature of the animal from the natives; and by the command of Marius some Nomad
                     horsemen laid an <pb n="v.1.p.352"/> ambush against it from a distance, and
                     shot it with darts, and returned to the camp, bringing the dead monster to the
                     general.</quote> And that this account is the true one, the skin and the
                  expedition of Marius both prove. But the statement made by the historian is not
                  credible, namely, that there are in Libya some oxen which are called
                     Opisthonomi,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎ὄπισθε,</foreign> behind; <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέμω,</foreign> to feed.</note> because they do not advance while feeding,
                  but feed constantly returning backwards, for their horns are a hindrance to their
                  feeding in the natural manner, inasmuch as they are not bent upwards, as is the
                  case with all other animals, but they bend downwards and overshadow the eyes; for
                  this is incredible, since no other historian testifies to such a circumstance.</p>

               <p>When Ulpian had said this, Laurentius bearing witness to the truth of his
                  statement, and adding something to his speech, said, that Marius sent the skins of
                  these animals to Rome, and that no one could conjecture to what animal they
                  belonged, on account of the singular appearance which they presented; and that
                  these skins were hung up in the temple of Hercules, in which the generals who

                     <l>He's hurt his leg; and so had Philoctetes.</l>
                     <l>Is he unfortunate in his old age?</l>
                     <l>Œneus was more so. So that every one,</l>

               <p>Then came into us these servants, bringing a great quantity of sea fish and lake
                  fish on silver platters, so that we marvelled at the wealth displayed, and at the
                  costliness of the entertainment, which was such that he seemed almost to have
                  engaged the Nereids themselves as the purveyors. And one of the parasites and
                  flatterers said that Neptune was sending fish to our Neptunian port, not by the
                  agency of those who at Rome sell rare fish for their weight in money; but that
                  some were imported from Antium, and some from Terracina, and some from the Pontian
                  islands opposite, and some from Pyrgi; and that is a city of Etruria. For the
                  fishmongers in Rome are very little different from those who used to be turned
                  into ridicule by the comic poets at Athens, of whom Antiphanes says, in his Young

                  used to perform their duties with vessels made of earthenware, as my countryman
                  Juba declares. But when the Romans altered the way of living, giving it a more
                  expensive direction, then Cleopatra, arranging her style of living in imitation of
                  them, she, I mean, who ultimately destroyed the Egyptian monarchy, not being able
                  to alter the name, she called gold and silver plate <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέραμον</foreign>; and then she gave the guests what she called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέραμα</foreign> to carry away with them; and this was very
                  costly. And on the Rosic earthenware, which was the most beautiful, Cleopatra
                  spent five mine every day. But Ptolemy the king, in the eighth book of his
                  commentaries, writing of Masinissa the king of the Libyans, speaks as follows—"His
                  entertainments were arranged in the Roman fashion, everything being served up in
                  silver <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέραμον.</foreign> And the second course he arranged
                  in the Italian mode. His dishes were all made of gold; made after the fashion of
                  those which are plaited of bulrushes or ropes. And he employed Greek
                  musicians.</p>

                  exceedingly scarce among the Greeks; and there was not indeed much silver; at
                  least, not much which was extracted from the mines; on which account Duris the
                  Samian says that Philip, the father of the great king Alexander, as he was
                  possessed of one flagon of gold, always put it under his pillow when he went to
                  bed. And Herodorus of Heraclea says, that the Golden Lamb of Atreus, which was the
                  pregnant cause of many eclipses of the sun, and changes of kings, and which was,
                  moreover, the subject of a great many tragedies, was a golden flagon, having in
                  the centre a figure of a golden lamb. And Anaximenes of Lampsacus, in the first of
                  those works of his, called Histories, says that the necklace of Eriphyle was so
                  notorious because gold at that time was so rare among the Greeks; for that a
                  golden goblet was at that time a most unusual thing to see; but that after the
                  taking of Delphi by the Phocians, then all such things began to be more abundant.
                  But formerly even those men who were accounted exceedingly rich used to drink out
                  of brazen goblets, and the repositories where they put them away they called
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκόθηκαι.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>And Herodotus says that the Egyptian priests drink out of brazen goblets; and he
                  affirms that silver flagons could not be found to be given to all the kings, even
                  when they sacrificed in public; and, accordingly, that Psammetichus, who was later
                  than the other kings, performed his libations with a brazen flagon, while the rest
                  made their offerings with silver ones. But after the temple at Delphi had been
                  plundered by the tyrants of Phocis, then gold became common among the Greeks, and
                  silver became actually abundant; and afterwards, when the great Alexander had
                  brought into Greece all the treasures from out of Asia, then there really did

               <p>And the silver and gold offerings which were at Delphi were offered originally by
                  Gyges the king of the Lydians. For before the reign of this monarch Apollo had no
                  silver, <pb n="v.1.p.366"/> and still less had he gold, as Phanias the Eresian
                  tells us, and Theopompus, too, in the fortieth book of his History of the
                  Transactions of the Reign of Philip. For these writers relate that the Pythian
                  temple was adorned by Gyges, and by Crœsus who succeeded him; and after them by
                  Gelo and Hiero, the tyrants of Syracuse: the first of whom offered up a tripod and
                  a statue of Victory, both made of gold, about the time that Xerxes was making his
                  expedition against Greece; and Hiero made similar offerings. And Theopompus uses
                  the following language—<quote>For anciently the temple was adorned with brazen
                     offerings: I do not mean statues, but caldrons and tripods made of brass. The
                     Lacedæmonians, therefore, wishing to gild the face of the Apollo that was at
                     Amyclæ, and not finding any gold in Greece, having sent to the oracle of the
                     god, asked the god from whom they could buy gold; and he answered them that
                     they should go to Crœsus the Lydian, and buy it of him. And they went and
                     bought the gold of Crœsus. But Hiero the Syracusan, wishing to offer to the god
                     a tripod and a statue of Victory of unalloyed gold, and being in want of the
                     gold for a long time, afterwards sent men to Greece to seek for it; who, coming
                     after a time to Corinth, and tracing it out, found some in the possession of
                     Architeles the Corinthian, who had been a long time buying it up by little and
                     little, and so had no inconsiderable quantity of it; and he sold it to the
                     emissaries of Hiero in what quantity they required. And after that, having
                     filled his hand with it he made them a present of all that he could hold in his
                     hand, in return for which Hiero sent a vessel full of corn, and many other
                     gifts to him from Sicily.</quote>

                  those states which were in good order. But Zeno the Stoic, thinking everything
                  unimportant except the legitimate and honest use of the precious metals, <pb n="v.1.p.368"/> forbad either praying for or deprecating them; but still he
                  recommended chiefly the use of those which were more commonly accessible and less
                  superfluous; in order that men, having the dispositions of their minds formed so
                  as neither to fear nor to admire anything which is not honourable on the one hand
                  or discreditable on the other, should use only what is natural as much as
                  possible, and yet should not fear what is of an opposite character, but abstain
                  from such in obedience to reason and not to fear. For nature has not banished any
                  of the above-mentioned things out of the world, but has made subterranean veins of
                  these metals, the working of which is very laborious and difficult, in order that
                  they who desire such things may arrive at the acquisition after toil and
                  suffering; and that not only those men themselves who work in the mines, but those
                  also who collect what has been extracted from the mines, may acquire this much
                  wished for opulence at the expense of countless labours.</p>
               <p>Therefore a little of these metals lies on the surface just to serve as a sample
                  of the rest which is beneath, since in the remotest corners of the earth also
                  there are rivers bearing down gold-dust in their waters; and women and men
                  destitute of bodily strength scratching among the sand, detach these particles
                  from the sand, and then they wash them and bring them to the smelting-pot, as my
                  countryman Posidonius says is done among the Helvetians, and among others of the
                  Celtic tribes. And the mountains which used formerly to be called the Rhipeean
                  mountains, and which were subsequently named the Olbian (as if happy), and which
                  are now called the Alps, (they are mountains in Gaul,) when once the woods upon
                  them had caught fire spontaneously, ran with liquid silver. The greater quantity
                  of this metal, however, is found by mining operations carried on at a great depth,
                  and attended by great hardship, according to the statement of Demetrius Phalereus,
                  in consequence of the desire of avarice to draw Pluto himself out of the recesses
                  of the earth; and, accordingly, he says facetiously that—<quote>Men having often
                     abandoned what was visible for the sake of what was uncertain, have not got
                     what they expected, and have lost what they had, being unfortunate by an
                     enigmatical sort of calamity.</quote>

               <p>But the Lacedæmonians being hindered by their national institutions from
                  introducing silver or gold into Sparta, as the <pb n="v.1.p.369"/> same
                  Posidonius relates, or from possessing any in private, did possess it
                  nevertheless, but then they deposited it among their neighbours the Arcadians. But
                  subsequently the Arcadians became enemies to them instead of friends, as they had
                  been; picking a quarrel with them with the express view of seizing on this deposit
                  without being called to account for it, by reason of the enmity now subsisting.
                  Therefore it is said that the gold and silver which had formerly been at Lacedæmon
                  was consecrated at Delphi to Apollo; and that when Lysander brought gold publicly
                  into the city he was the cause of many evils to the state by so doing. And it is
                  said that Gylippus, who delivered the Syracusans, was put to death by starvation,
                  having been condemned by the Ephori, because he had embezzled some of the money
                  sent to Sparta by Lysander. But that which had been devoted to the god and been
                  granted to the people as a public ornament and public property, it was not decent
                  for any mortal to treat with contempt.</p>

               <p>But that tribe of Gauls which is called the Cordistæ, does not introduce gold into

                  of their neighbours, and to commit injustice; and that nation is a remnant of the
                  Gauls who formed the army of Brennus when he made his expedition against the
                  temple of Delphi. And a certain Bathanatius, acting as their leader, settled them
                  as a colony in the districts around the Ister, from whom they call the road by
                  which they returned the Bathanatian road, and even to this day they call his
                  posterity the Bathanati. And these men proscribe gold, and do not introduce it
                  into their territories, as a thing on account of which they have suffered many
                  calamities; but they do use silver, and for the sake of that they commit the most
                  enormous atrocities. Although the proper course would be, not to banish the whole
                  class of the thing of which they were formerly plundered, but the impiety which
                  could perpetrate such a sacrilege. And even if they did not introduce silver into
                  their country, still they would commit excesses in the pursuit of copper and iron;
                  and even if they had not these things, still they would continue to rage in war
                  against other nations for the sake of meat and drink, and other necessaries.</p>

               <p>When Pontianus had delivered his opinion in these <pb n="v.1.p.370"/> terms, and
                  while most of the guests were endeavouring to solve the questions proposed by
                  Ulpian, Plutarch, being one of those who was attending to the other subjects of
                  discussion, said,—The name parasite was in former days a respectable and a holy
                  name. At all events, Polemo (whether he was a Samian or a Sicyonian, or whether he
                  prefers the name of an Athenian, which Heraclides the Mopseatian gives him, who
                  also speaks of him as being claimed by other cities; and he was also called
                  Stelocopas, as Herodicus the Cratetian has told us,) writing about parasites,
                  speaks as follows—<quote>The name of parasite is now a disreputable one; but among
                     the ancients we find the word parasite used as something sacred, and nearly
                     equivalent to the title Messmate. Accordingly, at Cynosarges, in the temple of
                     Hercules, there is a pillar on which is engraven a decree of Alcibiades; the
                     clerk who drew it up being Stephanus the son of Thucydides; and in it mention
                     is made of this name in the following terms—' Let the priest perform the
                     monthly sacrifices with the parasites; and let the parasites select one
                     bastard, and one of the sons of the same, according to the usual national
                     customs; and whoever is unwilling to take the place of a parasite, let the
                     priest report him to the tribunal.' And in the tables of the laws concerning
                     the Deliastæ it is written—' And let two heralds, of the family of the heralds,
                     of that branch of it which is occupied about the sacred mysteries, be chosen;
                     and let them be parasites in the temple of Delos for a year.' And in Pallenis
                     this inscription is engraved on the offerings there found—' The Archons and
                     parasites made these offerings, who, in the archonship of Pythodorus, were
                     crowned with a golden crown;<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The text
                        is supposed to be corrupt here.</note> and the parasites were, in the
                     archonship of Lycostratus, Gargettius; in the archonship of Pericletus,
                     Pericles Pitheus; in that of Demochares, Charinus.' And in the laws of the
                     king, we find the following words—' That the parasites of the Acharnensians
                     shall sacrifice to Apollo.' But Clearchus the Solensian, and he was one of the
                     disciples of Aristotle, in the first book of his Lives, writes thus-'But now
                     they call a parasite. a man who is ready for anything; but in former times he
                     was a man picked out as a companion.'</quote> Accordingly, in the ancient laws,
                  most cities mention parasites among the most honourable of their <pb n="v.1.p.371"/> officers; and, indeed, they do so to this day. And Clidemus
                  says in his Attic Women— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     of the people, and the old men, and the women who still have their first

                  still speaking about the parasites) there is also an inscription on a pillar in
                  the Anaceum to the following effect—<quote>Of the best bulls which are selected,
                     one-third is to be appropriated to the games; and of the remaining two-thirds,
                     one is to go to the priest, and the other to the parasites.</quote> But Crates,
                  in the second book of his treatise on the Attic Dialect, says—<quote>And the word
                     parasite is now used in a disreputable sense; but formerly those people were
                     called parasites who were selected to collect the sacred corn, and there was a
                     regular Hall of the parasites; on which account the following expressions occur
                     in the law of the king—</quote> That the king shall take care of the Archons
                  that they are properly appointed, and that they shall select the parasites from
                  the different boroughs, according to the statutes enacted with reference to that
                  subject. And that the parasites shall, without any evasion or fraud, select from
                  their own share a sixth part of a bushel of barley, on which all who are citizens
                  of Athens shall feast in the temple, according to the national laws and customs.
                  And that the parasites of the Acharnensians shall give a sixth part of a bushel
                  from their collection of barley to the guild of priests of Apollo. And that there
                  was a regular Hall for the parasites is shown by the following expressions in the
                  same law—<quote>For the repairs of the temple, and of the magistrates' hall, and
                     of the hall of parasites, and of the sacred house, they shall pay whatever sums
                     of money the contractors appointed by the priests think necessary.</quote> From
                  this it is evident that the place in which the parasites laid up the first-fruits
                  of the consecrated corn was called the Parasitium, or the Hall of the
                  parasites.</p>

                  Diodorus of Sinope, a comic poet, in his Heir, (from which I will cite some
                  testimonies presently,) says the same. And Aristotle, in his treatise on the
                  Constitution of the Methoneans, says— <quote>Parasites were two in number for each
                     of the archons, and one for the polemarchs. And they received a fixed allowance
                     from others, and they also took dishes of fish from the fishermen.</quote>

                  his proper name was Eucrates. And he writes thus concerning him—<quote>Eucrates,
                     who was called Corydus, when he was once feasting with some one whose house was
                     in a very shabby condition, said, 'A man who sups here ought to hold up the

                  his Chalcidian. But the statement is thoroughly proved.) Menander too mentions him
                  in his Cecryphalus, calling him Pternocopis only. And Machon the comic writer
                  mentions him.—But Machon was either a Corinthian or Sicyonian by birth, living,
                  however, in my own city of Alexandria; and he was the tutor of Aristophanes the
                  grammarian, as far as comedy went. And he died in Alexandria, and an inscription
                  to the following effect is placed upon his tomb— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>To Machon, who shall live beyond the tomb,</l>
                     <l>Machon the comic poet; for you hold</l>
                     <l>No dirty drone, but you embrace at last</l>

                  </quote> And surely this is equivalent to a statement that he was an Alexandrian
                  by birth. However that may be, Machon mentions Corydus in these terms— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  <pb n="v.1.p.381"/> And Lynceus, in the second book of his treatise on Menander,
                  says the men who got a reputation for saying witty things were Euclides the son of
                  Smicrinus, and Philoxenus called Pternocopis. And of them Euclides did at times
                  say apophthegms not unworthy of being written down and recollected but in all
                  other matters he was cold and disagreeable. Bt Philoxenus did not particularly
                  excel in short curt sayings, but still whatever he said, whether in the way of
                  gossip, or of a bitter attack on any of his companions, or of relation of
                  occurrences, was full of pleasant and witty conversation. And yet it happened that
                  Euclides was not very popular, but that Philoxenus was loved and respected by

                  whom they call parasites. And these men celebrate their praises before large
                  companies assembled together, and also to private individuals who are willing to
                  listen to them: they have also a description of people called Bards, who make them
                  music; and these are poets, who recite their praises with songs. And in his
                  thirty-fourth book, the same writer speaks of a man whose name was Apollonius, as
                  having been the parasite of Antiochus surnamed Grypus, king of Syria. And
                  Aristodemus relates that Bithys, the parasite of king Lysimachus, once, when
                  Lysimachus threw a wooden figure of a scorpion on his cloak, leaped up in a great
                  fright; but presently, when he perceived the truth, he said, <quote>I, too, will
                     frighten you, O king!—give me a talent.</quote> For Lysiachus was very stingy.

                  calling a man a flatterer and a parasite. Accordingly, Lynceus the Samian, in his
                  Commentaries, gives the name of parasite to Cleisophus, the man who is universally
                  described as the flatterer of Philip, the king of the Macedonians (but he was an
                  Athenian by birth, as Satyrus the Peripatetic affirms, in his Life of Philip). And

                     for being continually asking for something, replied, 'I am very forgetful.'
                     Afterwards, when Philip had given him a wounded horse, he sold him; and when,
                     after a time, the king <pb n="v.1.p.391"/> asked him what had become of him,
                     he answered, ' He was sold by that wound of his.' And when Philip laughed at
                     him, and took it good-humouredly, he said, 'Is it not then worth my while to
                     keep you?'</quote> And Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, makes this
                  mention of Cleisophus:—<quote>When Philip the king said that writings had been
                     brought to him from Cotys, king of Thrace, Cleisophus, who was present, said,
                     'It is well, by the gods.' And when Philip said, But what do you know of the
                     subjects mentioned in these writings?' he said, 'By the great Jupiter, you have
                     reproved me with admirable judgment.'</quote>

                     again, when his leg was hurt, he came out limping, along with the king. And if
                     ever Philip ate any harsh or sour food, he would contract his features, as if
                     he, too, had the same taste in his mouth. But in the country of the Arabs they
                     used to do these things, not out of flattery, but in obedience to some law; so
                     that whenever the king had anything the matter with any one of his limbs, the
                     courtiers pretended to be suffering the same inconvenience: for they think it
                     ridiculous to be willing to be buried with him when he dies, but not to pay him

                     which they all take. In return for which, they also share his power, and wear
                     the same dress, and eat the same food; and they die when he dies, as a matter
                     of absolute necessity, if the king dies of any disease; or if he dies in war,
                     or in any other manner. And no one can even say that any of them has shown any
                     fear of death, or has in the least sought to evade it when the king is
                     dead.</quote>

               <p>But Theopompus says, in the forty-fourth book of his <pb n="v.1.p.392"/>
                  Histories, that Philip appointed Thrasydæus the Thessalian tyrant over all those
                  of his nation, though a man who had but little intellect, but who was an egregious
                  flatterer. But Arcadion the Achæan was not a flatterer, who is mentioned by the
                  same Theopompus, and also by Duris in the fifth book of his History of Macedonian
                  Affairs. Now this Arcadion hated Philip, and on account of this hatred voluntarily
                  banished himself from his country. And he was a man of the most admirable natural
                  abilities, and numbers of clever sayings of his are related. It happened then
                  once, when Philip was sojourning at Delphi, that Arcadion also was there; and the
                  Macedonian beheld him and called him to him, and said, How much further, O
                  Arcadion, do you mean to go by way of banishment? And he replied— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Until I meet with men who know not Philip.</l>
                  </quote> But Phylarchus, in the twenty-first book of his History, says that Philip
                  laughed at this, and invited Arcadion to supper, and that in that way he got rid
                  of his enmity. But of Nicesias the flatterer of Alexander, Hegesander gives the
                  following account:—<quote>When Alexander complained of being bitten by the flies
                     and was eagerly brushing them off, a man of the name of Nicesias, one of his
                     flatterers who happened to be present, said, —Beyond all doubt those flies will
                     be far superior to all other flies, now that they have tasted your
                     blood.</quote> And the same man says that Cheirisophus also, the flatterer of
                  Dionysius, when he saw Dionysius laughing with some of his acquaintances, (but he
                  was some way off himself, so that he could not hear what they were laughing at,)
                  laughed also. And when Dionysius asked him on what account he, who could not
                  possibly hear what was said, laughed, said—I feel that confidence in you that I am
                  quite sure that what has been said is worth laughing at.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="56">
               <p>His son also, the second Dionysius, had numerous flatterers, who were called by
                  the common people Dionysiocolaces. And they, because Dionysius himself was not
                  very sharp sighted, used to pretend while at supper not to be able to see very
                  far, but they would touch whatever was near them as if they could not see it,
                  until Dionysius himself guided their hands to the dishes. And when Dionysius spat,
                  they would often put out their own faces for him to spit upon: and then <pb n="v.1.p.393"/> licking off the spittle and even his vomit, they declared that
                  it was sweeter than honey. And Timæus, in their twenty-second book of his
                  Histories, says that Democles the flatterer of the younger Dionysius, as it was
                  customary in Sicily to make a sacrifice from house to house in honour of the
                  nymphs, and for men to spend the night around their statues when quite drunk, and
                  to dance around the goddesses—Democles neglecting the nymphs, and saying that
                  there was no use in attending to lifeless deities, went and danced before
                  Dionysius. And at a subsequent time being once sent on an embassy with some
                  colleagues to Dion, when they were all proceeding in a trireme, he being accused
                  by the rest of behaving in a seditious manner in respect of this journey, and of
                  having injured the general interests of Dionysius, when Dionysius was very
                  indignant, he said that differences had arisen between himself and his colleagues,
                  because after supper they took a pæan of Phrynichus or Stesichorus, and some of
                  them took one of Pindar's and sang it; but he, with those who agreed with him,
                  went entirely through the hymns which had been composed by Dionysius himself. And
                  he undertook to bring forward undeniable proof of this assertion. For that his
                  accusers were not acquainted with the modulation of those songs, but that he on
                  the contrary was ready to sing them all through one after the other. And so, when
                  Dionysius was pacified, Democles continued, and said, <quote>But you would do me a
                     great favour, O Dionysius, if you were to order any one of those who knows it
                     to teach me the paean which you composed in honour of Aesculapius; for I hear
                     that you have taken great pains with that.</quote>

               <p>And once, when some friends were invited to supper by Dionysius, Dionysius coming
                  into the room, said, <quote>O, my friends, letters have been sent to us from the
                     generals who have been despatched to Naples;</quote> and Democles interrpting
                  him, said, <quote>By the gods, they have done well, O Dionysius.</quote> And he,
                  looking upon him, said, <quote>But how do you know whether what they have written
                     is in accordance with my expectation or the contrary?</quote>And Democles
                  replied, <quote>By the gods, you have properly rebuked me, O Dionysius.</quote>

                  was not to choose nine archons every year, but nine ambassadors to the king. But I
                  wonder at the Athenians, how they allowed him to make such a speech without
                  bringing him to trial, and yet fined Demades ten talents, because he thought
                  Alexander a god; and they put Evagoras to death, because when he went as

                  he not only bore an image of Ulysses on his seal, but that he also gave his
                  children the names of Telegonus and Anticlea. And Polybius, in the thirteenth book

                  And Baton of Sinope relates, in his book bout the tyranny of Hieronymus, that
                  Thraso, who was surnamed Carcharus, was the flatterer of Hieronymus the tyrant of
                  Syracuse, saying that he every day used to drink a great quantity of unmixed wine.
                  But another flatterer, by name Osis, caused Thraso to be put to death by
                  Hieronymus; ad he persuaded Hieronymus himself to assume the diadem, and the
                  purple and all the rest of the royal apparel, which Dionysius the tyrant was

                  writes as follows—"But how can we think Nicostratus the Argive anything but a
                  wicked man? who, when he was president of the city of Argos, and when he had
                  received all the distinctions of family, and riches, and large estates from his
                  ancestors, surpassed all men in his flatteries and attentions to the king,
                  outrunning not only those who bore a part in that expedition, but even all who had
                  lived before; for in the first place, he was so anxious for honours from the
                  barbarian, that, wishing to please him more and to be more trusted by him, he
                  brought his son to the king, a thing which no one else will ever be found to have
                  done. And then, every day when he was about to go to supper he had a table set
                  apart, to which he gave the name of the Table of the King's Deity, loading it with
                  meat and all other requisites; hearing that those who live at the doors of the
                  royal palace among the Persians do the same thing, and thinking that by this
                  courtier-like attention he should get more from the king. For he was exceedingly
                  covetous, and not scrupulous as to the means he employed forgetting money, so that
                  indeed no one was ever less so. And Lysimachus was a flatterer and the tutor of
                  Attalus the king, a man whom Callimachus sets down as a Theodorean, but Hermippus
                  sets him down in the list of the disciples of Theophrastus. And this man wrote
                  books also about the education of Attalus, full of every kind of adulation
                  imaginable. But Polybius, in the eighth book of his Histories, says,

                  But Andromachus was not allowed by the deity to escape unpunished. For having

               <p>The whole populace of the Athenians, too, was very notorious for the height to

                  the orator, in the twentieth book of his Histories, speaking of the flattery
                  practised by the Athenians towards Demetrius Poliorcetes, and saying that he

                     annoyed him greatly, as they well might. And, indeed, other parts of their
                     conduct were utterly mean and disgraceful. They consecrated temples to Leæna
                     Venus and Lamia Venus, and they erected altars and shrines as if to heroes, and
                     instituted libations in honour of Burichus, and Adeimantus, and Oxythemis, his
                     flatterers. And poems were sung in honour of all these people, so that even
                     Demetrius himself was astonished at what they did, and said that in his time

                  also flattered Demetrius, as Polemo relates in the treatise on the Ornamented
                  Portico at Sicyon; and they, too, erected a temple to Lamia Venus. But she was one
                  of Demetrius's mistresses, as also was Leæna. So that why should we wonder at the
                  Athenians, who stooped even to become flatterers of flatterers, singing pæans and
                  hymns to Demetrius himself?</p>

                     even went out to meet him with hymns, and choruses, and ithyphalli, and dancing
                     and singing, and they stood in front of him in multitudes, dancing and singing,
                     and saying that he was the only true god, and that all the rest of the gods
                     were either asleep, or gone away to a distance, or were no god at <pb n="v.1.p.398"/> all. And they called him the son of Neptune and Venus, for
                     he was eminent for beauty, and affable to all men with a natural courtesy and
                     gentleness of manner. And they fell at his feet and addressed supplications and

               <p>Such were the Athenians at that time, after flattery, that worst of wild beasts,
                  had inspired their city with frenzy, that city which once the Pythia entitled the
                  Hearth of Greece, and which Theopompus, who hated them, called the Prytaneum of
                  Greece; he who said in other places that Athens was full of drunken flatterers,
                  and sailors, and pickpockets, and also of false witnesses, sycophants, and false
                  accusers. And it is my opinion that it was they who introduced all the flattery
                  which we have been speaking of, like a storm, or other infliction, sent on men by
                  the gods; concerning which Diogenes said, very elegantly—<quote>That it was much

                     which is not entirely inelegant in its character of a flatterer, though he is
                     an odious beast, and a great injury to a state.</quote> And Theophrastus, in
                  his treatise on Flattery, <pb n="v.1.p.400"/> says that Myrtis the priest, the
                  Argive, taking by the ear Cleonymus (who was a dancer and also a flatterer, and
                  who often used to come and sit by him and his fellow-judges, and who was anxious
                  to be seen in company with those who were thought of consideration in the city),
                  and dragging him out of-the assembly, said to him in the hearing of many people,
                  You shall not dance here, and you shall not hear us. And Diphilus, in his
                  Marriage, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Colaceia (Flattery), which the Melians used to inhabit, as Theopompus relates in

               <p>But Phylarchus says, that those Athenians who settled in Lemnos were great
                  flatterers, mentioning them as such in the thirteenth book of his History. For
                  that they, wishing to display their gratitude to the descendants of Seleucus and
                  Antiochus, because Seleucus not only delivered them when they were severely
                  oppressed by Lysimachus, but also restored both their cities to them,—they, I say,
                  the Athenians in Lemnos, not only erected temples to Seleucus, but also to his son
                  Antiochus; and they have given to the cup, which at their feasts is offered at the
                  end of the banquet, the name of the cup of Seleucus the Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now some people, perverting the proper name, call this flattery <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρέσκεια,</foreign> complaisance; as Anaxandrides does in his

                  is one which flourishes only a short time. Accordingly, Alexis says in his Liar—

                  treatises, says—<quote>No flatterer is constant in his friendship. For time
                     destroys the falsehood of his pretences, and a lover is only a flatterer and a
                     pretended friend on account of youth or beauty.</quote> One of the flatterers
                  of Demetrius the king was Adeimantus of Lampsacus, who having built a temple in
                  Thriæ, and placed statues in it, called it the temple of Phila Venus, and called
                  the place itself Philæum, from Phila the mother of Demetrius; as we are told by

               <p>But Clearchus the Solensian, in his book which is inscribed Gergithius, tells us
                  whence the origin of the name flatterer is derived; and mentioning Gergithius
                  himself, from whom the treatise has its name, he says that he was one of
                  Alexander's flatterers; and he tells the story thus—<quote>That flattery debases
                     the characters of the flatterers, making them apt to despise whoever they
                     associate with; and a proof of this is, that they endure everything, well
                     knowing what they dare do. And those who are flattered by them, being puffed up
                     by their adulation, they make foolish and empty-headed, and cause them to
                     believe that they, and everything belonging to them, are of a higher order than
                     other people.</quote> And ten proceeding to mention a certain young man, a
                  Paphian by birth, but a king by the caprice of fortune, he says—"This young man
                  (and he does not mention his name) used out of his preposterous luxury to lie on a
                  couch with silver feet, with a smooth Sardian carpet spread under it of the most
                  expensive description. And over him was thrown a piece of purple cloth, edged with
                  a scarlet fringe; and he had three pillows under his head made of the finest
                  linen, and of purple colour, by which he kept himself cool. And under his feet he
                  had two pillows of the kind called Dorian, of a bright crimson colour; and on all
                  this he lay himself, clad in a white robe.</p>

               <p>"And all the monarchs who have at any time reigned in Cyprus have encouraged a
                  race of nobly-born flatterers as useful to them; for they are a possession very
                  appropriate to tyrants. And no one ever knows them (any more the they do the
                  judges of the Areopagus), either how many they are, or who they are, except that
                  perhaps some of the most <pb n="v.1.p.402"/> eminent may be known or suspected.
                  And the flatterers at Salamis are divided into two classes with reference to their
                  families; and it is from the flatterers in Salamis that all the rest of the
                  flatterers in the other parts of Cyprus are derived; and one of these two classes
                  is called the Gergini, and the other the Promalanges. Of which, the Gergini mingle
                  with the people in the city, and go about as eavesdroppers and spies in the
                  workshops and the market-places; and whatever they hear, they report every day to
                  those who are called their Principals. But the Promalanges, being a sort of
                  superior investigators, inquire more particularly into all that is reported by the
                  Gergini which appears worthy of being investigated; and the way in which they
                  conduct themselves to- wards every one is so artificial and gentle, that, as it
                  seems to me, and as they themselves allege, the very seed of notable flatterers
                  has been spread by them over all the places at a distance. Nor do they pride
                  themselves slightly on their skill, because they are greatly honoured by the
                  kings; but they say that one of the Gergini, being a descendant of those Trojans
                  whom Teucer took as slaves, having selected them from the captives, and then
                  brought and settled in Cyprus, going along-the sea-coast with a few companions,
                  sailed towards Aeolis, in order to seek out and re-establish the country of his
                  ancestors; and that he, taking some Mysians to himself, inhabited a city near the
                  Trojan Ida, which was formerly called Gergina, from the name of the inhabitants,
                  but is now called Gergitha. For some of the party being, as it seems, separated
                  from this expedition, stopped in Cymæa, being by birth a Cretan race, and not from
                  the Thessalian Tricca, as some have affirmed,—men whose ignorance I take to be
                  beyond the skill of all the descendants of Aesculapius to cure.</p>

                  as I have said before. For his slaves stood in short tunics a little behind the
                  couch: and as there are now three men on whose account all this discussion has
                  been originated, and as all these men are men who have separate names among us,
                  the one sat on the couch close to his feet, letting the feet of the young man rest
                  upon his knees, and covering them with a thin cloth; and what he did further is
                  plain enough, even if I do not mention it. And this servant is called by the
                  natives Parabystus, because he works his way into the company of those men even
                  who do not willingly receive him, by the very skilful character of his flatteries.
                  The second was one sitting on a certain chair which was placed close to the couch;
                  and he, holding by the hand of the young mar, as he let it almost drop, and
                  clinging to it, kept on rubbing it, and taking each of his fingers in turn he

                  and shared <pb n="v.1.p.404"/> his linen pillows, lying upon them in a most
                  friendly manner, And with his left hand he kept smoothing the hair of the young
                  man, and with his right hand he kept moving up and down a Phocæan fan, so as to
                  please him while waving it, without force enough to brush anything away. On which
                  account, it appears to me, that some high-born god must have been angry with him
                  and have sent a fly to attack the young man, a fly like that with whose audacity
                  Homer says that Minerva inspired Menelaus, so vigorous and fearless was it in
                  disposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>So when the young man was stung, this man uttered such a loud scream in his
                     behalf, and was so indignant, that on account of his hatred to one fly he
                     banished the whole tribe of flies from his house: from which it is quite plain
                     that he appointed this servant for this especial purpose.</quote>

                  flattering such a man as that, he invents a regular gait and dress harmonizing
                  with that of those who receive the flattery, folding his arms and wrapping himself
                  up in a small cloak; on which account some men call him Paranconistes, and some
                  call him a Repository of Attitudes. For really a flatterer does seem to be the
                  very same person with Proteus himself. Accordingly he changes into nearly every
                  sort of person, not only in form, but also in his discourse, so very varied in

                  they were named from their facility; because a flatterer will undergo anything,
                  like a person who stoops down to carry another on his back, by reason of his

                  went to Delphi, they who were anxious to put an end to his kingly power in order
                  to establish an oligarchy instead of it, (and those who wished this were Ortyges,
                  and Irus, and Echarus, who, because they were most conspicuous in paying court to
                  the princes, were called adorers and flatterers,) they, I say, being on a voyage
                  in company with Cnopus, when they were at a distance from land, bound Cnopus and
                  threw him into the sea; and then they sailed to Chios, and getting a force from
                  the tyrants there, Amphiclus and Polytechnus, they sailed by night to Erythræ, and
                  just at the same time the corpse of Cnopus was washed up on the sea-shore at
                  Erythræ, at a place which is now called Leopodon. And while Cleonice, the wife of
                  Cnopus, was busied about the offices due to the corpse, (and it was the time of
                  the festival and assembly instituted in honour of Diana Stophea,) on a sudden
                  there is heard the noise of a trumpet; and the city is taken by Ortyges and his
                  troops, and many of the friends of Cnopus are put to death; and Cleonice, hearing
                  what had happened, fled to Colophon.</p>

                     the whole of the affairs of the state, admitting none of the popular party
                     within the walls. And they established a court of justice outside the walls,
                     before the gates; and there they tried all actions, sitting as judges, clothed
                     in purple cloaks, and in tunics with purple borders, and they wore sandals with
                     many slits in them during the hot weather; but in winter they always walked
                     about in women's shoes; and they let their hair grow, and took great care of it
                     so as to have ringlets, dividing it on the top of their head with fillets of
                     yellow and purple. And they wore ornaments of solid gold, like women, and they
                     compelled some of the citizens to carry their litters, and some to act as
                     lictors to them, and some to sweep the roads. And they sent for the sons of

                     ordered to bring their own wives and daughters within. And on those who

               <p>Now from all this we may understand, my friends, of how many evils flattery is the
                  cause in human life. For Theopompus, in the nineteenth book of his history of the
                  Transactions of Philip, says, <quote>Agathocles was a slave, and one of the
                     Penestee in Thessaly, and as he had great influence with Philip by reason of
                     his flattery of him, and because he was constantly at his entertainments
                     dancing and making him laugh, Philip sent him to destroy the Perrhæbi, and to
                     govern all that part of the country. And the Macedonian constantly <pb n="v.1.p.408"/> had this kind of people about him, with whom he associated
                     the greater part of his time, because of their fondness for drinking and
                     buffoonery, and in their company he used to deliberate on the most important
                     affairs.</quote> And Hegesander the Delphian gives a similar account of him,
                  and relates how he sent a large sum of money to the men who are assembled at
                  Athens at the temple of Hercules in Diomea, and who say laughable things; and he
                  ordered some men to write down all that was said by them, and to send it to him.
                  And Theopompus, in the twenty-sixth book of his History, says <quote>that Philip
                     knowing that the Thessalians were an intemperate race, and very profligate in
                     their way of living, prepared some entertainments for them, and endeavoured in
                     every possible manner to make himself agreeable to them. For he danced and
                     revelled, and practised every kind of intemperance and debauchery. And he was
                     by nature a buffoon, and got drunk every day, and he delighted in those
                     occupations which are consistent with such practices, and with those who are
                     called witty men, who say and do things to provoke laughter. And he attached
                     numbers of the Thessalians who were intimate with him to himself, still more by
                     his entertainments than by his presents.</quote> And Dionysius the Sicilian
                  used to do very nearly the same thing, as Eubulus the comic poet tells us in his
                  play entitled Dionysius;— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But he is harsh and rigorous to the solemn,</l>
                     <l>But most good-humour'd to all flatterers,</l>
                     <l>And all who jest with freedom. For he thinks</l>
                     <l>Those men alone are free, though slaves they be.</l>

            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="77">
               <p>And indeed Dionysius was not the only person who encouraged and received those who
                  had squandered their estates on drunkenness and gambling and all such debauchery
                  as that, for Philip also did the same. And Theopompus speaks of such of them in
                  the forty-ninth book of his History, where he writes as follows:—<quote>Philip
                     kept at a distance all men who were well regulated in their conduct and who
                     took care of their property; but the extravagant and those who lived in
                     gambling and drunkenness he praised and honoured. And therefore he not only
                     took care that they should always have such amusements, but he encouraged them
                     to devote themselves to all sorts of injustice and debauchery besides. For what
                     disgraceful or iniquitous practices were there to which <pb n="v.1.p.409"/>
                     these men were strangers, or what virtuous or respectable habits were there
                     which they did not shun? Did they not at all times go about shaven and
                     carefully made smooth, though they were men? And did not they endeavour to
                     misuse one another though they had beards? And they used to go about attended
                     by two or three lovers at a time; and they expected no complaisance from others
                     which they were not prepared to exhibit themselves. On which account a man
                     might very reasonably have thought them not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑταῖροι</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑταῖραι,</foreign> and one
                     might have called them not soldiers, but prostitutes. For though they were
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδροφόνοι</foreign> by profession, they were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρόπορνοι</foreign> by practice. And in addition to all this,
                     instead of loving sobriety, they loved drunkenness; and instead of living
                     respectably they sought every opportunity of robbing and murdering; and as for
                     speaking the truth, and adhering to their agreements, they thought that conduct
                     quite inconsistent with their characters; but to perjure themselves and cheat,
                     they thought the most venerable behaviour possible. And they disregarded what
                     they had, but they longed for what they had not; and this too, though a great
                     part of Europe belonged to them. For I think that the companions of Philip, who
                     did not at that time amount to a greater number than eight hundred, had
                     possession so far as to enjoy the fruits of more land than any ten thousand
                     Greeks, who had the most fertile and large estates.</quote> And he makes a very
                  similar statement about Dionysius, in his twenty-first book, when he says,
                     <quote>Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily encouraged above all others those who
                     squandered their property in drunkenness and gambling and intemperance of that
                     sort. For he wished every one to become ruined and ready for any iniquity, and

                     to pour libations in his honour, calling him Demetrius the only king, and
                     Ptolemy only the prefect of the flee, and Lysimachus only a steward, and
                     Seleucus only a superintendent of elephants, and in this way he incurred no
                     small amount of hatred.</quote> And Herodotus states that Amasis the <pb n="v.1.p.410"/> king of the Egyptians was always a man full of tricks, and one

                  man he says he was very fond of feasting and of jesting, and he was not at all a
                  serious man. And Nicolaus, in the twenty-seventh book of his History, says that
                  Sylla the Roman general was so fond of mimics and buffoons, being a man very much
                  addicted to amusement, that he gave such men several portions of the public land.
                  And the satyric comedies which he wrote himself in his native language, show of

                  themselves once to the oracle at Delphi in hopes to be relieved from some calamity
                  or other. And that the God answered them, <quote>That if they sacrificed a bull to
                     Neptune and threw it into the sea without once laughing, the evil would
                     cease.</quote> And they, fearing lest they should make a blunder in obeying the
                  oracle, forbade any of the boys to be present at the sacrifice; however, one boy,
                  hearing of what was going to be done, mingled with the crowd, and then when they
                  hooted him and drove him away, <quote>Why,</quote> said he, <quote>are you afraid
                     lest I should spoil your sacrifice?</quote> and when they laughed at this
                  question of his, they perceived that the god meant to show them by a fact that an
                  inveterate custom cannot be remedied. And Sosicrates, in the first book of his
                  History of Crete, says that the Phæstians have a certain peculiarity, for that
                  they seem to practise saying ridiculous things from their earliest childhood; on
                  which account it has often happened to them to say very reasonable and witty
                  things because of their early habituation: and therefore all the Cretans attribute

                     islands called Arææ (and they are between Cnidos and Syme) a difference arose,
                     after the death of Triopas, among those who had set out with him on his
                     expedition, and some returned home, and others remained with Phorbas, and came
                     to Ialysus, and others proceeded with Periergus, and occupied the district of
                     Cameris. And on this it is said that Periergus uttered curses against Phorbas,
                     and on this account the islands were called Arææ. But Phorbas having met with
                     shipwreck, he and Parthenia, the sister of Phorbas and Periergus, swam ashore
                     to Ialysus, at the point called Schedia. And Thamneus met with them, as he
                     happened to be hunting near Schedia, and took them to his own house, intending
                     to receive them hospitably, and sent on a servant as a messenger to tell his
                     wife to prepare everything necessary, as he was bringing home strangers. But
                     when he came to his house and found nothing prepared, he himself put corn into
                     a mill, and everything else that was requisite, and then ground it himself and
                     feasted them. And Phorbas was so delighted with this hospitality, that when he

                     should be performed by free men. And so this custom continued to prevail in the

                  their intellect, give themselves up to the guidance of those who are wiser than
                  themselves, in order that receiving from them care and advice, and assistance in
                  necessary matters, they may in their turn requite them with such services as they
                  are able to render. And in this manner the Mariandyni became subject to the people
                  of Heraclea, promising to act as their subjects for ever, if they would supply
                  them with what they stood in need of; having made an agreement beforehand, that
                  none of them would sell anything out of the territory of Heraclea, but that they
                  would sell in that district alone. And perhaps it is on this account that

               <p>And Plato, in the sixth book of the Laws, says,—"The whole question about servants
                  is full of difficulty; for of all the Greeks, the system of the Helots among the
                  Lacedæ- monians causes the greatest perplexity and dispute, some people affirming
                  that it is a wise institution, and some con- sidering it as of a very opposite
                  character. But the system of slavery among the people of Heraclea would cause less
                  dis- pute than the subject condition of the Mariandyni; and so too would the
                  condition of the Thessalian Penestæ. And if we con- sider all these things, what
                  ought we to do with respect to the acquisition of servants? For there is nothing
                  sound in the feelings of slaves; nor ought a prudent man to trust them in anything
                  of importance. And the wisest of all poets says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Jove fix'd it certain that whatever day</l>
                     <l>Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away.</l>
                  </quote> And it has been frequently shown by facts, that a slave in an
                  objectionable and perilous possession; especially in the fre- quent revolts of the
                  Messenians, and in the case of those cities which have many slaves, speaking
                  different languages, in which many evils arise from that circumstance. And also we
                  may come to the same conclusion from the exploits and sufferings of all sorts of
                  robbers, who infest the Italian coasts <pb n="v.1.p.416"/> as piratical
                  vagabonds. And if any one considers all these cir- cumstances, he may well doubt
                  what course ought to be pursued with respect to all these people. Two remedies now
                  are left to us—either never to allow, for the future, any person's slaves to be
                  one another's fellow-countrymen, and, as far as possible, to prevent their even
                  speaking the same language: and he should also keep them well, not only for their
                  sake, but still more for his own; and he should behave towards them with as little
                  insolence as possible. But it is right to chastise them with justice; not
                  admonishing them as if they were free men, so as to make them arrogant: and every
                  word which we address to slaves ought to be, in some sort, a command. And a man
                  ought never to play at all with his slaves, or jest with them, whether they be
                  male or female. And as to the very foolish way in which many people treat their
                  slaves, allowing them great indulgence and great licence, they only make
                  everything more difficult for both parties: they make obedience harder for the one
                  to practise, and authority harder for the others to exercise.</p>

               <p>Now of all the Greeks, I conceive that the Chians were the first people who used
                  slaves purchased with money, as is related by Theopompus, in the seventeenth book
                  of his Histories; where he says,—<quote>The Chians were the first of the Greeks,
                     after the Thessalians and Lacedæmonians, who used slaves. But they did not
                     acquire them in the same manner as those others did; for the Lacedæmonians and
                     the Thessalians will be found to have derived their slaves from Greek tribes,
                     who formerly inhabited the country which they now possess: the one having
                     Achean slaves, but the Thessalians having Perrhæbian and Magnesian slaves; and
                     the one nation called their slaves Helots, and the others called them Penestæ.
                     But the Chians have barbarian slaves, and they have bought them at a
                     price.</quote> Theopompus, then, has given this account. But I think that, on
                  this account, the Deity was angry with the Chians; for at a subsequent period they
                  were subdued by their slaves. Accordingly, Nymphodorus the Syracusan, in his
                  Voyage along the Coast of Asia, gives this account of them:—"The slaves of the
                  Chians deserted them, and escaped to the mountains; and then, collecting in great
                  numbers, ravaged the country-houses about; for the island is very rugged, and much
                  overgrown with trees. But, a little before <pb n="v.1.p.417"/> our time, the
                  Chians themselves relate, that one of their slaves deserted, and took up his
                  habitation in the mountains; and, being a man of great courage and very prosperus
                  in his warlike undertakings, he assumed the command o the runaway slaves, as a
                  king would take the command of an army; and though the Chians often made
                  expeditions against him, they were able to effect nothing. And when Drimacus (for
                  that was the name of this runaway slave) found that they were being destroyed,
                  without being able to effect anything, he addressed them in this language: 'O
                  Chians! you who are the masters, this treatment which you are now receiving from
                  your servants will never cease; for how should it cease, when it is God who causes
                  it, in accordance with the prediction of the oracle? But if you will be guided by
                  me, and if you will leave us in peace, then I will be the originator of much good
                  fortune to you.'</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="89">
               <p>"Accordingly, the Chians, having entered into a treaty with him, and having made a
                  truce for a certain time, Drimacus prepares measures and weights, and a private
                  seal for himself; and, throwing it to the Chians, he said, Whatever I take from
                  any one of you, I shall take according to these measures and these weights; and
                  when I have taken enough, I will then leave the storehouses, having sealed them up
                  with this seal. And as to all the slaves who desert from you, I will inquire what
                  cause of complaint they have; and if they seem to me to have been really subject
                  to any incurable oppression, which has been the reason of their running away, I
                  will retain them with me; but if they have no sufficient or reasonable ground to
                  allege, I will send them back to their masters.' Accordingly, the rest of the
                  slaves, seeing that the Chians agreed to this state of things, very
                  good-humouredly did not desert nearly so much for the future, fearing the judgment
                  which Drimacus might pass upon them And the runaways who were with him feared him
                  a great deal more than they did their own masters, and did everything that he
                  required, obeying him as their general; for he punished the refractory with great
                  severity: and he permitted no one to ravage the land, nor to commit any other
                  crime of any sort, without his consent. And at the time of festivals, he went
                  about, and took from the fields wine, and such animals for victims as were in good
                  condition, and whatever else the <pb n="v.1.p.418"/> masters were inclined or
                  able to give him; and if he per- ceived that any one was intriguing against him,
                  or laying any plot to injure him or overthrow his power, he chastised him.</p>

                  <quote>Then (for the city had made a proclamation, that it would give a great
                     reward to any one who took him prisoner, or who brought in his head,) this
                     Drimacus, as he became older, calling one of his most intimate friends into a
                     certain place, says to him, 'You know that I have loved you above all men, and
                     you are to me as my child and my son, and as everything else. I now have lived
                     long enough, but you are young and just in the prime of life. What, then, are
                     we to do? You must show yourself a wise and brave man; for, since the city of
                     the Chians offers a great reward to any one who shall kill me, and also
                     promises him his freedom, you must cut off my head, and carry it to Chios, and
                     receive the money which they offer, and so be prosperous.' But when the young
                     man refused, he at last persuaded him to do so; and so he cut off his head, and
                     took it to the Chians, and received from them the rewards which they had
                     offered by proclamation: and, having buried the corpse of Drimacus, he departed
                     to his own country. And the Chians, being again injured and plundered by their
                     slaves, remembering the moderation of him who was dead, erected a Heroum in
                     their country, and called it the shrine of the GENTLE HERO. And even now the
                     runaway slaves bring to that shrine the first-fruits of all the plunder they
                     get; and they say that Drimacus still appears to many of the Chians in their
                     sleep, and informs them beforehand of the stratagems of their slaves who are
                     plotting against them: and to whomsoever he appears, they come to that place,
                     and sacrifice to him, where this shrine is.</quote>

               <p>Nymphodorus, then, has given this account; but in many copies of his history, I
                  have found that Drimachus is not mentioned by name. But I do not imagine that any
                  one of you is ignorant, either of what the prince of all historians, Herodotus,
                  has related of the Chian Panionium, and of what he justly suffered who castrated
                  free boys and sold them. But Nicolaus the Peripatetic, and Posidonius the Stoic,
                  in their Histories, both state that the Chians were enslaved by Mithridates, the
                  tyrant of Cappadocia; and were given up by him, bound, to their own slaves, for
                  the purpose of being <pb n="v.1.p.419"/> transported into the land of the
                  Colchians,—so really angry with them was the Deity, as being the first people who
                  used purchased slaves, while most other nations provided for themselves by their
                  own industry. And, perhaps, this s what the proverb originated in, <quote>A Chian

                  against men who ill treated their slaves. Accordingly, Hyperides, the orator, in

                     had done so.</quote> And Lycurgus made a similar statement, in his first speech

                  revolted against their masters, and fled to the mountain which is in the island,
                  and from thence did great injury to the Samians. But, in the sixth year after
                  these occurrences, the Samians, by the advice of an oracle, made a treaty with the
                  slaves, on certain agreements; and the slaves were allowed to depart uninjured

                  should like to know what need we should have of servants. But the ancients,

                  </quote> And Ulpian, who was always fond of contradicting him, said in reply to

                  said, —O Leucus, if you have any remnants of bread, give them to the dogs. And
                  Cynulcus rejoined,—If I had been invited here only to listen to discussions, I

                  the Helots of the Lacedæmonians and of the Thessalian Penestæ, says, <quote>The

                     Leleges as slaves.</quote> But Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his History,
                  says that the Byzantians used the Bithynians in the same manner, just as the
                  Lacedæmonians do the Helots. But respecting those who among the Lacedæmonians are
                  called Epeunacti, and they also are slaves, Theopompus gives a very clear account
                  in the thirty-second book of his History, speaking as follows:—<quote>When many of
                     the Lacedæmonians had been slain in the war against the Messenians, those who
                     were left being afraid lest their enemies should become aware of their desolate
                     condition, put some of the Helots into the beds of those who were dead; and
                     afterwards they made those men citizens, and called them Epeunacti, because

                  thirty-third book of his History, that among the Sicyonians there are some slaves
                  who are called Catonacophori, being very similar to the Epeunacti. And Menæchmus
                  gives a similar account in his History of the affairs of Sicyon, and says that
                  there are some slaves called Catonacophori, who very much resemble the Epeunacti.
                  And again, Theopompus, in the second book of his Philippics, says that the
                  Arcadians had three hundred thousand slaves, whom they called Prospelatæ, like the

               <p>But the class called Mothaces among the Lacedæmonians are freemen, but still not
                  citizens of Lacedæmon. And Phylarchus speaks of them thus, in the twenty-fifth
                  book of his History—<quote>But the Mothaces are foster-brothers of Lacedæmonian
                     citizens. For each of the sons of the citizens has one or two, or even more

               <p>But Timæus of Tauromenium, forgetting himself, (and Polybius the Megalopolitan
                  attacks him for the assertion, <pb n="v.1.p.428"/> in the twelfth book of his
                  Histories,) says that it is not usual for the Greeks to possess slaves. But the
                  same man, writing under the name of Epitimæus, (and this is what Ister the pupil
                  of Callimachus calls him in the treatise which he wrote against him,) says that
                  Mnason the Phocian had more than a thousand slaves. And in the third book of his
                  History, Epitimæus said that the city of the Corinthians was so flourishing that
                  it possessed four hundred and sixty thousand slaves. On which account I imagine it
                  was that the Pythian priestess called them The People who measured with a Chœnix.
                  But Ctesicles, in the third book of his Chronicles, says that in the hundred and
                  fifteenth Olympiad, there was an investigation at Athens conducted by Demetrius
                  Phalereus into the number of the inhabitants of Attica, and the Athenians were
                  found to amount, to twenty-one thousand, and the Metics to ten thousand, and the
                  slaves to four hundred thousand. But Nicias the son of Niceratus, as that
                  admirable writer Xenophon has said in his book on Revenues, when he had a thousand
                  servants, let them out to Sosias the Thracian to work in the silver mines, on
                  condition of his paying him an obol a day for every one of them. And Aristotle, in
                  his history of the Constitution of the Aeginetæ, says that the Aeginetans had four
                  hundred and seventy thousand slaves. But Agatharchides the Cnidian, in the
                  thirty-eighth book of his history of the Affairs of Europe, says that the
                  Dardanians had great numbers of slaves, some of them having a thousand, and some
                  even more; and that in time of peace they were all employed in the cultivation of
                  the land; but that in time of war they were all divided into regiments, each set
                  of slaves having their own master for their commander.</p>

               <p>After all these statements, Laurentius rose up and said,—But each of the Romans
                  (and this is a fact with which you are well acquainted, my friend Masyrius) had a
                  great many slaves. For many of them had ten thousand or twenty thousand, or even a
                  greater number, not for the purposes of income, as the rich Nicias had among the
                  Greeks; but the greater part of the Romans when they go forth have a large retinue
                  of slaves accompanying them. And out of the myriads of Attic slaves, the greater
                  part worked in the mines, being kept in chains: at all events Posidonius, whom you
                  are often quoting, the philosopher I mean, says that once <pb n="v.1.p.429"/>
                  they revolted and put to death the guards of the mines; and that they seized on
                  the Acropolis on Sunium, and that for a very long time they ravaged Attica. And
                  this was the time when the second revolt of the slaves took place in Sicily. And
                  there were many revolts of the slaves, and more than a million of slaves were
                  destroyed in them. And Cæcilius, the orator from Cale Acte, wrote a treatise on
                  the Servile Wars. And Spartacus the gladiator, having escaped from Capua, a city
                  of Italy, about the time of the Mithridatic war, prevailed on a great body of
                  slaves to join him in the revolt, (and he himself was a slave, being a Thracian by
                  birth,) and overran the whole of Italy for a considerable time, great numbers of
                  slaves thronging daily to his standard. And if he had not died in a battle fought
                  against Licinius Crassus, he would have caused no ordinary trouble to our
                  countrymen, as Eunus did in Sicily.</p>

               <p>But the ancient Romans were prudent citizens, and eminent for all kinds of good
                  qualities. Accordingly Scipio, surnamed Africanus, being sent out by the Senate to
                  arrange all the kingdoms of the world, in order that they might be put into the
                  hands of those to whom they properly belonged, took with him only five slaves, as
                  we are informed by Polybius and Posidonius. And when one of them died on the
                  journey, he sent to his agents at home to bring him another instead of him, and to
                  send him to him. And Julius Cæsar, the first man who ever crossed over to the
                  British isles with a thousand vessels, had with him only three servants
                  altogether, as Cotta, who at that time acted as his lieutenant-general, relates in
                  his treatise on the History and Constitution of the Romans, which is written in
                  our national language. But Smindyrides the Sybarite was a very different sort of
                  man, my Greek friends, who, when he went forth to marry Agaroste, the daughter of
                  Cleisthenes, carried his luxury and ostentation to such a height, that he took
                  with him a thousand slaves, fishermen, bird-catchers, and cooks. But this man,
                  wishing to display how magnificently he was used to live, according to the account
                  given to us by Chamæleon of Pontus, in his book on Pleasure, (but the same book is
                  also attribute to Theophrastus,) said that for twenty years he had never seen the
                  sun rise or set; and this he considered a great and marvellous proof of his wealth
                  and happiness. For he, as it seems, used <pb n="v.1.p.430"/> to go to bed early
                  in the morning, and to get up in the even- ing, being in my opinion a miserable
                  man in both particulars. But Histiæus of Pontus boasted, and it was an honourable
                  boast, that he had never once seen the sun rise or set, because he had been at all
                  times intent upon study, as we are told by Nicias of Nicæa in his Successions.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="106">
               <p>What then are we to think? Had not Scipio and Caesar any slaves? To be sure they
                  had, but they abided by the laws of their country, and lived with moderation,
                  preserving the habits sanctioned by the constitution. For it is the conduct of
                  prudent men to abide by those ancient institutions under which they and their
                  ancestors have lived, and made war upon and subdued the rest of the world; and
                  yet, at the same time, if there were any useful or honourable institutions among
                  the people whom they have subdued, those they take for their imitation at the same
                  time that they take the prisoners. And this was the conduct of the Romans in olden
                  time; for they, maintaining their national customs, at the same time introduced
                  from the nations whom they had subdued every relic of desirable practices which
                  they found, leaving what was useless to them, so that they should never be able to
                  regain what they had lost. Accordingly they learnt from the Greeks the use of all
                  machines and engines for conducting sieges; and with those engines they subdued
                  the very people of whom they had learnt them. And when the Phœnicians had made
                  many discoveries in nautical science, the Romans availed themselves of these very
                  discoveries to subdue them. And from the Tyrrhenians they derived the practice of
                  the entire army advancing to battle in close phalanx; and from the Samnites they
                  learnt the use of the shield, and from the Iberians the use of the javelin. And
                  learning different things from different people, they improved upon them: and
                  imitating in everything the constitution of the Lacedæmonians, they preserved it
                  better than the Lacedæmonians themselves; but now, having selected whatever was
                  useful from the practices of their enemies, they have at the same time turned
                  aside to imitate them in what is vicious and mischievous.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="107">
               <p>For, as Posidonius tells us, their national mode of life was originally temperate
                  and simple, and they used everything which they possessed in an unpretending and
                  unosten- <pb n="v.1.p.431"/> tatious manner. Moreover they displayed wonderful
                  piety towards the Deity, and great justice, and great care to behave equitably
                  towards all men, and great diligence in cultivating the earth. And we may see this
                  from the national sacrifices which we celebrate. For we proceed by ways regularly
                  settled and defined. So that we bear regularly appointed offerings, and we utter
                  regular petitions in our prayers, an we perform stated acts in all our sacred
                  ceremonies. They are also simple and plain. And we do all this without being
                  either clothed or attired as to our persons in any extraordinary manner, and
                  without indulging in any extraordinary pomp when offering the first-fruits. But we
                  wear simple garments and shoes, and on our heads we have rough hats made of the
                  skins of sheep, and we carry vessels to minister in of earthenware and brass. And
                  in these vessels we carry those meats and liquors which are procured with the
                  least trouble, thinking it absurd to send offerings to the gods in accordance with
                  our national customs, but to provide for ourselves according to foreign customs.
                  And, therefore, all the things which are expended upon ourselves are measured by
                  their use; but what we offer. to the gods are a sort of first- fruits of them.</p>

               <p>Now Mucius Scævola was one of the three men in Rome who were particular in their
                  observance of the Fannian law; Quintus Aelius Tubero and Rutilius Rufus being the
                  other two, the latter of whom is the man who wrote the History of his country.
                  Which law enjoined men not to entertain more than three people besides those in
                  the house; but on market-days a man might entertain five. And these market-days
                  happened three times in the month. The law also forbade any one to spend in
                  provisions more than two drachmæ and a half. And they were allowed to spend
                  fifteen talents a-year on cured meat and whatever vegetables the earth produces,
                  and on boiled pulse. But as this allowance was insufficient, men gradually
                  (because those who transgressed the law and spent money lavishly raised the price
                  of whatever was to be bought) advanced to a more liberal style of living without
                  violating the law. For Tubero used to buy birds at a drachma a-piece from the men
                  who lived on his own farms. And Rutilius used to buy fish from his own slaves who
                  worked as fishermen for three obols for a pound of fish; <pb n="v.1.p.432"/>
                  especially when he could get what is called the Thurian; and that is a part of the
                  sea-dog which goes by that name. But Mucius agreed with those who were benefited
                  by him to pay for all he bought at a similar valuation. Out of so many myriads of
                  men then these were the only ones who kept the law with a due regard to their
                  oaths; and who never received even the least present; but they gave large presents
                  to others, and especially to those who had been brought up at the same school with
                  them. For they all clung to the doctrines of the Stoic school.</p>

               <p>But of the extravagance which prevails at the present time Lucullus was the first
                  oiiginator, he who subdued Mithridates, as Nicolaus the Peripatetic relates. For
                  he, coming to Rome after the defeat of Mithridates, and also after that of
                  Tigranes, the king of Armenia, and having triumphed, and having given in an
                  account of his exploits in war, proceeded to an extravagant way of living from his
                  former simplicity, and was the first teacher of luxury to the Romans, having
                  amassed the wealth of the two before-mentioned kings. But the famous Cato, as
                  Polybius tells us in the thirty-fourth book of his History, was very indignant,
                  and cried out, that some men had introduced foreign luxury into Rome, having
                  bought an earthen jar of pickled fish from Pontus for three hundred drachmæ, and
                  some beautiful boys at a higher price than a man might buy a field.</p>

                     even now,</quote> says Posidonius, <quote>those who are in very easy
                     circumstances are used to accustom their sons to drink as much water as
                     possible, and to eat whatever they can get. And very often,</quote> says he,
                     <quote>the father or mother asks their son whether he chooses to have pears or
                     nuts for his supper; and then he, eating some of these things, is contented and
                     goes to bed.</quote> But now, as Theopompus tells us in the first book of his
                  history of the Actions of Philip, there is no one of those who are even tolerably
                  well off who does not provide a most sumptuous table, and who has not cooks and a
                  great many more attendants, and who does not spend more on his daily living than
                  formerly men used to spend on their festivals and sacrifices.</p>

               <p>AND when the Banquet was now finished, the cynics, thinking that the festival of
                  the Phagesia was being celebrated, were delighted above all things, and Cynulcus
                  said, —While we are supping, O Ulpian, since it is on words that you are feasting
                  us, I propose to you this question,—In what author do you find any mention of the
                  festivals called Phagesia, and Phagesiposia? And he, hesitating, and bidding the
                  slaves desist from carrying the dishes round, though it was now evening, said,—I
                  do not recollect, you very wise man, so that you may tell us yourself, in order
                  that you may sup more abundantly and more pleasantly. And he rejoined, —If you
                  will promise to thank me when I have told you, I will tell you. And as he agreed
                  to thank him, he continued; —Clearchus, the pupil of Aristotle, but a Solensian by
                  birth, in the first book of his treatise on Pictures, (for I recollect his very
                  expressions, because I took a great fancy to them,) speaks as
                     follows:—<quote>Phagesia—but some call the festival Phagesiposia—but this
                     festival has ceased, as also has that of the Rhapsodists, which they celebrated
                     about the time of the Dionysiac festival, in which every one as they passed by
                     sang a hymn to the god by way of doing him honour.</quote> This is what
                  Clearchus wrote. And if you doubt it, my friend, I, who have got the book, will
                  not mind lending it to you. And you may learn a good deal from it, and get a great
                  many questions to ask us out of it. For he relates that Calias the Athenian
                  composed a Grammatical Tragedy, from which Euripides in his Medea, and Sophocles
                  in his Œdipus derived their choruses and the arrangement of their plot.</p>

               <p>And when all the guests marvelled at the literary accomplishments of Cynulcus,
                  Plutarch said,—In like manner there used to be celebrated in my own Alexandria a
                  Flagon-bearing festival, which is mentioned by Eratosthenes in his treatise
                  entitled Arsinoe. And he speaks as follows:— <quote>When Ptolemy was instituting a
                     festival and all kinds of <pb n="v.2.p.434"/> sacrifices, and especially those
                     which relate to Bacchus, Arsinoe asked the man who bore the branches, what day
                     he was celebrating now, and what festival it was. And when he replied, 'It is
                     called the Lagynophoria; and the guests lie down on beds and so eat all that
                     they have brought with them, and every one drinks out of his own flagon which
                     he has brought from home;' and when he had departed, she, looking towards us,
                     said, 'It seems a very dirty kind of party; for it is quite evident that it
                     must be an assembly of a mixed multitude, all putting down stale food and such
                     as is altogether unseasonable and unbecoming.' But if the kind of feast had
                     pleased her, then the queen would not have objected to preparing the very same
                     things herself, as is done at the festival called Choes. For there every one
                     feasts separately, and the inviter only supplies the materials for the
                     feast.</quote>

               <p>But one of the Grammarians who were present, looking on the preparation of the
                  feast, said,—In the next place, how shall we ever be able to eat so large a
                  supper? Perhaps we are to go on <quote>during the night,</quote> as that witty
                  writer Aristophanes says in his Aeolosicon, where however his expression is
                     <quote>during the whole night.</quote> And, indeed, Homer uses the preposition
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ</foreign> in the same way, for he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He lay within the cave stretch'd o'er the sheep (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ

                  And Daphnus the physician answered him; Meals taken late at night, my friend, are
                  more advantageous for everybody. For the influence of the moon is well adapted to
                  promote the digestion of food, since the moon has putrefying properties; and
                  digestion depends upon putrefaction. Accordingly victims slain at night are more
                  digestible; and wood which is cut down by moonlight decays more rapidly. And also
                  the greater proportion of fruits ripen by moonlight.</p>

               <p>But since there were great many sorts of fish, and those very different both as to
                  size and beauty, which had been served up and which were still being constantly
                  served up for the guests, Myrtilus said,—Although all the different dishes which
                  we eat, besides the regular meal, are properly called by one generic name,
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄψον,</foreign> still it is very deservedly that on
                  account of its delicious taste fish has prevailed over everything else, and has
                  appropriated the name to itself; <pb n="v.2.p.435"/> because men are so
                  exceedingly enamoured of this kind of food. Accordingly we speak of men as
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφάγοι,</foreign> not meaning people who eat beef (such
                  as Hercules was, who ate beef and green figs mixed together); nor do we mean by
                  such a term a man who is fond of figs; as was Plato the philosopher, according to
                  the account given of him by Phanocritus in his treatise on the Glorious: and he
                  tells us in the same book that Arcesilas was fond of grapes: but we mean by the
                  term only those people who haunt the fish-market. And Philip of Macedon was fond
                  of apples, and so was his son Alexander, as Dorotheus tells us in the sixth book
                  of his history of the Life and Actions of Alexander. But Chares of Mitylene
                  relates that Alexander, having found the finest apples which he had ever seen in
                  the country around Babylon, filled boats with them, and had a battle of apples
                  from the vessels, so as to present a most beautiful spectacle. And I am not
                  ignorant that, properly speaking, whatever is prepared for being eaten by the
                  agency of fire is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄψον.</foreign> For indeed the word
                  is either identical with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐψὸν,</foreign> or else perhaps it
                  is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπτάω,</foreign> to roast.</p>

                  </quote> one of the company asked whether any one before Sophocles ever used this
                  word; to whom Zoilus replied,—But I, who am not a person <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφαγίστατος</foreign> [exceedingly fond of fish], (for that is a word which
                  Xenophon has used in his Memorabilia, where he writes, <quote>He is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφαγίστατος</foreign> and the greatest fool
                  possible,</quote>) am well aware that the man who wrote the poem Titanomachia [or
                  the Battle of the Giants], whether he be Eumelus the Corinthian, or Arctinus, or
                  whatever else his name may chance to have been, in the second book of his poem

                  </quote> And Sophocles was very fond of the Epic Cycle, so that he composed even
                  entire plays in which he has followed the stories told in their fables.</p>

               <p>Presently when the tunnies called Amiæ were put on the table, some one
                  said,—Aristotle speaks of this fish, and says that they have gills out of sight,
                  and that they have very sharp teeth, and that they belong to the gregarious and
                  carnivorous class of fishes: and that they have a gall of equal extent with their
                  whole intestines, and a spleen of corresponding proportions. It is said also that
                  when they are hooked, they leap up towards the fisherman, and bite through the
                  line and so escape. And Archippus mentions them in his play entitled the Fishes,
                  where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  of all those who follow his rules, in everything which belongs to pleasure, which
                  is the ruin of everything. For Epicurus says, without any concealment, but
                  speaking with a loud voice, as it were, <quote>For I am not able to distinguish
                     what is good if you once take away the pleasure arising from sweet flavours,
                     and if you also take away amatory pleasures.</quote> For this wise man thinks
                  that even the life of the intemperate man is an unimpeachable one, if he enjoys an
                  immunity from fear, and also mirth. On which account also the comic poets, running
                  down the Epicureans, attack them as mere servants and ministers of pleasure and

               <p>And about Epicurus, Timon, in the third book of his Silli, speaks as follows:—

                     <l>Seeking at all times to indulge his stomach,</l>

                  </quote> For, on account of his stomach, and of the rest of his sensual pleasures,
                  the man was always flattering Idomeneus and Metrodorus. And Metrodorus himself,
                  not at all disguising this admirable principle of his, says, somewhere or other,
                     <quote>The fact is, Timocrates, my natural philosopher, that every
                     investigation which is guided by principles of nature, fixes its ultimate aim
                     entirely on gratifying the stomach.</quote> For Epicurus was the tutor of all
                  these men; who said, shouting it out, as I may say, <quote>The fountain and root
                     of every good is the pleasure of the stomach: and all wise rules, and all
                     superfluous rules, are measured alike by this standard.</quote> And in his
                  treatise on the Chief Good, he speaks nearly as follows: <quote>For I am not able
                     to understand what is good, if I leave out of consideration the pleasures which
                     arise from delicately-flavoured food, and if I <pb n="v.2.p.440"/> also leave
                     out the pleasures which arise from amatory indulgences; and if I also omit
                     those which arise from music, and those, too, which are derived from the
                     contemplation of beauty and the gratification of the eyesight.</quote> And,
                  proceeding a little further, he says, "All that is beautiful is naturally to be
                  honoured; and so is virtue, and everything of that sort, if it assists in
                  producing or causing pleasure. But if it does not contribute to that end, then it

                  says <quote>that he, when he had arrived among the gods, and had begun to live
                     among them, had leave given him by Jupiter to ask for whatever he wished; and
                     that he, being a man quite insatiable in the gratification of his appetites,
                     asked that it might be granted to him to indulge them to their full extent, and
                     to live in the same manner as the gods. And that Jupiter was indignant at this
                     request, and, according to his promise, fulfilled his prayer; but still, that
                     he might not enjoy what he had before him, but be everlastingly tormented, he
                     hung a stone over his head, on account of which he should be unable to get at
                     any of the things which he had before him.</quote> Some of the Stoics also were
                  addicted to this kind of pleasure At all events, Eratosthenes the Cyrenean, who
                  was a pupil of Ariston the Chian, who was one of the sect of the Stoics, in his
                  treatise which is entitled Ariston, represents his master as subsequently being
                  much addicted to luxury, speaking a follows: <pb n="v.2.p.442"/>
                  <quote>And before now, I have at times discovered him breaking down, as it were,
                     the partition wall between pleasure and virtue, and appearing on the side of
                     pleasure.</quote> And Apollophanes (and he was an acquaintance of Ariston), in
                  his Ariston (for he also wrote a book with that title), shows the way in which his
                  master was addicted to pleasure. And why need we mention Dionysius of Heraclea?
                  who openly discarded his covering of virtue, and put on a robe embroidered with
                  flowers, and assumed the name of The altered Man; and, although he was an old man,
                  he apostatized from the doctrines of the Stoics, and passed over to the school of
                  Epicurus; and, in consequence, Timon said of him, not without some point and
                  felicity— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  also mentions him in his book on Fishes, saying, <quote>Some call the anthias by
                     the name of callicthys, and also by that of callionymus and ellops.</quote> And
                  Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says that he is called wolf by some

                  full of delicious juice, and easy of digestion; but not very good for the stomach.
                  But Aristotle says that the callicthys is a fish with serrated teeth, carnivorous
                  and gregarious. And Epicharmus, in his Muses, enumerates the ellops among the
                  fishes, but passes over the the callicthys or callionymus in silence as being

                  But the pompilus is a very amorous animal; as being sprung himself, at the same

                     some old fisherman once threatened to punish this fish, when the golden age
                     still flourished among men; and his name was Epopeus, and he belonged to the
                     island of Icarus. He therefore was one day fishing with his son, and they had
                     no luck in their fishing, and caught nothing but pompili, and so did not
                     abstain from eating them, but he and his son ate every one of them, and not
                     long afterwards they suffered for their impiety; for a whale attacked the ship,
                     and ate up Epopeus in the sight of his son.</quote> And Pancrates states, "that
                  the pompilus is an enemy to the dolphin; and even the dolphin does not escape with
                  impunity when he has eaten a pompilus, for he becomes unable to exert himself and
                  tremulous when he has eaten <pb n="v.2.p.445"/> him; and so he gets cast on
                  shore, and is eaten himself by the gulls and cormorants; and he is sometimes, when
                  in this state, caught by men who give themselves up to hunting such large fish.

               <p>Anchovies must be next considered. And, indeed, Aristonymus uses the word in the
                  singular number, in his Shivering Sun— So that there really is not one anchovy.
                  But of the anchovies there are many kinds, and the one which is called
                     aphritis<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφρὸς,</foreign> foam.</note> is not produced from roe, as Aristotle says,
                  but from a foam which floats upon the surface of the water, and which collects in
                  quantities when there have been heavy rains. There is also another kind called
                  cobitis, and that is produced from some little worthless gudgeons which are
                  generated in the sand; and from this anchovy itself another kind is produced,
                  which is called the encrasicholus. There is also another anchovy which is the
                  offspring of the sprat; and another which comes from the membras; and another
                  still which comes from the small cestris, which is engendered in the sand and
                  slime. But of all these kinds the aphritis is the best. But Dorion, in his
                  treatise on Fishes, speaks of a fish called the cobites, as good boiled, and also
                  of the spawn of the atherina; and atherina is the name of a fish; and some also
                  call the triglitis an anchovy. But Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Marriage, enumerates
                  the anchovies among the shrimps or membrades; making a distinction between this
                  and what is called the seed. And Icesius says, <quote>Of the anchovy, there is one
                     sort which is white and very thin and frothy, which some people also call the
                     cobitis. And there is another which is not so clean as that, and which is
                     larger; but the <pb n="v.2.p.448"/> clean and thin one is the better of the
                     two.</quote> And Archestratus the contriver of delicate dishes, says,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Use all anchovies for manure, except</l>

                  It is something like the tench in shape. But Epicharmus in his Hebe's Wedding
                  speaks of a fish which he calls baiones, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>There are also fish called congers. Icesius says that these are coarser than the
                  common eels; and that their flesh is less firm and less nutritious, and that they
                  are very deficient in palatable juice; but still, that they are good for the
                  stomach. But Nicander, the epic poet, in the third book of his Treatise on
                  Dialects, says that they are also called grylli. But Eudoxus, in the sixth book of
                  his Circuit of the Earth, says that there are numbers of congers caught off

                  to be a load for a cart. And Philemon, the comic poet, himself mentioning the
                  extraordinary congers at Sicyon, represents a cook as priding himself on his

               <p>I swear by Minerva that Menecrates the Syracusan himself would not have made such
                  a boast as that, he who was nick-named Jupiter—a man who gave himself airs as
                  being, by his skill in medicine, the only person who could cause man to live.
                  Accordingly he compelled all who came to be cured by him of what is called the
                  sacred disease, to enter into a written agreement that if they recovered they
                  would be his slaves. And they followed him, one wearing the dress of Hercules, and
                  being called Hercules, (and the man who was so called was Nicostratus, an Argive,
                  who had been cured of the sacred disease, and he is mentioned by Ephippus, in his
                  Peltast, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Did not Menecrates call himself a god,</l>
                     <l>And Nicostratus of Argos a second Hercules?)</l>
                  </quote> and another followed him in the dress of Mercury, having on a cloak and
                  bearing a caduceus, and wings besides. As Nicagoras of Zelia did, who also became
                  afterwards the tyrant of his country, as Baton relates in the history of the
                  Tyrants at Ephesus. And Hegesander says that he called Astycreon, who had been
                  cured by him, Apollo. And another of those who had been cured by him, went about
                  with him to his cost, wearing the dress of Aesculapius. But Jupiter Menecrates
                  himself, clad in purple, and having a golden crown upon his head, and holding a
                  sceptre, and being shod with slippers, went about with his chorus of gods. And
                  once, writing to Philip the king, he began his letter thus—</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="34">
               <p>"Menecrates Jupiter to Philip greeting.</p>

                     able, when you please, to put men to death, who are in health.; but I am able
                     to save those who are sick, and to cause those who are in good health, if they
                     only follow my advice, to live to old age without being attacked by disease.
                     Therefore the Macedonians attend you as body-guards; but all who wish to live
                     attend me; for I, Jupiter, give them life.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>And so Philip wrote back to him as to a man out of his senses,—<quote>Philip
                     wishes Menecrates soundness.</quote> And he wrote in similar style to
                  Archidemus, also the king of the Lacedæmonians, and to every one else to whom he
                  wrote at all; never omitting to give himself the name of Jupiter. And once Philip
                  invited him and all his gods to supper, and <pb n="v.2.p.455"/> placed them all
                  on the centre couch, which was adorned in the loftiest and most holy-looking and
                  beautiful manner. And he had a table placed before them on which there was an
                  altar and first-fruits of the different productions of the earth. And whenever
                  eatables were placed before the other guests, the slaves placed incense before
                  Menecrates, and poured libations in his honour. And at last, the new Jupiter, with
                  all his subordinate gods, being laughed at by every one, ran away and fled from
                  the banquet, as Hegesander relates. And Alexis also makes mention of Menecrates in

                  proclaimed in the public assemblies, <quote>Themiso, the Macedonian, the Hercules
                     of Antiochus the king;</quote> but all the people of that country used to
                  sacrifice to him, addressing him as Hercules Themiso; and he himself would come

                  bow, and in his hand he carried a club. Menecrates then himself, though he was
                  such as we have said, never made such a preposterous boast as the cook we have

                     <l>First I did take some squills, and fried them all;</l>

                     <l>To boil in pickle with all sorts of herbs.</l>
                     <l>Avoiding all such roasts as want a spit,</l>

                     <l>I bought too some fine mullet, and young thrushes,</l>

                     <l>Though I did stuff them all with a rich forced meat</l>
                     <l>Of almost every kind of herb and flower.</l>
                     <l>Then there were several dishes of boil'd meats,</l>
                     <l>And sauce-boats full of oil and vinegar.</l>
                     <l>Besides all this a conger fine and fat</l>
                     <l>I bought, and buried in a fragrant pickle;</l>
                     <l>Likewise some tench, and clinging to the rocks</l>
                     <l>Some limpets. All their heads I tore away,</l>
                     <l>And cover'd them with flour and bread crumbs over,</l>
                     <l>And then prepared them as I dress'd the squills.</l>
                     <l>There was a widow'd amia too, a noble</l>
                     <l>And dainty fish. That did I wrap in fig-leaves,</l>

                     <l>With swaddling clothes of marjoram did I fold it,</l>
                     <l>And hid it like a torch beneath the ashes.</l>
                     <l>With it I took anchovies from Phalerum,</l>

               <p>There is a kind of shark called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλεὸς,</foreign> which is
                  eaten. And Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says that the best and tenderest
                  kind of galei are those called asteriæ. But Aristotle says that there are many
                  kinds of them—the thorny, the smooth, the spotted, the young galeus, the fox
                  shark, and the file shark. But Dorion, in his Book on Fishes, says that the fox
                  shark has only one fin towards his tail, but has none along the ridge of his back.
                  But Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, says that the centrines
                  is also a kind of shark, and also the notidanus. But Epænetus, in his Cookery
                  Book, calls the latter the enotideus, and says <quote>that the centrines is very
                     inferior to him, and that it has a bad smell; and that the one may be
                     distinguished from the other by the fact of the centrines having a sort of spur
                     on his first fin, while the rest of the kinds have not got such a
                     thing.</quote>
                  <quote>And he says that these fishes have no fat or suet in them, because they are
                     cartilaginous.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>And the acanthias, or thorny shark, has this peculiarity, that his heart is
                  five-cornered. And the galeus has three young at most; and it receives its young
                  into his mouth, and immediately ejects them again; and the variegated galeus is
                  especially fond of doing this, and so is the fox shark. But the other kinds do not
                  do so, because of the roughness of the skins of the young ones.</p>

               <p>But Archestratus, the man who lived the life of Sardanapalus, speaking of the
                  galeus as he is found at Rhodes, says that it is the same fish as that which,
                  among the Romans, is brought on the table to the music of flutes, and accompanied
                  with crowns, the slaves also who carry it being <pb n="v.2.p.462"/> crowned, and
                  that it is called by the Romans accipesius. But the accipesius, the same as the
                  acipenser, or sturgeon, is but a small fish in comparison, and has a longer nose,
                  and is more triangular than the galeus in his shape. And the very smallest and
                  cheapest galeus is not sold at a lower price than a thousand Attic drachmæ.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">An Attic drachma was as near as may be 9

                  that the accipesius is the fish called the ellops by the Greeks. But Archestratus,
                  speaking of the Rhodian galeus, counselling his companions in a fatherly sort of
                  way, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  he says that Theseus; who I take to have been some very good-looking man, offered
                  to indulge Thepolemus in anything if he would only give him one of these fish. And

                  of Scione. And he makes particular mention of this herb, namely, that any one who
                  eats of it becomes immortal, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And Nicander, in the third book of his Europe, says that Glaucus was
                  beloved by Nereus. And the same Nicander, in the first book of his history of the
                  Affairs of Aetolia, says that Apollo learnt the art of divination from Glaucus;
                  and that Glaucus when he was hunting near Orea, (and that is a lofty mountain in
                  Aetolia,) hunted a hare, which was knocked up by the length of the chance, and got
                  under a certain fountain, and when just on the point of dying, rolled itself on
                  the herbage that was growing around; and, as it recovered its strength by means of
                  the herbage, Glaucus too perceived the virtues of this herb, and ate some himself.
                  And becoming a god in consequence, when a storm came, he, in accordance with the
                  will of Jupiter, threw himself into the sea. But Hedylus, whether he was a Samian
                  or an Athenian I know not, says that Glaucus was enamoured of Melicert, and threw
                  himself into the sea after him. But Hedyl, the mother of this poet, and daughter
                  of Moschine of Atica, a <pb n="v.2.p.466"/> poetess who composed Iambics, in her
                  poem which is entitled Scylla, relates that Glaucus being in love with Scylla came

                  extols the Copaic eels highly; and they grow to a great size. At all events,
                  Agatharchides, in the sixth book of his history of the Affairs of Europe, says
                  that the largest eels from lake Copais are sacrificed to the gods by the Bœotians,
                  who crown them like victims, and offer prayers over them, sprinkling them with
                  meal; and that once, when a foreigner was astonished at the singular kind of
                  victim and sacrifice, and asked a Bœotian whence it originated, the Bœotian
                  answered, That he only knew one thing; that it was right to maintain the customs
                  of one's ancestors, and that it was not right to make any excuses for them to
                  foreigners. But we need not wonder if eels are sacrificed as victims, since
                  Antigonus the Carystian, in his treatise on Language, says that the fishermen
                  celebrate a festival in honour of Neptune when the tunnies come in season, and
                  they are successful in their pursuit of them; and that they sacrifice to the god
                  the first tunny that is caught; and that this sacrificial festival is called the

               <p>But among the people of Phaselis, even salt-fish are offered in sacrifice. At all
                  events, Heropythus, in his Annals of the Colophonians, speaking of the original
                  settlement of Phaselis, says that <quote>Lacius, having conducted the colony, gave
                     as the price of the ground to Cylabras, a shepherd who fed sheep there, some
                     salt-fish, as that was what he asked for. For when Lacius had proposed to him
                     to take as a price for <pb n="v.2.p.467"/> the soil either barley-cakes, or
                     wheat-cakes, or salt-fish, Cyla- bras chose the salt-fish. And, on this
                     account, the people of Phaselis every year, even to this day, sacrifice
                     salt-fish to Cylabras.</quote> But Philostephanus, in the first book of his
                  treatise on the Cities of Asia, writes thus:—<quote>That Lacius the Argive, being
                     one of the men who had come with Mopsus, whom some say was a Lindian, and the
                     brother of Antiphemus who colonized Gela, was sent to Phaselis by Mopsus with
                     some men, in accordance with some directions given by Manto the mother of
                     Mopsus, when the sterns of their ships came in collision off the Chelidoniæ,
                     and were much broken, as Lacius and the vessels with him ran into them in the
                     night, in consequence of their arriving later. And it is said that he purchased
                     the land where the city now stands, in obedience to the prophetic directions of
                     Manto, from a man of the name of Cylabras, giving him some salt-fish for it;
                     for that was what he had selected from all the ships contained. On which
                     account, the people of Phaselis sacrifice salt-fish to Cylabras every year,

               <p>But concerning eels, Icesius, in his treatise on Materials, says that eels have a
                  better juice in them than any other fish; and in the quality of being good for the
                  stomach, they are superior to most, for they are very satisfying and very
                  nutritious: though he classes the Macedonian eels among the salt-fish. But
                  Aristotle says that eels are fond of the very purest water; on which account, the
                  people who feed eels pour clean water over them; for they get choked in muddy
                  water. For which reason, those who hunt for them make the water muddy, in order
                  that the eels may be choked; for, having very small gills, their pores are almost
                  immediately stopped up by any mud or disturbance in the water: on which account,
                  also, they are often choked during storms, when the water is disturbed by heavy
                  gales. But they propagate their species being entwined together, and then they
                  discharge a sort of viscous fluid from their bodies, which lies in the mud and
                  generates living creatures. And the people who feed eels say that they feed by
                  night, but that during the day they remain motionless in the mud; and they live
                  about eight years at most. But in other places, Aristotle ells us again, that they
                  are produced without either their progenitors laying eggs or bringing forth living
                  offspring, and also that <pb n="v.2.p.468"/> they are not generated by any
                  copulation, but that they are propagated by the putrefaction which takes place in
                  the mud and slime—as it is said of those things which are called the entrails of
                  the earth. From which circumstance, he says that Homer distinguishes between their
                  nature and that of other fish; and says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>The tunny must also not be forgotten. Aristotle says this fish swims into the
                  Black Sea, always keeping the land on the right; but that he sails out again,
                  keeping the land on the left. For that he can see much best with his right eye,
                  but that he is rather blind with his left eye. And under his fins he has a sort of
                  gadfly; he delights in heat, on which account he comes wherever there is sand; and
                  he is most eatable at the season when he gets rid of that fly. But he propagates
                  his species after his time of torpor is over, as we are told by Theophrastus; and
                  as long as his offspring are little, he is very difficult to catch, but when they
                  get larger, then he is easily caught, because of the gadfly. But the tunny lies in
                  holes, although he is a fish with a great deal of blood. And Archestratus says—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But Antigonus the Carystian, in his treatise on Language, says that the tunny is
                  sacrificed to Neptune, as we have already mentioned. But Heracleon the Ephesian
                  says that the Attic writers call the tunny the orcynus. And Sostratus, in the
                  second book of his treatise on Animals, says that the pelamys is called the
                  thunnis, or female tunny-fish; but that when it becomes larger, it is called
                  thunnus; and when it gets to a larger size still, it is called the orcynus; and
                  that when it has grown to a size which is quite enormous, then it is called cetus.
                  And Aeschylus likewise mentions the tunny, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I bid you take up hammers now, and beat</l>
                     <l>The fiery mass of iron, which will utter</l>
                     <l>No groan, but bear in silence like the tunny.</l>
                  </quote> And in another place he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Turning his eye aside, just like the tunny;</l>
                  </quote> because the tunny cannot see well out of his left eye, as Aristotle has
                  said. Menander, in his Fishermen, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And the disturbed and muddy sea which breeds</l>
                     <l>The largest tunnies.</l>

                  fish which is usually called <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύννος,</foreign> the Attic

               <p>But as to the thunnis, Aristotle says that this is the female, differing from the
                  male thunnus in having a fin under the belly, the name of which fin is the
                     <quote>ather.</quote> But in his treatise on the Parts of Animals, he again
                  distinguishes the thunnis from the thunnus; saying, that <quote>in the summer,
                     about the month Hecatombæon, it drops something like a bag, in which there are
                     a great number of small eggs.</quote> And Speusippus, in the second book of his
                  Similitudes, distin- guishes the thunnis from the thunnus; and so does Epichar-
                  mus, in his Muses. But Cratinus, in his Pluti, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  petty details, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>There is also a fish called the hippurus, or horsetail. Aristotle, in the fifth

                  that these are small at first, but come to a great size, like those of the lam-
                  prey; and that they bring forth their young in the spring. But Dorion, in his book
                  upon Fish, says that the hippurus is also called the coryphæna. But Icesius calls
                  it the hippuris; and Epicharmas also mentions them in his Hebe's Wedding, saying—

                  nature of the fish, says that it keeps continually leaping out of the water; on
                  which account it is also called the Tumbler. And he uses the following expressions
                  about it:— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>There is also the cestreus. Icesius says, <quote>if the fish which are called by
                     one general name of leucisci there are many sorts; for some are called cephali,
                     and some cestres, and some chellones, and some myxini. But the cephali are the
                     best both in flavour and juiciness; the next to them are those called the
                     cestres; the myxini are inferior to either. But the worst of all are the
                     chellones, which are called bacchi; and they are all full of wholesome juice,
                     not very nutritious, but very digestible.</quote> And Dorion, in his essay on
                  Fish, mentions the sea cestreus, but does not approve of the river one. And the
                  sea cestreus he subdivides into two species—the cephalus and the nestis. But the
                  cestreus, which is like the sea-urchin about the head, he calls sphondylus. And he
                  says <quote>that the cephalinus differs from the cephalus, and that this last is
                     also called the blepsias.</quote> But Aristotle says, in the fifth book of his
                  treatise on the Parts of Animals, <quote>But of the different kinds of cestreus,
                     the chellones begin to be pregnant in the month Poseideon; so does the sargus
                     and the fish called the myxus; and so does the cephalus: and they go thirty
                     days with young. But some of the cestres are not generated by copulation, but
                     are produced by the slime and the sand.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>And in other places Aristotle says, <quote>The cestreus is a fish with serrated
                     teeth, but he does not eat other fishes; and, indeed, he is in no respect
                     carnivorous. But of these fish there are several kinds—the cephalus, the
                     chellon, and the pheræus. And the chellon feeds close to land, but the pheræus
                     does not; and they use the following food—the pheræus uses the mucus which
                     proceeds from itself, and the chellon eats slime and sand. It is said, also,
                     that the spawn of the cestreus is not eaten by any other fish, just as the
                     cestreus also eats no other fish.</quote> But Euthydemus the Athenian, in his
                  treatise on Cured Fish, says that the spheneus and the dactyleus are both
                  different species of cestres; and also that there is a species which are called
                  cephali, because they have very large heads. And those which are called
                     spheneus,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφὴν,</foreign> a wedge.</note> are called so because <pb n="v.2.p.482"/>
                  they are thin and four-cornered; and the dactyleis are not so thick as two
                  fingers. But the most excellent of the cestres are those which are caught near
                  Abdera, as Archestratus has told us; and the second-best are those which come from
                  Sinope.</p>

               <p>But the cestres are called by some writers plotes, as Polemo says, in his treatise
                  on the Rivers in Sicily. And Epicharmus, in his Muses, gives them this name—

                  </quote> And Aristotle, in his treatise on the Dispositions and Way of Living of
                  Animals, says that <quote>the cestres live even if they are deprived of their
                     tails. But the cestreus is eaten by the pike, and the conger is eaten by the
                     turbot.</quote> And there is an often-quoted proverb, <quote>The cestreus is
                     fasting,</quote> which is applied to men who live with strict regard to
                  justice, because the cestreus is never carnivorous. Anaxilas, in his Morose Man,
                  attacking Maton the Sophist for his gluttony, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Maton seized hold of a large cestreus' head,</l>

                  sacrifice some, absolutely abstain altogether from fish alone. Is it because of
                  their silence for they think silence a very divine quality. Since, then, you, O
                  you Molossian dogs, are always silent, but are still not Pythagoreans, we will now

               <p>There is a fish called the coracinus. The coracini, which are caught at sea, says
                  Icesius, contain but little nourishment; but they are easily secreted, and have a
                  moderate supply of good juice. But Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of
                  Animals, says that <quote>it happens to nearly all fish to have a rapid growth,
                     and this is the case, in no small degree, with the coracinus; and he lays his
                     eggs close to the land, in places full of weeds and moss.</quote> But
                  Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Similitudes, says that the
                  blacktail and the coracinus are much alike. But Numenius, in his Treatise on the

                  same as coracini. For Epicharmus says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But, in his Hebe's Marriage, he speaks of the æoliæ as a different fish;

                  has said much the same thing; and so has Philotimus, in his Cookery Book. But that
                  the saperdas and the coracinus are both called the platistacus is affirmed by
                  Parmeno the Rhodian, in the first book of his Culinary Doctrine. But Aristophanes,
                  in his Telmessians, uses the expression <quote>black-finned coracini.</quote>

               <p>Pherecrates also uses the word in its diminutive form, in his Forgetful Man, where

                  never ceasing. But the Alexandrians call them plataces, which is, more correctly

               <p>There is also the pike. These, as Aristotle reports, are a solitary and
                  carnivorous fish; and they have a bony <pb n="v.2.p.488"/> tongue, adhering to
                  the mouth, and a triangular heart. But, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals,
                  he says that they bring forth their young, like the cestres and chrysophryes do,
                  chiefly in those places where rivers fall into the sea; and they bring forth in
                  winter, and they also bring forth twice in the season. But Icesius says that the
                  pike is very juicy, and not very nutritious; and that it is also not very easily
                  secreted; but for delicacy of flavour it is accounted the very first of fish. And
                  this fish has his name, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάβραξ,</foreign> from his voracity

                  shrewdness he is superior to other fish, being very ingenious at devising means to
                  save himself; on which account, Aristophanes the comic poet says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  different coracini (for the are many different kinds of this fish). It also
                  produces the fish called the mæotes, which are mentioned by Archippus, in his
                  Fishes, in these words:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Mæotæ, and saperdæ, likewise glanides.</l>
                  </quote> And this fish is found in great numbers in Pontus; and they derive their
                  name from the Palus Mæotis. But the following, as far as I can recollect, from
                  having been a long time absent <pb n="v.2.p.490"/> from the country, are the
                  names of the chief fish found in the Nile. The sweetest of all is the ray; then
                  there is the sea-pig, the snub-nose, the phagrus, the oxyrhynchus, the allabes,
                  the silurus, the synodontis, the elecoris, the eel, the thrissa, the abramis, the
                  blind-fish, the scaly-fish, the bellows-fish, and the cestreus. And there are also
                  a great number of others.</p>

               <p>There is also the lamprey. Theophrastus, in the fifth book of his treatise on
                  those Animals which can live on dry Land, says that the eel and the lamprey can
                  exist for a long time out of the water, because they have very small gills, and so
                  receive but very little moisture into their system. But Icesius affirms that they
                  are not less nutritious than the eel, nor even, perhaps, than the conger. And
                  Aristotle, in his treatise on the Parts of Animals, says that from the time that
                  they are little they grow very rapidly, and that they have sharp serrated teeth;
                  and that they keep on laying small-sized eggs every season of the year. But
                  Epicharmus, in his Muses, calls them not <foreign xml:lang="grc">σμύραινα,</foreign>

                  one spine, like the kind of cod which is called gallarias. But Andreas, in his
                  treatise on Poisonous Animals, says that those lampreys which are produced by a
                  cross with the viper have a poisonous bite, and that that kind is less round than
                  the other, and is variegated. But Nicander, in his Theriacus, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  says that it is quite a mistake to suppose that the lamprey ever breeds with the
                  viper when it comes on marshy ground; for that vipers do not themselves feed in
                  marshes, as they are fond rather of sandy and desert places. But Sostratus, in his
                  books on Animals (and there are two books of his on this subject, and with this
                  title), agrees with those who assert that the lamprey and the viper do breed

               <p>There is another kind of eel also, called the myrus. But the myrus, as Aristotle
                  says, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, differs from the
                  lamprey; this latter being a variegated fish, and less powerful than the other;
                  while the myrus is a fish of one uniform colour, and strong, and its whole colour
                  is like that of the wryneck, and it has teeth both within and without. And Dorion
                  says, that the myrus has no small bones running through its flesh, but that it is
                  in every part eatable, and exceedingly soft; and that there are two kinds of it,
                  for some are black, and some are of rather a fiery colour, but those which are

                  also in the extent to which they facilitate the secretions of the stomach. But
                  Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things similar to one another,

                  Icesius says that it is a fish without much nutriment or much juice in it, but
                  that it has some cartilaginous sort of substance diffused all over it, very good
                  for the stomach. And Theophrastus, in his book on Animals which live in Holes,
                  says that the torpedo works its way underground because of the cold. But in his
                  treatise on Poisonous Animals, and on Animals which sting, he says that the
                  torpedo can send the power which proceeds from it through wood, and through
                  harpoons, so as to produce torpor in those <pb n="v.2.p.494"/> who have them in
                  their hands. But Clearchus the Solensian has explained the cause of this in his
                  treatise on Torpor; but, since his explanation is rather a long one, I do not
                  recollect his exact words, but will refer you to the treatise itself.</p>
               <p>But the torpedo, says Aristotle, is one of the cartilaginous and viviparous fish;
                  and, to provide itself with food, it hunts after little fish, touching them, and
                  causing them all to become torpid and motionless. And Diphilus of Laodicea, in his
                  essay on the Theriaca of Nicander, says that it is not every part of the animal
                  which produces this torpor, but only some particular parts of it; and he says that
                  he has arrived at this fact by a long series of experiments. But Archestratus
                  speaks of– <quote rend="blockquote">

                  but the word is also spelt with an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρφος</foreign>), as Pamphilus tells us. But Aristotle, in the
                  fifth book of his Parts of Animals, where he says that the growth of most fish is
                  very rapid, says, “The orphos also grows to a large fish from a little one with
                  great rapidity; but he is a carnivorous fish, with serrated teeth, and of a
                  solitary disposition. And there is this peculirity in him, that it cannot be
                  ascertained what means he has of propagating his species, and that he can live a
                  long time after he has been cut in pieces. He is also one of those fish which bury
                  themselves in holes during the winter season, and he is fond of keeping close to
                  the land, rather than of going into the deep sea; but he does not live more than
                  two years. And Numenius, speaking of this fish, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Now with such baits as these it is not hard</l>
                     <l>To draw the lengthy scorpion from his bed,</l>
                     <l>Or the rough orphus: for they're easily caught.</l>
                  </quote> And in another place he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Or the dark flesh'd sea-blackbird.</l>
                  </quote> But Dorion says that the young orphus is called by some the orphacines.
                  And Archippus says, in his Fishes,— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  quoted; and Cratinus also, in his Uysses, as I have above quoted it, writes—

               <p>There is also a fish called orcynus. Dorion, in his treatise on Fishes, says that
                  the orcyni come from the sea near the Pillars of Hercules to the: waters on our
                  costs; on <pb n="v.2.p.496"/> which account, a great number are taken in the
                  Iberian and Tyrrhenian seas; and that from thence they are dispersed over the rest
                  of the sea. But Icesius says that those which are caught near Cadiz are the
                  fattest, and next to them those which are taken near Sicily. But that those which
                  are taken at any great distance from the Pillars of Hercules have very little fat
                  on them, because they have swum a very great distance. Accordingly, at Cadiz, it
                  is only the shoulders by themselves which are dried and cured; as also it is only
                  the jaws and palate of the sturgeon, and that part which is called the melandryas,
                  which is cured. But Icesius says that the entrails are very rich, and very
                  different in flavour from the other parts; and that the parts about the shoulders
                  are superior even to these.</p>

               <p>There is also the cod and the hake. The cod, says Aristotle, in his work on Living
                  Animals, has a large wide mouth like the shark, and he is not a gregarious fish;
                  and he is the only fish which has his heart in his stomach, and in his brain he
                  has stones like millstones. And he is the only fish who buries himself in a hole
                  in the hot weather, when the Dog-star rages; for all others take to their holes in
                  the winter season. And these fish are mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Hebe's
                  Wedding:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And there are channel with their large wide mouths,</l>

                  </quote> But the cod is different from the hake, as Dorion tells us, in his work
                  upon Fish, where he writes thus: <quote>The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνος</foreign>

                  </quote> There is also the gallerides, which some call a hake, and some a maxinus.
                  But Euthydemus, in his work on Cured Fish, says, <quote>Some call this fish the
                     bacchus, and some call it the gelaria, and some call it the hake.</quote> But

                     molluscous fish are calculated to give pleasure, and to excite the amorous
                     propensities; especially the polypi (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ
                        πολύποδες</foreign>).</quote> And Aristotle relates that the polypus has
                  eight feet, of which the two highest and the two lowest are the smallest, and
                  those in the middle are the largest; and they have also two feelers, with which
                  they bring their food to their mouth. And they have their eyes placed above their
                  two upper feet; and their mouth and teeth are between their feet. And when the
                  polypus is dissected, he has a brain divided into two parts; and what is called
                  his ink is not black, like the cuttle-fish, but of a reddish colour, in that part
                  of him which is called the poppy; but the poppy lies above the stomach, like a
                  bladder: and it has no intestines, like other fish. But for food it uses at times
                  the flesh of small shell-fish, and casts the shells outside its body; by which the
                     <pb n="v.2.p.498"/> hunters know where to find it. And it propagates its
                  species by becoming intertwined with the female, and is a long time about it,
                  because it is destitute of blood: and it ejects its young through the orifice
                  which is called the spiracle, which is the only passage for its body; and it lays
                  eggs in clusters, like bunches of grapes.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="102">
               <p>They say, also, that the polypus, when it is in want of food, will eat even
                  itself. And among those who relate this fact is Pherecrates the comic poet; for
                  he, in the play entitled The Countryman, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>They live on green anthrysca, and on bracana,</l>
                     <l>And snails and slugs. And when they're very hungry,</l>
                     <l>Then, like the polypus, they e'en at night</l>
                     <l>Nibble their fingers.</l>
                  </quote> And Diphilus, in his Merchant, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>A polypus with all his feelers</l>
                     <l>And limbs unhurt; whose wicked tooth</l>

                  </quote> But all this is a mistake; for the fact is, that he is pursued by the
                  congers, and has his feet hurt in that manner. And it is said that if any one
                  strews salt over his hole, he immediately comes out. It is also affirmed, that
                  when he flies in alarm, he changes his colour, and becomes like the places in
                  which he conceals himself. As also Theognis of Megara says, in his Elegies— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Remark the tricks of that most wary polypus,</l>
                     <l>Who always seems of the same colour and hue</l>

                  </quote> And Clearchus makes a similar statement in the second book of his

                  whose writings they come— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And the same Clearchus says that, in olden time, about Trœzen, it was considered
                  impious to try to catch either the polypus, which was called sacred, or that one
                  which was called the rower. And it was contrary to law to eat either that or the
                  sea-tortoise. But the polypus is a fish very apt to decay, and also very stupid;
                  for it goes towards the hand of the people who are pursuing it: and sometimes even
                     <pb n="v.2.p.499"/> when it is pursued, it does not attempt to get out of the
                  way. Their females waste away after laying their eggs, and get powerless; by
                  reason of which they are easily taken. And sometimes they have been seen leaving
                  the sea, and going on dry land, especially towards any rough or rugged ground; for
                  they shun smooth places: and of all plants they especially delight in the olive,
                  and they are often found embracing the trunk of an olive with their feelers. They
                  have also been discovered clinging to such fig-trees as grow near the seashore,
                  and eating the figs, as Clearchus tells us, in his treatise on those Animals which
                  live in the Water. And this also is a proof that they are fond of the olive,—that
                  if any one drops a branch of this tree down into the sea, in a place where there
                  are polypi, and holds it there a little time, he without any trouble draws up as
                  many polypi as he pleases, clinging to the branch. And all their other parts are
                  exceedingly strong, but their neck is weak.</p>

               <p>It is also said that the male has something corresponding to the parts of
                  generation of one of his arms, in which there are his two large feelers; and that
                  it is a limb full of nerves, sticking to the arm all along as far as the middle.
                  But, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, Aristotle
                     says—<quote>The polypus propagates his species in the winter, and brings forth
                     in the spring; and it lies in its hole for about two months: and it is a very
                     prolific animal. But the male differs from the female, both in having a longer
                     head, and also in having what the fishermen call its parts of generation in one
                     of its feelers. And when it brings forth, it sits on its eggs, on which account
                     it is worse to eat at that season; and the polypus lays its eggs either in its
                     bed, or in any potsherd, or hollow place or vessel of that sort. And after
                     fifty days, the little polypi come forth out of the egg in immense numbers,
                     like young spiders. But the female polypus sometimes sits upon the eggs, and
                     sometimes clings to the mouth of the bed, holding on with one of its
                     feelers.</quote> Theophrastus, in his treatise on those Animals which change
                  their Colour, says that the polypus generally becomes like only to those places
                  which are rocky, doing this both out of fear and for the sake of protecting
                  itself. But, in his book on those Animals which live on dry Land, he says that the
                  polypi are not fond of sea-water. But, in his treatise on those Things which are
                  different according to the Differences of their <pb n="v.2.p.500"/> Situation,
                  Theophrastus says that there are no polypi about the Hellespont; for that that sea
                  is cold, and not very salt, and that both these circumstances are unfavourable to
                  the polypus.</p>

                     which have a thin membrane growing between them, just as the feet of some birds
                     are which have a membrane of skin between their toes. And their other two
                     feelers they let down into the sea, instead of rudders; but when they see
                     anything coming towards them, then out of fear they draw in those feet, and
                     fill themselves with salt water, and so descend to the bottom as rapidly as

                  scombrus is smaller in size, but more nutritious, than the species called colias;
                  and also more juicy, though not more easily digested. Epicharmus, in his Hebe's
                  Wedding, mentions them thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Sea-swallows, and mormyri, both of which</l>
                     <l>Are larger than the coliæ and the scombri,</l>
                     <l>But less than those whose name is thynnides.</l>

               <p>The sargus is another fish. He (as Icesius tells us) is a fish of very exciting
                  and astringent properties, and more nutritious than the melanurus, or blacktail.
                  But Numenius, in his treatise on Fishing, says that the sargus is a very cunning
                  fish as respects the catching him:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>The greatest enemy to the fisher's nets.</l>
                  </quote> And Aristotle, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals,
                  says that the sargus brings forth its young twice in the year; once in the spring
                  and once in the autumn. And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδία, ταινία, οἰκία.</foreign> But Aristotle says that
                  the cuttle-fish has eight feet, of which the two lowest are the largest; and that
                  it has two proboscises, and between them it has its eyes and mouth placed. And it
                  has two teeth, one above and one below; and what is called a shell on its back.
                  And the ink is contained in what is called the mutis, which answers to the liver;
                  and it lies near its mouth, being something like a bladder. Its belly is wide and
                  smooth, like the paunch of an ox. And the little cuttle-fish feed on small fish,
                  extending their proboscises like fishermen's lines, and catching their prey with
                  them. It is said, too, that when a storm comes, they seize hold of the rocks with
                  their proboscises, as if they were anchors, and so fix themselves firm. And when
                  the cuttle-fish is pursued, it discharges its ink, and is hidden in it, making it
                  appear as if it were flying forwards. And it is also said, that when the female is
                  struck by a harpoon, the male fish come to its assistance, dragging it on; but if
                  the male fish be taken, the female fish flees away. But the cuttlefish does not
                  live more than a year, as neither does the polypus. But, in the fifth book of his
                  Parts of Animals, Aristotle says—<quote>The cuttle-fish and the squids swim
                     together, being united together at the mouths, and also touching one another
                     with their feelers, so as to join in that manner; and they also join proboscis
                     to proboscis. But of all the molluscous fish, the cuttle-fish is the earliest
                     in the spring to bring forth its young; and they do not bring forth at every
                     season. But they go with young fifteen days; and when they lay their eggs, the
                     male follows the female, and breathes upon the eggs and makes them firm. And
                     they move in pairs; and the male is more variegated than the female, and
                     blacker on the back.</quote>

                     ὑπόσφαγμα,</foreign> the interpreters have explained the expression as meaning
                     <quote>the ink of the cuttle-fish.</quote> But the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόσφαγμα</foreign> is, properly speaking, equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπότριμμα,</foreign> a dish compounded of various ingredients, as Erasistratus
                  tells us, in his Cookery Book. And he writes as follows—<quote>But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόσφαγμα</foreign> is made with roast meat and blood stirred
                     up and compounded with cheese, and salt, and cummin, and assafœtida; but the
                     meat may also be boiled.</quote> And Glaucus the Locrian, in his Cookery Book,

               <p>The next fish is the mullet; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίγλη</foreign> is like

                  Parts of Animals, says that the mullet brings forth three times in the year; and
                  states that the fishermen have adopted this opinion from the spawn being seen
                  three times a-year in certain localities. And perhaps it is from the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρὶς</foreign> (three times) that it has its name; just as the
                  fish called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμία</foreign> has its name <pb n="v.2.p.511"/>
                  from its being a fish which does not go about by itself, but in shoals (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅμα</foreign>). And the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκάρος</foreign> is
                  so called from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκαίρω</foreign> (to leap); as also is the
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρίς.</foreign> And the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφύη</foreign> is so named as being <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφυὴς,</foreign>
                  which is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυσφυὴς,</foreign> that is to say,
                  slowly propagated. Then <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύννος</foreign> has its name from
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύω</foreign> (to rush), because it is an impetuous fish,
                  from being driven about by its fly in the head at the time of the rising of the
                  Dog-star. But it is a fish with serrated teeth, gregarious, and spotted all over,
                  and also carnivorous: and when it has had young three times it becomes barren; for
                  some little worms are engendered in its womb, which devour the young as soon as
                  they are conceived. And from the actual facts, Epicharmus calls them hump-backed,
                  in his Hebe's Wedding, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But Diocles, in his books addressed to Plistarchus, says that the mullet
                  is a fish of hard flesh; and Speusippus says that the sea-cuckoo, the sea-swallow,
                  and the mullet are all alike; on which account Tryphon says, in his treatise on
                  Animals, that some people think that the trigola is the sea-cuckoo, from its
                  likeness to it, and from the dryness of its hindquarters; which Sophron indicates,
                  when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>For it is sacred to the chaste Diana,</l>
                     <l>And all excitement hates.</l>
                  </quote> But the mullet is attributed to Hecate as her fish, on account of the
                  common derivation of their names; for Hecate is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριοδῖτις,</foreign> as presiding over places where three roads met, and
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίγληνος,</foreign> as having three eyes; and also they
                  provide her a banquet on the thirtieth day of each month (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῖς τριακάσι</foreign>). <pb n="v.2.p.512"/> And, on similar principles,
                  they assign to Apollo the fish <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίθαρος,</foreign> from
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιθάρα</foreign> (the harp); and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βόαξ</foreign> to Mercury, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοάω</foreign> (to speak); and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιττὸς</foreign> to
                  Bacchus, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσὸς</foreign>(ivy); and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάλαρις</foreign> to Venus, as Aristophanes in his Birds says,
                  from the similarity of its name to the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαλλός.</foreign> And so the bird called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῆσσα</foreign> (or duck), they call Neptune's bird; and the sea production
                  which we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφυὰ,</foreign> and others <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφρύα,</foreign> and which is more generally called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφρὸς</foreign> (foam), they also give to him; though they say
                  that this also is very dear to Venus, because she herself was born of foam. But
                  Apollodorus, in his books concerning the Gods, says that the mullet is sacrificed
                  to Hecate on account of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίμορφος,</foreign> of a triple form. But Melanthus, in
                  his treatise on the Eleusinian Mysteries, says that both the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίγλη</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαινὶς</foreign> (or sprat),
                  are sacred to Hecate, because Hecate is also a goddess of the sea. But Hegesander
                  the Delphian says that the mullet is accustomed to be carried about in the
                  Artemisia, because it is accustomed diligently to hunt out and destroy the
                  sea-hares, which are poisonous animals; on which account, as it does this to the
                  great benefit of mankind, the mullet as a huntress is considered sacred to the
                  goddess who is also a huntress. And Sophron has called the mullet
                     <quote>bearded,</quote> because those which have beards are better flavoured
                  than those which have not. And there is a place at Athens called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίγλα,</foreign> and there there is a shrine to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ʽἑκάτη τριγανθίνη; </foreign> on which account Chariclides, in his
                  Chain, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Terpsicles tells us in his book on Amatory Pleasures. And if a woman drinks this
                  same wine, she never becomes pregnant. Birds, too, are affected in the same

                  thickest: and the whole body is delicate, and of a more oblong shape than the
                  sepia. And the teuthis also has ink in its mutis, which, however, is not black,
                  but of a pale colour. And its shell is very small, and cartilaginous.</p>
               <p>There is also the teuthus; and the only difference between the teuthus and the

                  one is the largest; and both of them are black, and like a hawk's beak. And when
                  it is slit open, it has a paunch like a pig's paunch. Aristotle, in the fifth book

               <p>We come now to the sea-sparrow. Diodes enumerates this fish among the drier kinds.
                  But Speusippus, in the second book of his Things resembling one another, says that
                  the sea-sparrow and the buglossus and the tænia are very much alike. But
                  Aristotle, in the fifth book of his Parts of Animals, writes—<quote>And in the

               <p>POLYBIUS the Megalopolitan, speaking of the great happiness which exists in
                  Lusitania (and that is a district of Iberia, which the Romans now call Spania), O
                  most excellent. Timocrates, in the thirty-fourth book of his Histories, says that
                  in that country, on account of the excellent temperature of the air, both animals
                  and men are exceedingly prolific; and the fruits, too, in that country never
                  degenerate. <quote>For there are roses there, and white violets, and asparagus,
                     and other flowers and fruits like them, which last nine months in the year; and
                     as for sea-fish, both in abundance, and in excellence, and in beauty, it is
                     very superior to that produced in our seas. And a siclus (this is equal to a
                     medimnus) of barley costs only a drachma; and one of wheat costs nine
                     Alexandrian obols; and a measure of wine costs a drachma; and a moderate-sized
                     kid costs an obol, and so does a hare. And of lambs, the price is three or four
                     obols; and a fat pig, weighing a hundred minæ, costs five drachmæ; and a sheep
                     costs two. And a talent weight of figs costs three obols; and a calf costs five
                     drachmæ, and a draught-ox ten. And the meat of wild animals is scarcely ever
                     valued at any price at all but people throw that in to purchasers into the
                     bargain, or as a present.</quote> But to us, whenever we sup with our excellent
                  friend Laurentius, he makes Rome another Lusitania,—filling us with every sort of
                  good thing every day, receiving us in a most princely manner with the greatest
                  liberality, while we bring nothing from home as our contribution, except our

               <p>Now, as a long discussion had taken place about fish, it was plain that Cynulcus
                  was annoyed at it; and so the excel- lent Democritus, anticipating him, said—But,
                  O you men fish, as Archippus says, you have omitted (for I too must throw in a
                  little contribution of my own) those which are called fossil fishes, which are
                  produced at Heraclea, and near Tium, in Pontus, which is a colony of the
                  Milesians, though Theophrastus gives us an account of them. And this very same
                  philosopher has also told us about those that are congealed in ice the whole
                  winter, so that they have no feeling whatever, and make not the slightest motion,
                  until they are put into the saucepans and boiled. And these fish have this
                  especial peculiarity, which also belongs in some degree to the fish which are
                  called fossil fish in Paphlagonia. For it is said that ditches are dug in those
                  places to an exceeding depth, where no overflow of rivers ever reaches, nor of any
                  other waters whatever; and yet in those ditches there are found living fishes.</p>

               <p>But Mnaseas of Patra, in his Periplus, says that the fish in the river Clitor are
                  not dumb; though Aristotle has stated in writing that the only fishes which have
                  any voice are the scarus and the river-hog. And Philostephanus, who was a Cyrenæan
                  by birth, and a friend of Callimachus, in his treatise on Extraordinary Rivers,
                  says that in the river Aroanius, which flows through Pheneum, there are fish which
                  sing like thrushes, and that they are called the poiciliæ. And Nympho- dorus the
                  Syracusan, in his Voyages, says that there are pike in the river Helorus, and
                  large eels, so tame that they take bread out of the hands of any who bring it to
                  them. And I myself, and very likely many of you too, have seen cestres tamed to
                  the hand in the fountain of Arethusa, near Chalcis; and eels, having silver and
                  golden earrings, taking food from any one who offered it to them, and entrails
                  from the victims, and fresh cheese. And Semus says, in the sixth book of his
                     Delias—<quote>They say that a boy once dipped a ewer into the well, and brought
                     water to some Athenians who were sacri- ficing at Delos, to wash their hands
                     with; and he brought up, as it happened, some fish in the ewer along with the
                     water: and that on this the soothsayers of the Delians told them that they
                     should become the lords of the sea.</quote>

                  says that behind Pyrene, as far as the river Narbo, the whole country is a plain,
                  through which the rivers Illiberis and Rhoscynus proceed, flowing through cities
                  of the same name as themselves, which are inhabited by some of the Celtæ; and in
                  this plain he says that the above-mentioned fossil fish are also found. And he
                  says that the soil of that lain is light, and that a great quantity of the herb
                  agrostis grows in it; and that beneath it, as the soil is sandy for a depth of two
                  or three cubits, the water flows, which wanders away from these rivers; and so the
                  fish, too, leaving the rivers, and proceeding underground, in the course of these
                  erratic underflowings, in quest of food (for they are exceedingly fond of the root
                  of the agrostis), have caused the whole plain to be full of subterranean fish,
                  which people catch when they dig up the plain. <quote>And among the
                     Indians,</quote> says Theophrastus, <quote>there are fish which go forth out of
                     the rivers over the land, and then, leaping back, return again to the water,
                     just like frogs; being in appearance very like the fish which are called

               <p>But I am not ignorant of what Clearchus, the Peripatetic philosopher, has said
                  about what he calls the exoccetus fish, or fish which comes out of the water to
                  sleep, which he mentions in his work entitled A Treatise on Aquatic Animals. For
                  he has said, (and I think that I recollect his exact words, which are as follows,)
                     <quote>The exoccetus fish, which some people call Adonis, has derived its name
                     from constantly taking his rest out of the water. He is rather of a red colour,
                     and from his gills down to his tail he has on each side of his body one white
                     stripe reaching the whole length of his body. And he is round, but not being
                     broad, he is equal in size to the cestrinisci which are found near the shore;
                     and they are as near as may be about eight fingers in length. Altogether he is
                     very like the fish called the sea-goat, except that the latter has a black
                     place under his stomach, which they call the beard of the goat. And the
                     exocœtus is one of the fish which keeps near to the rocks, and spends his life
                     in rocky places. When it is calm weather he springs up with the waves and lies
                     on the rocks for a considerable time, sleeping on the dry land, and turning
                     himself so as to bask in the sun: and then, when he has had sufficient rest, he
                     rolls towards the water again, until the wave, taking him <pb n="v.2.p.526"/>
                     again, bears him with the reflux back into the sea. And when he is awake on the
                     dry land then he is on his guard against those birds which are called
                     pareudistæ, such as the halcyon, the sandpiper, and the helorius, which is a
                     bird like the rail. For these birds in calm weather feed on the dry land, and
                     often attack the exocœtus; but when he sees them at a distance he flies,
                     leaping and panting, until he dives beneath the water.</quote>

                     have no throats, can utter a sound. Such are those which are found near
                     Cleitor, in Arcadia, in the river called Ladon. For they have a voice, and
                     utter a very audible sound.</quote> And Nicolaus, of Damascus, in the hundred

                     after which there appeared in that district some lakes which previously had no
                     existence, and rivers, and other springs which had been opened by the
                     earthquake. Many also which had previously existed disappeared. And such a
                     quantity of additional water, which was brackish and of a seagreen colour,
                     burst up in that district, though it is at a very great distance from the sea,
                     that all the neighbouring country was filled with oysters and fish, and all
                     other productions of the sea.</quote> I know also that it has very often rained
                  fishes. At all events, Phænias, in the second book of his Eresian Magistrates,
                  says that in the Chersonesus it once rained fish uninterruptedly for three days;
                  and Phylarchus, in his fourth book, says that people had often seen it raining
                  fish, and often also raining wheat, and that the same thing has happened with
                  respect to frogs. At all events, Heraclides Lembus, in the twenty-first book of
                  his History, says—<quote>In Pæonia and Dardania it has, they say, before now
                     rained frogs; and so great has been the number of these frogs that the houses
                     and the roads have been full of them; and at first, for some days, the

                     Ptolemais, and when Sarpedon, being defeated, retired into the inland parts of
                     the country with his own troops, but the army of Tryphon, having been

                     all, and destroyed them beneath the waters, and the retreating wave also left
                     an immense heap of fish with the corpses. And Sarpedon and his army heating of
                     what had happened, came up, and were delighted at the sight of the corpses of
                     their enemies, and carried away an enormous quantity of fish, and made a

                  writing in this manner:—<quote>For when they have come to the sea, at a place
                     where there is on the shore a grove sacred to Apollo, and where there is an
                     eddy on the sand, the persons who are consulting the oracle come, bringing with
                     them two wooden spits, having each of them ten pieces of roast meat on them.
                     And the priest sits down by the side of the grove in silence; but he who is
                     consulting the oracle throws the spits into the eddy, and looks on to see what
                     happens. And after he has put the spits in, then the eddy becomes full of salt
                     water, and there comes up such an enormous quantity of fish of such a
                     description that he is amazed at the sight, and is even, as it were, alarmed at
                     the magnitude of it. And when the prophet enumerates the different species of
                     fish, the person who is consulting the oracle in this manner receives the
                     prophecy from the priest respecting the matters about which he has prayed for
                     information. And there appear in the eddy orphi, and sea-grayling, and
                     sometimes some sorts of whales, such as the phalkena, or pristis, and a great
                     many other fish which are rarely seen, and strange to the sight.</quote>

               <p>I know, also, what is related about the fish called apopyris, which is found in
                  the lake Bolbe; concerning which Hegesander, in his Commentaries, speaks
                     thus:—<quote>Around Apollonia of Chalcis two rivers flow, the Ammites and the
                     Olynthiacus, and they both fall into the lake Bolbe. And on the river
                     Olynthiacus there is a monument of Olynthus, the son of Hercules and Bolbe. And
                     in the months Anthesterion and Elaphebolion, the natives say that Bolbe sends
                     Apopyris to Olynthus; and that about this time a most enormous number of fish
                     ascend out of the lake into the river Olynthiacus: and this is a shallow river,
                     scarcely deep enough to wet a man's ankles; but for all that there does not the
                     less come a great number of fish, so that all the people of the district get
                     enough cured fish for their use for the year. And it is a wonderful fact that
                     they never pass above the monument of Olynthus. They say, in explanation of
                     this, that the people of Apollonia did formerly, in the month Elaphebolion,
                     celebrate sacrifices to the dead, but that they do so now in the month
                     Anthesterion; and that on this account this ascent is made by the fish in those
                     months alone in which the natives are accustomed to pay honour to their
                     national heroes.</quote>

                  her, when she was a most respectable woman. And the iambics, in which this is

                  historian. Accordingly Machon, the comic poet, speaks of him as a musician,
                  saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Duris, who wrote the Histories, and made himself tyrant of his country, writes
                  thus in his Apophthegms— <quote>When a man once said to Dorion the flute-player,
                     that the ray was a good fish, he said—' Yes, about as good as if a man were to
                     eat a boiled cloak.' And once, when some one else praised the entrails of
                     tunny-fish, he said—' You are quite right, but then a man must eat them as I
                     eat them;' and when the man asked him how that was, he said—' How? why
                     willingly.' And he said that crawfish had three good qualities,—exercise, good
                     food, and contemplation. And once, at Cyprus, when he was supping with
                     Nicocreon, he praised a goblet that there was there; and Nicocreon
                     said—'Whatever there is here that you fancy, the artist will make you another
                     like it.' 'Let him make that,' he replied, 'for you; but do you give me this
                     one.</quote> ' And this was a clever speech of the flute-player; for there is

                     ordered him to tell him the names of the best fish; and when the boy had
                     counted up the orphus, and the sea-grayling, and the conger, and others of this
                     sort, he said—'I desired you to tell me the names of fishes, and not of
                     gods.'</quote> The same Dorion, ridiculing the description of a tempest in the
                  Nautilus of Timotheus, said that he had seen a more formidable storm in a boiling
                  saucepan. And Aristodemus, in the second book of his Memorials of Laughable
                  Circumstances and Sayings, says —<quote>Dorion the musician was club-footed; and

               <p>I know, too, the sportive sayings which Lasus of Hermione has uttered about
                  fishes; which Chamæleon of Heraclea has recorded in writing, in his book on this
                  very Lasus, where he says—' They say that Lasus called raw fish <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπτὸς</foreign> (which means roasted or visible); and when many
                  people wondered why he did so, he thus began to prove what he had said; arguing
                  thus: 'As whatever a person can hear (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκοῦσαι</foreign>) is
                  properly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκουστὸν,</foreign> and as whatever a person
                  can understand by his intellect (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῆσαι</foreign>) is
                  properly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοητὸν,</foreign> so whatever any one can
                  see (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄπτεσθαι</foreign>) is clearly <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπτόν;</foreign>; as therefore it was possible to see the fish, he evidently
                  was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπτός.ʼ</foreign>.' And once, in a joke, he stole a fish
                  from a fisherman, and having taken it, he gave it to one of the bystanders; and
                  when the fisherman put him to his oath, he swore that he had not got it himself,
                  and that he had not seen any one else take it; because, in fact, he himself had
                  taken it, but some one else had got it. And then he prompted the other man, on the
                  other hand, to swear that he had not taken it himself, and that he was not
                  acquainted with any one else who had it; for, in fact, Lasus had taken it, and he
                  himself had it.” And Epicharmus jests in the same way; as, in his Logus and

               <p>The following people, too, have all been great epicures about fish. Antagoras the
                  poet would not allow his slave to touch his fish with oil, but made him wash it;
                  as Hegesander tells us. And when in the army, he was once boiling a dish of
                  congers, and had his clothes girt round him, Antigonus the king, who was standing
                  by, said, <quote>Tell me, Antagoras, do you think that Homer, who celebrated the
                     exploits of Agamemnon, ever boiled congers</quote> And it is said that he
                  answered, not without wit, <quote>And do you think that Agamemnon, who performed
                     those exploits, ever busied himself about inquiring who was cooking congers in
                     his army?</quote> And once, when Antagoras was cooking a bird of some kind, he
                  said that he would not go to the bath, because he was afraid that the slaves might
                  come and suck up the gravy. And when Philocydes said that his mother would take
                  care of that, <quote>Shall I,</quote> said he, <quote>entrust the gravy of game to
                     my mother?</quote> And Androcydes of Cyzicus, the painter, being very fond of
                  fish, as Polemo relates, carried his luxury to such a pitch that he even painted
                  with great care the fish which are around Scylla.</p>

                     of the name of Glaucus came to this place, bringing from Pontus a kind of
                     shark, a fish of extraordinary magnitude,—a great dainty for epicures in fish,
                     and, in fact, for all men who are devoted to the pleasures of the table. And he
                     brought it on his shoulders, and said, ' Whom shall I instruct how to dress it,
                     and how shall it be dressed? Will you have it soaked in a sauce of green herbs,
                     or shall I baste its body with basting of warm brine, and then dress it on a
                     fierce fire?' And a man named Moschio, a great flute-player, cried out that he
                     should like to eat it boiled in warm pickle-juice. And this was meant as a
                     reproof for you, O Calaides! for you are very fond of figs and cured fish; and
                     yet you will not taste a most exquisite fish which you have served up to you in

                  perhaps concealing under the mention of the cured fish, some intimation of his
                  having been implicated in discreditable conduct. And Hermippus says, in the third
                  book of his treatise on the Pupils of Isocrates, that Hyperides was in the habit

               <p>But Melanthus the tragic poet was a person of the same sort; and he also wrote
                  elegies. But Leucon, in his Men of the same Tribe, cuts his jokes upon him in the
                  fashion of the comic writers, on account of his gluttony; and so does Aristophanes
                  in the Peace, and Pherecrates in his Petale. But Archippus, in his play called The
                  Fishes, having put him in chains as an epicure, gives him up to the fishes, to be
                  eaten by them in retaliation. And, indeed, even Aristippus, the pupil of Socrates,
                  was a great epicure,—a man who was once reproached by Plato for his gluttony, as
                  Sotion ad Hegesander relate. And the Delphian writes thus:—<quote>Aristippus, when
                     Plato reproached him for having bought a number of fish, said that he had
                     bought them for two obols; and when Plato said, 'I myself would have bought
                     them at th t price,' 'You see, then,' said he, '0 Plato! that it is not I who
                     am an epicure, but you who are a miser.'</quote> And Antiphanes, in <pb n="v.2.p.542"/> his Female Flute-player, or the Female Twins, laughing at a

               <p>These, then, are the things, said Democritus, which I myself have brought in the

                  friend Ulpian; who, on account of the national customs of the Syrians, has
                  deprived us of our fish, continually bringing forward one thing after another. And
                  Antipater of Tarsus, the Stoic philosopher, in the fourth book of his treatise on
                  Superstition, tells us that it is said by some people that Gatis, the queen of the

                  one should eat fish without Gatis being invited (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄτερ
                     γάτιδος</foreign>); and that the common people, out of ignorance, thought her
                  name was Atergatis, and abstained wholly from fish. And Mnaseus, in the second
                  book of his History of Asia, speaks thus—<quote>But I think that Atergatis was a
                     very bad queen, and that she ruled the people with great harshness, so that she
                     even forbad them by law to eat fish, and ordered them to bring all the fish to
                     her, because she was so fond of that food; and, on account of this order of
                     hers, a custom still prevails, when the Syrians pray to the goddess, to offer
                     her golden or silver fish; and for the priests every day to place on the table
                     before the god real fish also, carefully dressed, both boiled and roasted,
                     which the priests of the goddess eat themselves.</quote> And a little further
                  on, he says again—<quote>But Atergatis (as Xanthus the Lydian says), being taken
                     prisoner by Mopsus, king of Lydia, was drowned with her son in the lake near
                     Ascalon, because of her insolence, and was eaten up by fishes.</quote>

               <p>And you, perhaps, my friends, have willingly passed by (as if it were some sacred
                  fish) the fish mentioned by Ephippus the comic poet, which he says was dressed for
                  Geryon, in his play called Geryon. The lines are these:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Of Crete, he furnishes a dish</l>

                     <l>Cranai, and Mygdoniotæ,</l>
                     <l>To cut down wood, because the king</l>
                     <l>Is boiling this enormous fish.</l>
                     <l>So then they bring a load of wood,</l>

                     <l>And light the fire. Then they bring</l>
                     <l>A lake of water to make brine,</l>
                     <l>And for eight months a hundred carts</l>
                     <l>Are hard at work to carry salt.</l>
                     <l>And around the dish's edge</l>
                     <l>Five five-oar'd boats keep always rowing;</l>

                  </quote> But I am not ignorant that Ephippus has said the very same thing in his
                  play called the Peltast; in which the following lines also are subjoined to those
                  which I have just quoted:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Talking all this nonsense, he</l>
                     <l>Raises the wonder of the youths</l>
                     <l>With whom he feasts, though knowing not</l>
                     <l>The simplest sums and plainest figures;</l>
                     <l>But drags his cloak along the ground</l>
                     <l>With a most lordly, pompous air.</l>
                  </quote> But, with reference to whom it is that Ephippus said this, it is now
                  proper for you to inquire, my good friend Ulpian, and then to tell us; and in this
                  inquiry— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>If you find aught hard and inexplicable,</l>

                     <l>For I have much more leisure than I like;</l>

            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="39">
               <p>And on this Cynulcus exclaimed:—And what great subject of inquiry,—I do not say
                  great fish,—can this fellow admit into his mind?-a man who is always picking out
                  the spines of hepseti and atherintæ, and even of worse fish than these, if there
                  be any such, passing over all finer fish.</p>
               <p>For, as Eubulus says, in the Ixion,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>As if a man at a luxurious feast,</l>

                     <l>But anise, parsley, and such silly fare,</l>
                     <l>And ill-dress'd cardamums . . . .</l>
                  </quote> so, too, this Pot-friend, Ulpian,—to use a would of my
                  fellow-Megalopolitan, Cercidas,—appears to me to eat nothing that a man ought to
                  eat, but to watch those who are eating, to see if they have passed over any spine
                  or any callous or gristly morsel of the meat set before them; never once
                  considering what the admirable and brilliant Aeschylus has said, who called his
                  tragedies, <quote>Relics of the noble banquets of Homer.</quote> But Aeschylus was
                  one of the greatest of philosophers,—a man who, being once defeated undeservedly,
                  as <pb n="v.2.p.548"/> Theophrastus or Chamæleon (whichever was really the author
                  of the book), in his treatise on Pleasure, has related, said that he committed his
                  tragedies to time, well knowing that he should hereafter receive the honour due to
                  him.</p>

               <p>But whence could Ulpian know what Stratonicus the harp-player said about Propis
                  the Rhodian harp-player? For Clearchus, in his book on Proverbs, says that
                  Stratonicus, when he had seen Propis, who was a man of great size, but a very
                  inferior artist, with a mind much less than his body, said to some one who asked
                  him what sort of player he was, <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> speaking enigmatically, and saying, first of all, that he is <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς,</foreign> no one, or good for nothing; secondly, that he
                  is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸς,</foreign> bad; and, in addition to this, that he
                  is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγας,</foreign> great; and, lastly, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰχθὺς,</foreign> a fish, as having no voice. But Theophrastus, in
                  his book on The Laughable, says that this was a proverb originating with
                  Stratonicus, but applied to Simmychas the actor; for that he uttered the proverb,
                  dividing the words distinctly— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγας οὐδεὶς σαπρὸς ἰχθῦς.</foreign>
                     </l>
                  </quote> And Aristotle, in his Constitution of the Naxians, speaks thus of this
                     proverb—<quote>Of the rich men among the Naxians, the greater part lived in the
                     city, but the remainder lived scattered about in the villages. Accordingly, in
                     one of these villages, the name of which was Lestadæ, Telestagoras lived, a man
                     of great riches and of very high reputation, and greatly honoured by the people
                     in other respects, and also with daily presents which they used to send him.
                     And whenever people from the city, going down to the market, wanted to drive a
                     hard bargain for anything they wished to purchase, the sellers would say that
                     they would rather give it to Telestagoras than sell it for such a price as was
                     offered. So some young men, buying a large fish, when the fisherman made this
                     speech, being annoyed at hearing this so often, having already drunk a good
                     deal, went to his house to sup; and Telestagoras received them in a very
                     friendly and hospitable manner, but the young men insulted him, and his two
                     marriageable daughters. At which the Naxians were very indignant, and took up
                     arms and attacked the young men; and there was a great sedition, Lygdamis being
                     the leader of the Naxians, who, having got the chief command in this sedition,
                     became the tyrant of his country.</quote>

                  mentioned the harp-player Stratonicus, to say some- thing also concerning his
                  readiness in repartee. For when he was teaching people to play the harp, and as he
                  had in his school nine statues of the nine Muses, and one of Apollo, and had also
                  two pupils, when some one asked him how many pupils he had, he said, <quote>Gods

                     <l>A last libation to the glorious sun,</l>
                     <l>And then composed himself to sleep, and left</l>
                     <l>The rest to fortune. Presently more guests</l>
                     <l>Came, as good luck would have it, to the singer,</l>

                     <l>Stratonicus, who by chance was present, said,</l>
                     <l>"He cannot make himself a harp-player,</l>

                  Byzantium, when a harp-player had played his prelude well, but had made a blunder
                  of the rest of the performance, he got up and made proclamation, <quote>That
                     whoever would point out the harp-player who had played the prelude should

               <p>Stratonicus said once to the father of Chrysogonus, when he was saying that he had
                  everything at home in great abundance, for that he himself had undertaken the

                  </note> and another play the flute; <quote>You still,</quote> said Stratonicus,
                     <quote>want one thing.</quote> And when the other asked him what that was,
                     <quote>You want,</quote> said he, <quote>a theatre in your house.</quote> And
                  when some one asked him why he kept travelling over the whole of Greece, and did
                  not remain in one city, he said—<quote>That he had received from the Muses all the
                     Greeks as his wages, from whom he was to levy a tax to atone for their
                     ignorance.</quote> And he said that Phaon did not play harmony,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">There is an allusion here to Harmonia the
                     wife of Cadmus.</note> but Cadmus. And when Phaon pretended to great skill on
                  the flute, and said that he had a chorus at Megara, <quote>You are joking,</quote>
                  said he; <quote>for you do not possess anything there, but you are possessed
                     yourself.</quote> And he said—<quote>That he marvelled above all things at the
                     mother of Satyrus the Sophist, because she had borne for nine months a man whom
                     no city in all Greece could bear for nine days.</quote> And once, hearing that
                  he had arrived in Ilium at the time of the Ilian games, <quote>There are,</quote>
                  said he, <quote>always troubles in Ilium.</quote> And when Minnacus was disputing
                  with him about music, he said—<quote>That he was not attending to what he said,
                     because he had got in above his ankles.</quote> At another time he said of a
                  bad physician—<quote>That he made those who were attended by him go to the shades
                     below the very day they came to him.</quote> And having met one of his
                  acquaintances, when he saw his sandals carefully sponged, he pitied him as being
                  badly off, pretending to think that he would never have had his sandals so well
                  sponged if he had not sponged them himself. And as it was a very mixed <pb n="v.2.p.553"/> race of people who lived at Teichius, a town in the Milesian
                  territory, when he saw that all the tombs about were those of foreigners,

                     it seems, die here, and none of the citizens.</quote> And when Zethus the
                  harper was giving a lecture upon music, he said that he was the only person who
                  was utterly unfit to discuss the subject of music, inasmuch as he had chosen the
                  most unmusical of all names, and called himself; Zethus<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Zethus was the name of the brother of Amphion.</note> instead of

                     said,—<quote>That he could tell in what part of the city he was, if men led him

               <p>But I marvel at Aristotle, whom these wise men, my excellent Democritus, are so
                  incessantly speaking of and praising, (and whose writings you also esteem highly,
                  as you do those of the other philosophers and orators,) on account of his great
                  accuracy: and I should like to know when he learnt, or from what Proteus or Nereus
                  who came up from the depths he found out, what fish do, or how they go to sleep,
                  or how they live: for all these things he has told us in his writings, so as to
                  be, in the words of the comic poets, <quote>a wonder to fools;</quote> for he says
                  that the ceryx, and indeed that the whole race of shell-fish, are propagated
                  without copulation; and that the purple-fish and the ceryx are longlived. For how
                  could he know that the purple-fish lives six years? and how could he know that the
                  viper takes a long time to propagate his species? or that of all its tribe the
                  longest at that work is the pigeon, the next the œnas, and the quickest is the
                  turtle-dove? And whence did he learn that the horse lives five-and-thirty years,
                  but the mare more than forty? saying, too, that some have lived even seventy-five
                  years. And he also states that from the copulation of lice there are <pb n="v.2.p.556"/> born nits; and that from a worm, after its change, there is
                  produced a caterpillar, from which comes the humble-bee, and from that the larva
                  of the silk-worm. And he also says that bees live to six years of age, and that
                  some live even seven years; and he says that neither bee nor wasp have ever been
                  seen in the act of copulation, on which account no one can ever tell whether they
                  are male or female. And from what did he learn that men are inferior to bees? for
                  these latter always preserve an equal condition of life, being subject to no
                  changes, but employing themselves without ceasing in the collection of honey, and
                  doing that without having been taught by any one to do so: but men are inferior to
                  bees, and as full of fancy as bees are of honey: how, then has Aristotle observed
                  all these things? And in his treatise on Long Life, he says that a fly has been
                  seen which had lived six or seven years. But what proof is there of this?</p>

                  some are blue, and some are black, and some are hazel. He says, too, that the eyes
                  of men are of different characters, and that the differences of disposition may be
                  judged of from the eyes; for that those men who have goats' eyes, are exceedingly
                  sharp-sighted, and have the best dispositions. And of others, he says that some
                  men have projecting eyes, and some have eyes deeply set, and some keep a mean
                  between the two: and those whose eyes are deeply set, he says, have the sharpest
                  sight, and those whose eyes project, must have the worst dispositions; and those
                  who are moderate in these respects, are people, says he, of moderate dispositions.
                  There are also some people whose eyes are always winking, and some who never wink
                  at all, and some who do so in a moderate degree: and those who are always winking

               <p>He says also that man is the only animal which has its heart on the left side; and
                  that all other animals have it in the middle of the body. And he says that males
                  have more teeth than females; and he affirms that this has been noticed in the
                  case of the sheep, and of the pig, and of the goat. And he says also that there is
                  no fish which has testicles, and there is no fish which has a breast, and no bird
                  ether; but that the only fish which has no gall is the dolphin. There are,
                  however, some, says he, which have no gall in their liver, but they have it near
                  their bowels; as the sturgeon, the synagris, the lamprey, the sword-fish, and the
                  sea-swallow. But the amia has its gall spread over the whole of its entrails: and
                  the hawk and the kite have theirs spread both over their liver and their entrails;
                  but the ægocephalus has his gall both in his liver and in his stomach: and the
                  pigeon, and the quail, and the swallow have theirs, some in their entrails, and
                  some in their stomach.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="49">
               <p>Moreover, he says that all the molluscous fish, and the shell-fish, and the
                  cartilaginous fish, and all insects, spend a long time in copulation; but that the
                  dolphin and some other fish copulate lying alongside the female. And he says that
                  the dolphins are very slow, but fish in general very quick. Again he says that the
                  lion has very solid bones, and that if they are struck, fire comes from them as
                  from flint stones. And that the dolphin has bones, but no spine; but that
                  cartilaginous fish have both gristle and spine. And of animals he says that some
                  are terrestrial and some aquatic; land that some even live in the fire; and that
                  there are some, which he calls ephemera, which live only one day: and that there
                  are some which are amphibious, such as the river-horse, and the crocodile, and the
                  otter. And that all animals in general have two forefeet, but that the crab has
                  four; and that all the animals which have blood are either without feet t all, or
                  are bipeds, or quadrupeds; and that all the animals which have more than four feet
                  are destitute of blood: n which account every animal which moves, moves by what he
                  calls four tokens,—man by two hands and two feet, a bird by two feet and two
                  wings, an eel and a conger by two fins and two joints. Moreover, some animals have
                  hands, as a man has, and some appear to have hands, as a monkey does; or there is
                  no brute beast which can really give and take, and it is for <pb n="v.2.p.558"/>
                  those things that hands are given to men as instruments. Again, some animals have
                  limbs, as a man, an ox, an ass; and some have no limbs, as a serpent, an oyster,
                  the pulmo marinus. There are also many animals which are not always visible, such
                  as those which hide in holes; and those which do not hide in holes are still not
                  always visible, as swallows and cranes.</p>

               <p>And though I could repeat to you now a great deal of nonsense which the
                  medicine-seller talked, I forbear to do so, although I know that Epicurus, that
                  most truthful of men, said of him in his letter about Institutions, that he
                  devoted himself to a military life after having squandered his patrimony in
                  gluttony; and that, turning out an indifferent soldier, he then took to selling
                  medicines. Then, when the school of Plato was opened, he says, he changed again,
                  and applied himself to philosophical discussions, and as he was not a man
                  destitute of ability, by little and little he became a speculative philosopher. I
                  know, too, that Epicurus is the only person who ever said this of him; for neither
                  did Eubulides nor Cephisodorus venture to say anything of the kind against the
                  Stagirite, and that, too, though they did write books against him. But in that
                  same letter Epicurus says, that Protagoras also, who became a philosopher from
                  having been a porter and a wood-carrier, was first promoted to be an amanuensis of
                  Democritus; who, wondering at the admirable way in which he used to put the wood
                  together, took him under his eye in consequence of this beginning; and then he
                  began to teach the rudiments of learning in some village, and after that he
                  proceeded on to the study of philosophy. And I now, O fellow feasters, after all
                  this conversation, feel a great desire for something to eat. And when some one
                  said that the cooks were already preparing something, and taking care that the
                  dishes should not be served up cold, on account of the excessive length to which
                  the <quote>feast of words</quote> had been carried, for that no one could eat cold
                  dishes, Cynulcus said,—But I, like the Milcon of Alexis, the comic poet, can eat
                  them even if they are not served up warm— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Can you deny this? and that what is sweet</l>

                  <pb n="v.2.p.559"/> And it was not without some cleverness that Sphærus, who was
                  a fellow-pupil with Chrysippus in the school of Cleanthes, when he had been sent
                  for to Alexandria by king Ptolemy; when on one occasion birds made of wax were
                  served up at a banquet, and he was putting out his hand to take some, but was
                  stopped by the king, who told him that he was assenting to a sham; very
                  appropriately answered,—'That he did not agree that they were birds at all, but
                  only that it was probable that they might be birds; and that an opinion which
                  could be confirmed by the perception, is superior to that which is merely
                  probable; for that the one cannot be incorrect, but that what is probable may turn
                  out Contrary to what was expected." And so it could not be a bad thing if some
                  waxen dishes were brought round to us too, according to our perceptive opinions,
                  so that we might be beguiled at least by the sight of them, and so escape talking

                  </quote> And indeed, said he, I say that the discussion about fish is still
                  defective in some points, since the sons of Aesculapius (such as Philotimus I
                  mean, in his essay on Food, and Mnesitheus the Athenian, and Diphilus the
                  Siphnian) hare said a good deal about fishes, of which we have as yet taken no
                  notice. For Diphilus, in his work entitled A Treatise on Food fit for People in
                  Health and Invalids, says,—"Of sea-fish, those which keep to the rocks are easily
                  digested, and juicy, and purgative, and light, but not very nutritious; but those
                  which keep in the deep water are much less digestible, very nutritious, but apt to
                  disagree with one. Now, of the fish which keep to the rocks, the phycen and the
                  phycis are very tender little fish, and very digestible; but the perch, which is
                  like them, varies a little as to the places in which it is found. And the tench
                  resembles the perch; but the smaller tench and the white ones are tender, juicy,
                  and digestible; but the green ones (and they are also called caulinæ) are dry, and
                  devoid of juice. The channæ also have tender meat, put still they are harder than
                  the perch. Then there is the scarus, which has tender flesh, not very firm, sweet,
                  light, digestible, <pb n="v.2.p.560"/> not apt to disagree with one, and good for
                  the stomach. But the fresh ones are less popular than the others, because they
                  hunt the sea-hares and feed on them, owing to which their entrails are apt to
                  produce cholera morbus. And the fish which is called ceris is tender, good for the
                  bowels, and good for the stomach; but its juice has fattening and purgative
                  qualities. The orphus, which some write <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφὸς,</foreign> and
                  some <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφὼς,</foreign> is very full of a pleasant juice,
                  glutinous, indigestible, very nutritious, diuretic. But the parts near his head
                  are glutinous and digestible; but the more fleshy parts are indigestible and
                  heavy, and the part towards the tail is the tenderest part; and he is a fish apt
                  to generate phlegm, and indigestible. The sphyrenæ are more nutritious than the
                  congers; and the eel caught in lakes is not so nice as the sea-eel, but it is more
                  nutritious. The chrysophrys is very like the melanurus; and the sea-scorpions,
                  which are found in the deep sea, and are of a tawny colour, are more nutritious
                  than those which are found in marshes, or than the large ones which are taken on
                  the shores.</p>

                  stomach, diuretic, and not indigestible; but when he is fried he is indigestible.
                  The mullet is good for the stomach, very astringent, of very firm flesh, not very
                  digestible, apt to bind the bowels, especially when it is broiled; but when it is
                  fried in a frying-pan, then it is heavy and indigestible; and, as a general rule,
                  the whole tribe of mullets has the property of causing secretions of blood. The
                  synodon and the charax are of the same kind, but the charax is the better of the
                  two. The phagrus is found both in the river and in the sea; but that which is
                  found in the sea is the best. The capriscus is called also the mussel; but it has
                  a strong smell, and very hard meat, and it is more indigestible than the citharus;
                  but its skin is very pleasant to the taste. The needle-fish, or belone, and it is
                  also called the ablennes, is indigestible and moist, but good for the bowels. The
                  thrissa, and those of the same kind, such as the chalcis and the eretimis, are
                  very digestible. The cestreus is found in the sea, and in rivers, and in lakes.
                  And this fish, says he, is also called the oxyrhynchus; but the one which is taken
                  in the Nile is called the coracinus. And the black kind is smaller than the white,
                  and when boiled it is not so good as when it is roasted; for when roasted it is
                  good for <pb n="v.2.p.561"/> the stomach and good for the bowels. The salpe is
                  hard- fleshed, and unpleasant to the taste, but the best are those which are
                  caught at Alexandria, and those which are taken in the autumn. For it is white,
                  full of moisture, and free from any unpleasant smell. The gryllus is like the eel
                  in appearance, but it is not nice to the taste. The sea-hawk is harder than the
                  sea-cuckoo, but in other respects they are much alike. The uranoscopus, and also
                  the fish called agus, which is also called the callionymus, are heavy fish. The
                  boax, when boiled, is very digestible, giving out a very wholesome juice, and is
                  good for the stomach; and that which is broiled on the coals is sweeter and more
                  tender. The bacchus is full of abundant and agreeable and wholesome juice, and is
                  very nutritious. The sea-goat is not very agreeable as to its juice, not very
                  digestible, and has a disagreeable smell. The sea-sparrow and the buglossus are
                  both nutritious and palatable, and the turbot is like them. The sea-grayling, the
                  cephalus, the cestreus, the myxinus, and the colon are all much alike as to their
                  eatable properties; but the cestreus is inferior to the cephalus, the myxinus is
                  worse, and the colon is the least good of all.</p>

               <p>"Of cartilaginous fish, the sea-cow is fleshy, but the shark is superior to

                  sea-fox, is in taste very like the land animal, from which circumstance, indeed,
                  it has its name. The ray is a very delicate fish to the taste; but the stellated
                  ray is tenderer still, and full of excellent juice; but the smooth ray is less
                  wholesome for the stomach, and has an unpleasant smell. But the torpedo, which is
                  hard of digestion, is in the parts below the head very tender, and good for the
                  stomach, and, moreover, very digestible, but its other parts are not so; and the
                  small ones are the best, especially when they are plain boiled. The rhine, which
                  is one of th cartilaginous class, is very digestible and light; but those of the
                  largest size are the most nutritious; and, as a general rule, <pb n="v.2.p.562"/>
                  all the cartilaginous fish are apt to create flatulence, and are fleshy, and
                  difficult of digestion, and if they are eaten in any quantity, they are bad for
                  the eyes. The cuttlefish, when boiled, is tender, palatable, and digestible, and
                  also good for the stomach; but the juice which comes from it has the property of
                  making the blood thin, and is apt to cause secretions by hemorrhoids. The squid is
                  more digestible, and is nutritious, especially the small-sized one; but when
                  boiled they are harder, and not palatable. The polypus promotes amativeness, but
                  it is hard and indigestible; and those of the largest size are the most
                  nutritious, and when they are much boiled, they have a tendency to fill the
                  stomach with liquid, and they bind the bowels. And Alexis, in his Pamphila, points
                  out the useful properties of the polypus, speaking as follows,— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     very indigestible; but when cured like the callubium, it is quite as good for
                     the stomach, and it has a tendency to make the blood thin; and the large kind
                     is called the synodontis. The sea-swallow, or chelidonias, is also something
                     like the pelamys, but harder; and the chelidon is like the polypus, and emits
                     juice which purifies the complexion, and stirs up the blood. The orcynus is a
                     fish who delights in the mud; and the larger kind is like the chelidonias in
                     hardness, but the lower part of its abdomen and its collar-bone are palatable
                     and tender; but those which are called costæ, when cured and salted, are a
                     middling fish. The xanthias has rather a strong smell, and is tenderer than the

                  digestion, but when they are digested they supply a great deal of nourishment. And
                  the whole class of scaly fish, such as the thynni, the scombri, the tunnies, the
                  congers, and all of those kinds, are also gregarious. But those which are not seen
                     <pb n="v.2.p.563"/> by themselves, nor in large shoals, are the most
                  digestible, such as the congers, and the carcharie, and fish of that kind. But the
                  gregarious kinds of fish of that sort are very pleasant to the palate, for they
                  are fat; but they are heavy, ad difficult of digestion, on which account they are
                  very good for curing; and, indeed, these kinds make the best cured fish of all;
                  they are also very good roasted, for by that process their fatty parts are got rid
                  of. But those kinds which are skinned before they are dressed, as a general rule,
                  are those fish which have a rough outside to their skin, not of scales, but such
                  as rays and rhino have. And all these kinds are easily divided into small pieces,
                  but they have not a sweet smell. And they supply the body with plenty of moist
                  nourishment, and of all boiled fish they have the greatest effect on the bowels;
                  but when they are roasted they are not so good. And the whole class of molluscous
                  fish, such as polypi and cuttlefish, and others like them, are very indigestible,
                  on which account they are very serviceable in exciting the amatory passions. They
                  are also calculated to cause flatulence; and the time of indulgence in amatory
                  pleasures requires a flatulent habit of body. All these fish are better when
                  boiled. For their juices are injurious, and you may see what juices they emit when
                  they are washed; and the boiling extracts all these juices from their flesh. For
                  as the heat which is applied in boiling is a gradual one, and conjoined with
                  moisture, there is, as it were, a sort of washing of them. But when they are
                  roasted, that dries up the moisture, and moreover, as their flesh is hard by
                  nature, it is natural that it should be made more so in this way.</p>

               <p>“But anchovies of all kinds, and membrades, and trichides, and all the other
                  little fish which we eat backbones and all, make the digestion flatulent, and give
                  a good deal of moist nutriment. And so, as the digestion is unequal, the flesh
                  being digested with great rapidity, and the bones dissolving slowly, for the
                  anchovies are very bony of themselves, the digestion of the one part hinders the
                  digestion of the other, and so flatulence arises from the digestion, ad moisture
                  comes from the quantity of nourishment. They are better when they are boiled, but
                  still they have very unequal effects on the bowels. The fish which keep close to
                  the rocks, such as tench, and scorpions, and sea-sparrows, and others of the same
                  kind, supply a dry kind of nourishment to our bodies, but <pb n="v.2.p.564"/>
                  they are light and nutritious, and are easily digested, and leave nothing behind
                  them, and are not apt to cause flatulence. And every kind of fish is more
                  digestible when dressed simply, and especially those which keep near the rocks
                  have a better flavour when dressed plainly. And the species which is called
                  soft-fleshed is like them, namely, the sea-thrush, the sea-blackbird, and others
                  which resemble them. And these contain more moisture than the others, and with
                  respect to refreshing the strength of those who eat them, they have more efficacy.
                  And if any one wishes to produce an effect upon his bowels, he should eat them
                  boiled; but if he is in good health, then he will find them nutritious roasted.
                  And as diuretic food they are equally useful cooked either way.</p>

                  <quote>But the places of the sea where rivers and lakes fall into it, and also
                     those where there are large bays and gulfs of the sea, are those where all the
                     fish are more juicy, and more full of fat. They are also more palatable when
                     caught in those places, but less nutritious and less digestible. And on the
                     shore where it is exposed to the open sea, and where it is unprotected, then
                     the fishes found there are for the most part hard and thin, beaten by the
                     continued action of the waves. But where the sea is deep close in shore and
                     less exposed to violent winds, especially if there are any cities near, then
                     there is the greatest number of fish, and they are equally excellent in respect
                     of pleasantness of flavour and ease of digestion, and also in the nourishment
                     which they afford to the body. But of sea fish those are the most indigestible
                     and the heaviest which migrate at certain seasons from the sea to the lakes and
                     rivers; such as the cestreus; and as a general rule that is the character of
                     every fish which can live in both salt and fresh water. But of those which live
                     wholly in rivers and lakes, the river fish are the best; for the water of lakes
                     is more apt to putrefy. And, again, of river fish those are the best which are
                     found in the most rapid rivers; and especially the trout; for those are never
                     found except where the river is rapid and cold, and they are far superior to
                     all other river fish in their digestible properties.</quote>

               <p>But, since we have mentioned the Rhodian histories, I myself am now going to tell
                  you something about fish, from the account given of the beautiful Rhodes, which
                  that delightful writer Lynceus says is full of excellent fish. Ergias the Rhodian,
                  then, in his Account of his own Country, having first made mention of the
                  Phoenicians, who inhabited the island, says—"That Phalanthus, and his friends,
                  having a very strong city in Ialysus, called Achaia, and being very economical of
                  their provisions, held out for a long time against Iphiclus, who besieged them.
                  For they had also a prophecy given them by some oracle, that they should keep the
                  place till crows became white, and till fish were seen in their goblets. They
                  therefore, expecting that these things would never happen, prosecuted the war with
                  less vigour. But Iphiclus, having heard from some one of the oracles of the
                  Phœnicians, and having waylaid a highly-trusted adherent of Phalanthus, whose name
                  was Larcas, as he was going for water, and having entered into a covenant with
                  him, caught some fish at the spring, and putting them into the ewer, gave them to
                  Larcas, and bade him carry the water back, and pour it into the goblet from which
                  he was used to pour out wine for Phalanthus: and he did so. And Iphiclus also
                  caught some crows, and smeared them over with gypsum, and let them fly again. But
                  when Phalanthus saw the crows, he went to his goblet; and when he saw the fish
                  there, he considered that the place no longer belonged to him and his party, and
                  so he sent a herald to Iphiclus, demanding permission to retire, with all his
                  troops, under the protection of a treaty, And when Iphiclus agreed to this,
                  Phalanthus devised the follow- <pb n="v.2.p.569"/> ing contrivance. Having slain
                  some victims, and taken out the entrails, he endeavoured to put in some silver and
                  gold, and so to carry it away. But when Iphiclus percieved this, he prevented it.
                  And when Phalanthus alleged against him the oath which he had taken, when he swore
                  to allow them to take away whatever they had in their bellies, he met them with a
                  counter device, giving them vessels to go away in, but taking away the rudders,
                  and the oars, and the sails, saying that he had sworn to give them boats, and
                  nothing further. And as the Phœnicians were in great perplexity, they buried a
                  great deal of their riches underground, marking the places where they buried it,
                  that at some future time they might come and take it up again; but they left a
                  great deal for Iphiclus. And so, when the Phœnicians had left the place in this
                  manner, the Greeks became masters of it.” And Polyzelus has given the same
                  account, in his History of Rhodian Affairs; and says—<quote>That the only people
                     who knew the secret about the fishes and the crows were Phaces and his daughter
                     Dorcia; and she, being beloved by Iphiclus, and having come to an agreement to
                     marry him through the intervention of her nurse, persuaded the man who brought
                     the water to bring the fish and put them into the goblet; and she herself
                     whitewashed the crows, and let them go.</quote>

               <p>And Creophylus, in his Annals of the Ephesians, says— <quote>Those who colonized
                     Ephesus, being much perplexed for want of a place where they could settle, sent
                     at last to the oracle, and asked where they should build themselves a city; and
                     he told them to build a city in that place which a fish should show them, and
                     to which a wild boar should guide them. Accordingly, it is said that some
                     fishermen were breakfasting at the spot where the fountain called Hypeleus now
                     is, and where the harbour is which is called the sacred harbour; and that one
                     of the fish leaped up with a burning cinder sticking to him, and fell on some
                     of the refuse; and that by this means a thicket was set on fire, in which there
                     happened to be a wild boar; and he, being disturbed by the fire ran for some
                     distance up the mountain which is called th Rough Mountain, and at last was
                     transfixed by javelins, and fell where the temple of Minerva now stands. And
                     the Ephesians, having crossed over from the island, occupied that for
                     twenty-one years, and in the twenty-second year they founded Trachea and the
                     towns around Coressus, and erected a temple <pb n="v.2.p.570"/> to Diana in
                     the market-place, and one to the Pythian Apollo overlooking the

               <p>Now after this long conversation, all of a sudden there was heard all over the
                  city the music of flutes and the noise of cymbals, and also a great crash of
                  drums, with singing at the same time. And it happened to be the time of a festival
                  which used formerly to be called the Parilia, but which is now called the Romana,
                  in honour of the temple built to the Fortune of the City, by that most excellent

                  feasts they called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρανοι,</foreign> the materials for which
                  were contributed by all who joined in them; and this name was derived from all the
                  guests being friendly together (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ συνερᾷν</foreign>)
                  and contributing. And this same <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρανος</foreign> is also
                  called <foreign xml:lang="grc">θίασος,</foreign> and those who partake of it are
                  called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρανισταὶ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνθιαῶται.</foreign> The crowd, also, which follows Bacchus in his festivals
                  is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">θίασος,</foreign> as Euripides says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I see three thiasi of women coming.</l>

                  of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιός.</foreign> And the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰλαπίνη</foreign> is
                  derived from the preparation and expense gone to for such purposes; for being
                  destructive and extravagant is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαφύττειν καὶ
                     λαπάζειν,</foreign> from which words the poets have used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλαπάζω</foreign> for to destroy, And the plunder which is carried
                  off after the sacking of a city they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάφυρα.</foreign>
                  And accordingly Aeschylus and Eripides have given to the more luxurious banquets
                  the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰλάπιναι,</foreign> from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαπάζω.</foreign> There is also a verb, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάπτω,</foreign>
                  <pb n="v.2.p.572"/> which means to digest one's food, and to become relaxed
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγαρὸς</foreign>) by becoming empty. And from this word
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγαρὸς</foreign> we get the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγὼν</foreign> (the flank), and also <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάγανον</foreign>
                  (a thin, broad cake); and from the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαπάττω</foreign> we
                  get <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαπάρα</foreign> (the loins). And the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαφύττω</foreign> means, with great freedom and abundance to
                  evacuate and erupt oneself. And the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαπανάω</foreign>
                  (to spend) is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάπτω;</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάπτω</foreign> is akin to <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαψιλής;</foreign> on which account we find the verbs <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάπτω</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαρδάπτω</foreign> applied to those
                  who eat in a voracious and savage manner. Homer says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  is derived not from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀχὴ,</foreign> which means nutriment,
                  but from everything going on well (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ εὖ
                     ἔχειν</foreign>) in such a banquet, in which those who assemble honour the
                  deity, and give themselves up to mirth and relaxation; and from this relaxation
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ μεθιέναι</foreign>) they call wine <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέθυ,</foreign> and the god who gave them wine they call
                  Methymnaeus, and Lyæus, and Evius, and Icius; just as also they call a man who is
                  not sullen-looking and morose <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱλαρός;</foreign> on which
                  account, too, they pray the deity to be propitious (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵλεως</foreign>), uttering the ejaculation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰὴ,

                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερόν.</foreign> And that they meant very nearly the same
                  thing by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵλεως</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱλαρός</foreign> is plain from the language used by Ephippus, in his play

               <p>But the ancients, who represented the gods under the form of men, arranged all
                  their festivals on a similar principle; for, seeing that it is not possible to
                  divert men from an eagerness for pleasure, but that it is useful and expedient to
                  accustom them to enjoy themselves with moderation and in an orderly manner, they
                  set apart certain times, and, sacrificing first to the gods, they in this way
                  permitted them relaxation and enjoyment, in order that every one, thinking that
                  the gods had come among them, and were present at the <pb n="v.2.p.573"/>
                  firstfruits and libations, might enjoy himself with order and decency. Accordingly
                  Homer says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There, too, was Pallas to partake the feast:</l>
                  </quote> and Neptune, too, is represented thus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The monarch of the main, a heavenly guest,</l>
                     <l>In Ethiopia graced the genial feast,</l>
                     <l>There on the world's extremest verge, revered</l>
                     <l>With hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferr'd,</l>
                     <l>Distant he lay:<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hom. Odyss. i.
                           22.</note>—</l>
                  </quote> and of Jupiter he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The sire of gods and all the ethereal train</l>
                     <l>On the warm limits of the furthest main</l>
                     <l>Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace</l>
                     <l>The feast of Ethiopia's blameless race.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hom. Iliad, i. 424.</note>
                     </l>
                  </quote> And if a man of more mature age, and devoted to wise and virtuous
                  pursuits, is present, they are ashamed to say or do anything indecorous; as also
                  Epicharmus says, somewhere or other:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But when their aged superiors are present,</l>
                     <l>Young men should silent be.</l>
                  </quote> Therefore, considering that the gods were near to them, they celebrated
                  their festivals in an orderly and temperate man- ner; on which account it was not
                  the fashion of the ancients to lie at their meals, but, as Homer says,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Feasting they sate;</l>
                  </quote> nor were they accustomed to drink to the extent of drunkenness— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But when they'd eaten thus, and drank their fill,</l>
                     <l>Each to his room retired, not dreaming ill.</l>

               <p>But the men of modern times, pretending to be sacrificing to the gods, and

                  their children, and abuse their wives, and treat their slaves with indignity, and
                  threaten the multitude, almost verifying the line of Homer:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  wrote the poem entitled Chiron, whether it is Pherecrates, or Nicomachus, the

                  </quote> The ancients, also, were acquainted with the banquets which are now
                  called dole-basket banquets; and Pherecrates mentions them in his Forgetful Man,

                     <l>Having prepared a small dole-basket supper</l>
                     <l>He went away to Ophela.</l>
                  </quote> And this clearly points to the dole-basket supper, when a man prepares a
                  supper for himself, and then puts it in a basket, and goes off to sup with some
                  one. And Lysias has used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνδειπνον</foreign> for a
                  banquet, in his speech against Micinus, on his trial for murder; for he says that

                     says—<quote>Those who had made a <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνδειπνον</foreign>:</quote> and Aristophanes, in his Gerytades, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>They also celebrate a picnic feast.</l>
                  </quote> They also use the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνάγω</foreign> for to
                  drink with on another, and the noun <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναγώγιον</foreign> for
                  a drinking party. Menander, in his Angry Woman, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And for this reason now they drink (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συνάγουσι</foreign>) alone:</l>

                  </quote> And probably the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναγώγιον</foreign> is the same
                  as that which was also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀπὸ συμβολων

                  For I see that that condiment is being brought round in the dishes with the hams.
                  And I see that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωλεὸς,</foreign>
                  <hi rend="italics">a ham,</hi> is now used in the masculine gender, and not in the
                  feminine only, as our Attic writers use it. At all events, Epicharmus, in his

               <p>And as immediately after this a great quantity of food of all sorts was brought

                  for there <pb n="v.2.p.581"/> was a great quantity of birds, and of geese, and
                  also of young birds (which some people call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίποι</foreign>), and of pigs, and of those highly-esteemed birds the pheasants.

            <div type="chapter" n="8">
               <p>First of all, there were turnips; and Apellas in his treatise on the Cities in
                  Peloponnesus, says that turnips are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαστέρες</foreign> by the Lacedæmonians: and Nicander the Colophonian, in his
                  Dialects, says that among the Bœotians it is cabbages which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαστέρες,</foreign> and that turnips are called in Bœotia <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζεκελτίδες.</foreign> But Amerias and Timachidas affirm that it is
                  gourds which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζακελτίδες.</foreign> And
                  Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things resembling one another,
                     says—<quote>The radish, the turnip, the rape, and the nasturtium all resemble
                     each other.</quote> But Glaucus, in his Cookery Book, spells the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάφυς</foreign> (rape) with the lene <foreign xml:lang="grc">π,</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάπυς.</foreign> But these vegetables have
                  nothing else like them, unless, indeed, it be the plant which we call bounias: but
                  Theophrastus does not use the name of bounias, but calls it a sort of male turnip;
                  and perhaps the plant which he means is the bounias. And Nicander, in his
                  Georgics, mentions the bounias— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Sow turnips on a well-roll'd field, that they</l>
                     <l>May grow as large as the flat dish that holds them,</l>
                     <l>* * * *</l>
                     <l>. . . . . For there are two kinds</l>
                     <l>Which from the radish spring: one long, one firm,</l>
                     <l>Both seen in well-till'd beds in kitchen gardens.</l>
                  </quote> And the turnips which grow on the banks of the Cephisus are mentioned by
                  Cratis, in his Orators, thus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And wholly like the turnips of Cephisus.</l>
                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>But Theophrastus says that there are two kinds of turnips, the male and the
                  female, and that they both come from the same seed; but Posidonius the Stoic
                  philosopher, in the twenty-seventh book of his Histories, concerning Dalmatia,
                  says that there are some turnips which grow without any cultivation, and also some
                  carrots that grow wild. But Diphilus the physician, of Siphnos, says—<quote>The
                     turnip has attenuating properties, and is harsh and indigestible, and moreover
                     is apt to cause flatulence: but the vegetable called bounias is superior to
                     that; for it is sweeter in taste and <pb n="v.2.p.582"/> more digestible, in
                     addition to being wholesome for the sto- mach and nutritious. But the
                     turnip,</quote> he says, <quote>when roasted, is more easily digested, but in
                     this state it attenuates the blood still more.</quote> This vegetable is
                  mentioned by Eubulus, in his Ancylion, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I bring this turnip to be roasted now.</l>
                  </quote> And Alexis, in his Enthusiast, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I speak to Ptolemy, roasting slices of turnip.</l>
                  </quote> But the turnip, when pickled, is more attenuating in its effects than
                  when boiled, especially when it is pickled with mustard, as Diphilus says.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="9">
               <p>Then there was the cabbage. Eudemus the Athenian, in his treatise on Vegetables,
                  says that there are three kinds of cabbage—the kind called the salt-cabbage, and
                  the smooth-leaved-cabbage, and the parsley-cabbage: and that the salt-cabbage is
                  reckoned the finest of all in respect of its delicacy of taste; and it grows in
                  Eretria, and Cyme, and Rhodes, and also in Cnidos and Ephesus: but the
                  smooth-leaved kind is found in every country; and the parsley-cabbage has its name
                  from the curly nature of its leaves, for it is like parsley, both in that respect
                  and in its general thickness. But Theophrastus writes thus—<quote>But of the,
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάφανος,—</foreign>I mean the cabbage,—there is one
                     kind with curly leaves, and another with smooth leaves, and a third which is
                     wild.</quote> And Diphilus the Siphnian says—<quote>The finest and most
                     delicious cabbage grows in Cyme; in Alexandria it is bitter; and the seed which
                     is brought from Rhodes to Alexandria produces sweet cabbage for one year, after
                     which time it degenerates again, from the nature of the soil.</quote> And
                  Nicander, in his Georgics, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The smooth-leaved cabbage sometimes wild is found,</l>
                     <l>And then the curly many-leaved plants</l>
                     <l>Are often sown in beds; . . . . . . .</l>
                     <l>There is another kind, of reddish colour,</l>
                     <l>Like frogs in drought; some of bad colour too</l>
                     <l>Do come from Cyme, like the dingy soles</l>
                     <l>Which cobblers often sew on worn-out boots;</l>
                     <l>And these the ancients do the Prophets call</l>
                  </quote> But perhaps Nicander calls the cabbage Prophet, as being sacred; since in
                  Hipponax, in his Iambics, we find some such lines as these,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He falling down worshipp'd the seven-leaved cabbage,</l>
                     <l>To which, before she drank the poison'd draught,</l>
                     <l>Pandora brought a cake at the Thargelia.</l>
                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.2.p.583"/> And Ananius says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And, by the cabbage do I swear, I love thee</l>
                     <l>By far the most of mortal men . . . </l>
                  </quote> And Teleclides, in his Prytanes, uses the oath, <quote>Yes, by the
                     cabbages</quote> and Epicharmus has the same exclamation in his Earth and Sea;
                  and so has Eupolis, in his Dyer; and it appears to have been an Ionian oath: and
                  there is nothing very strange in the fact of some people having sworn by the
                  cabbage, since Zeno the Cittiæan, the founder of the sect of the Stoics, imitating
                  the oath of Socrates, <quote>by the bitch,</quote> was used himself to swear
                     <quote>by the caper,</quote> as Empodus relates in his Memorabilia.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="10">
               <p>And at Athens the cabbage used to be given to women who had just been delivered,
                  as a sort of medicine, having a tendency to add to their nourishment. Accordingly,
                  Ephippus, in his Geryones, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And then to boil a radish bright with oil,</l>
                     <l>And fry the breasts of well-fed household Iamb,</l>
                     <l>And to pluck pigeons, thrushes too, and finches,</l>

                     <l>And to quaff many goblets of pure wine.</l>
                  </quote> And Antiphanes, in his Parasite, speaks of the cabbage as an economical
                  food, in the following lines, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And what these things are, you, my wife, know well;</l>
                     <l>Garlic, and cheese, and cheese-cakes, dainty dishes</l>

                     <l>And in the dish with it some pulse of pease.</l>

               <p>The next thing to be mentioned is beet-root. Of beetroot (according to the opinion
                  of Theophrastus), the white is more juicy than the black, and it contains less
                  seed, and it is the kind which is called the Sicilian beet. But, says he, the beet
                  called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σευτλὶς</foreign> is a different kind from the
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεῦτλον.</foreign> On which account, Diphilus the comic
                  poet, in his drama called the Hero, reproaches some one for speaking incorrectly,
                  and for calling <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεῦτλα, τευτλίδας.</foreign> And Eudemus, in
                  his treatise on Vegetables, says that there are four kinds of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεὖτλα</foreign>: there is the kind which may be pulled, the kind
                  with a stalk, the white kind, and the common kind; and this last is of a brown
                  colour. But Diphilus the Siphnian says that the beet which he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεύτλιον</foreign> is more juicy than the cabbage, and is also, in
                  a moderate degree, more nutritious; and it ought to be boiled and eaten with
                  mustard, and that then it has a tendency to attenuate the blood, and to destroy
                  worms; but the white kind is better for the stomach, while the black is more
                  diuretic. He says, also, that their roots are more pleasing to the palate, and
                  more nutritious.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="12">
               <p>Then there is the carrot. <quote>This vegetable,</quote> says Diphilus, <quote>is
                     harsh, but tolerably nutritious, and moderately good for the stomach; but it
                     passes quickly through the bowels, and causes flatulence: it is indigestible,
                     diuretic, and not without some influence in prompting men to amatory feelings;
                     on which account it is called a philtre by some people.</quote> And Numenius,
                  in his Man fond of Fishing, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  <pb n="v.2.p.585"/> Theophrastus also mentions the carrot; and Phænias, in the

                     nature of the seed, the plant which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὴψ</foreign> and the seed of the carrot are much alike.</quote> And in his
                  first book he says—<quote>The following plants have seed in pods of umbellated
                     form: the anise, fennel, the carrot, the bur-parsley, hemlock, coriander, and
                     aconite (which some call mousekiller).</quote> But, since Nicander has
                  mentioned the arum, I must also add that Phænias, in the book which I have just
                  mentioned, writes thus:—<quote>The dracontium, which some call arum or
                     aronia.</quote> But Diocles, in the first book of his treatise on the
                  Wholesomes, calls the carrot, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">σταφυλῖνος,</foreign> but
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσταφύλινος.</foreign> There is also another kind which
                  is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρωτὸν,</foreign> which is a large and well-grown
                  carrot, more juicy than the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σταφυλῖνος,</foreign> and more
                  heating,—more diuretic, very good for the stomach, and very easily digested, as
                  Diphilus assures us.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="13">
               <p>Then there is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφαλωτὸν,</foreign> or leek, which the

                  says that it is superior to the kind called the sliced-leek, and that it has some
                  effect in attenuating the blood, and is nutritious, and apt to cause flatulence.
                  But Epænetus, in his Cookery Book, says that the leeks are also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γηθυλλίδες;</foreign> and I find this name occurring in Eubulus,

                  which Phrynichus mentions in his Saturn. And Didymus, interpreting that play, says
                  that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γήθυον</foreign> resembles the leek called the

                  </quote> And Polemo the geographer, in his book on Samothrace, says that Latona
                  had a longing for the gethyllis, writing as follows:—"Among the Delphians, at the
                  festival which <pb n="v.2.p.586"/> they call the Theoxenia, there is a rule that
                  whoever brings the largest gethyllis to Latona shall receive a portion of food
                  from off her table; and I myself have seen a gethyllis as big as a turnip or as
                  the round rape. And men say that Latona, when she was pregnant with Apollo, longed
                  for the gethyllis; on which account it is treated with this respect."</p>

                  January; for they were green, and full of their own Peculiar flavour, and they
                  happened to have been dressed by <pb n="v.2.p.587"/> cooks who above all men knew
                  how to dress and season such things. Laurentius, therefore, asked whether the
                  ancients were acquainted with this vegetable, or with this way of dressing it. And
                  Ulpian said—Nicander the Colophonian, in the second book of his Georgics, mentions
                  this way of dressing the vegetable, calling the gourds not <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολόκυνται,</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίκυαι;</foreign> for, indeed,
                  that was one of their names, as we have said before. And his words are:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>First cut the gourds in slices, and then run</l>

                  the exclusion of others, as is now done when we speak of buying birds, and mean
                  only poultry. Accordingly, Homer says, <quote rend="blockquote">

                  forward, my friends, for you judgment, what Chamæleon of Heraclea has said about
                  him in the sixth book of his treatise on Comedy; where he uses the following
                  language:—"Anaxandrides once, publishing a dithyrambic poem at Athens, entered the
                  city on a horse, and recited some lines of his Ode. And he was a very fine,
                  handsome man to look at; and he let his hair grow, and wore a purple robe with
                  golden fringes, but being a man of a bitter disposition he was in the habit of
                  behaving in some such manner as this with respect to his comedies. Whenever he did
                  not get the victory he took his play and sent it to the frankincense market to be
                  torn up to pack bunches of frankincense in, and did not revise it as most people
                  did. And in this way he destroyed many clever and elegant plays; being, by reason
                  of his old age, very sulky with the spectators. And he is said to have been a
                  Rhodian by birth, of the city of Camirus: and I wonder therefore how it was that
                  his Tereus got preserved, since it did not obtain the victory; and I feel the same
                  wonder in the case of others by the same author. And Theopompus, in his Peace,
                  also uses the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλεκτρύων</foreign> for hens, speaking
                  thus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I am so vex'd at having lost the hen (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλεκτρυόνα</foreign>)</l>

                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.2.p.590"/> And in another place he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And frighten'd, lay wind eggs.</l>
                  </quote> And in the Clouds, where he is explaining to the old man the difference
                  between the names, he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But concerning the pig, that it is accounted a sacred animal among the Cretans,
                  Agathocles the Babylonian, in the first book of his account of Cyzicus, speaks as
                  follows— "They say that Jupiter was born in Crete, on the mountain Dicte; on which
                  mountain a mysterious sacrifice used to take place. For it is said that a sow
                  allowed Jupiter to suck its udder. And that she going about with her constant
                  grunting, made the whining of the infant inaudible to those who were looking for
                  him. On which account all the Cretans think that that animal is to be worshipped;
                  and nothing, it is said, can induce them to eat its flesh. And the Praisians also
                  sacrifice to a sow; and this is a regular sacrifice among that people before
                  marriage. And Neanthes of Cyzicus gives a similar account, in the second book of
                  his treatise on Mysteries.</p>
               <p>Achæus the Eretrian mentions full-grown sows under the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεταλίδες ὕες</foreign> in Aethon, a satyric drama, where he says—

                  <pb n="v.2.p.593"/> But he has given the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεταλίδες</foreign> by a metaphor from heifers. For they are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέτηλοι,</foreign> or spreading, from their horns, when they have
                  spreading horns. And Eratosthenes has spoken of pigs in the same way as Achæus has
                  in his Anterinnys, and has called them <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαρινοὶ,</foreign>
                  using this word metaphorically, which properly belongs to fatted oxen which were
                  called so from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαπινεύομαι,</foreign> which is a
                  word of the same meaning as <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιτίζομαι,</foreign> to be fed

               <p>And once when a pig was served up before us, the half of which was being carefully
                  roasted, and the other half boiled gently, as if it had been steamed, and when all
                  marvelled at the cleverness of the cook, he being very proud of his skill,
                  said—And, indeed, there is not one of you who can point out the place where he
                  received the death wound; or where his belly was cut so as to be stuffed with all
                  sorts of dainties. For it has thrushes in it, and other birds; and it has also in
                  it parts of the abdomens of pigs, and slices of a sow's womb, and the yolks of
                  eggs, and moreover the entrails of birds, with their ovaries, those also being
                  full of delicate seasoning, and also pieces of meat shred into thin shavings and
                  seasoned with pepper. For I am afraid to use the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσίκια</foreign> before Ulpian, although I know that he himself is very fond
                  of the thing. And, indeed, my favourite author Paxamus speaks of it by this name,
                  and I myself do not care much about using no words but such as are strictly Attic.
                  Do you, therefore, show me now how this pig was killed, and how I contrived to
                  roast half of him and to boil the other side. And as we kept on examining him, the
                  cook said,—But do you think that I know less about my business than the ancient

                     <l>Must the sublimer sciences have learnt:</l>
                     <l>He must know when the stars do set and rise,</l>
                     <l>And why. Moreover, when the sun returns,</l>
                     <l>Causing the long and short days on the earth;</l>
                     <l>And in what figures of the zodiac</l>
                     <l>He is from time to time. For, men do say</l>
                     <l>All fish, and every meat and herb we eat,</l>
                     <l>Have different qualities at different seasons</l>
                     <l>Of the revolving year; and he who knows</l>
                     <l>The principles and reasons of these things</l>
                     <l>Will use each meat when it is most in season;</l>
                     <l>And he who knows them not, but acts at random,</l>
                     <l>Is always laugh'd at most deservedly.</l>
                     <l>Perhaps, too, you don't know wherein the science</l>

               <p>I wonder if it was any of these second seven wise men who contrived this device

                  roast one side of him and boil the other at the same time. And as we now urged and
                  entreated him to explain this clever device to us, he said,—I will not tell you
                  this year, I swear by those who encountered danger at Marathon, and also by those
                  who fought at Salamis. So when he had taken such an oath as that, we all thought
                  we ought not to press the man; but all began to lay hands on the different dishes
                  which were served up before us. And Ulpian said,—I swear by those who encountered
                  danger at Artemisium, no one shall taste of anything before we are told in what
                  ancient author the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραφέρω</foreign> is used in the

                  think I am the only person who knows anything about that. And Magnus said,

               <p>On this the cook said—I, then, will relate to you now, not an ancient contrivance,
                  but a device of my own, in order that the flute-player may escape being beaten;
                  (for Eubulus, in his Lacedæmonians or Leda, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But I have heard of this, I swear by Vesta,</l>
                     <l>That when the cook at home makes any blunder,</l>
                     <l>The flute-player is always beaten for it.</l>
                  </quote> And Philyllius, or whoever the poet may have been who wrote the play of
                  The Cities, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Whatever blunders now the cook may make,</l>
                     <l>The flute-player receives the stripes for them.)</l>
                  </quote> And I mean the device about the pig half-roasted, half-boiled, and
                  stuffed, without having had any apparent incision made in him. The fact is, the
                  pig was stuck with a very short wound under his shoulder; (and he showed the
                  wound.) Then when the greater part of the blood had flowed from it, all the
                  entrails, with the intestines, I washed (and the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαίρεσις</foreign>, O you revellers who think so much of words, means <pb n="v.2.p.600"/> not only a taking out, but also the entrails themselves) care-
                  fully in wine several times, and hung the pig up by his feet. Then again I washed
                  him in wine; and having boiled up beforehand all the seasonings which I have
                  spoken of with a good deal of pepper, I pushed them in at his mouth, pouring in
                  afterwards a quantity of broth very carefully made. And after this I plastered
                  over one-half of the pig, as you see, with a great quantity of barleymeal, having
                  soaked that in wine and oil. And then I put it in an oven, placing under it a
                  brazen table, and I roasted it at a gentle fire, so as not to burn it, nor, on the
                  other hand, to take it away before it was quite done. And when the skin began to
                  get roasted and brown, I conjectured that the other side was boiled enough. And so
                  then I took off the barleymeal, and brought it up in that condition and set it
                  before you.</p>

                  his discourse, and for the exceeding perfection of his skill, our excellent
                  entertainer Laurentius said—And how much better it is for cooks to learn such
                  things as these, than as they do with one whom I could mention of our
                  fellow-citizens, who having had his head turned by riches and luxury, compelled
                  his cooks to learn the dialogues of the incomparable Plato, and when they were
                  bringing in dishes to say, <quote>One, two, three, but where is the fourth, O most
                     excellent Timæus, of those who were guests yesterday, but who are hosts

                     Socrates,</quote> —and so they went through the whole dialogue in this manner,
                  so that those who were at the feast were very indignant, arid so that that
                  all-accomplished man was laughed at and insulted every day, and that on this
                  account many most respectable men refused all invitations to his entertainments.
                  But these cooks of ours, who are perhaps just as well instructed in these things
                  as he was, give us no little pleasure. And then the slave who had been praised for

                  us of a similar kind to this and is not my behaviour moderate enough, since I do

               <p>But the race of cooks are really very curious for the most part about the
                  histories and names of things. Accordingly the most learned of them say,

                  enjoyed his skill and the specimens of his art which he had invented. And Alexis,

               <p>We must now speak of the goose. For as many geese were served up very excellently
                  dressed, some one said, Look at the fat geese (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σιτευτοὶ
                     χῆνες</foreign>). And Ulpian said, Where do you ever find the expression
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιτευτὸς χήν?</foreign> And Plutarch <pb n="v.2.p.604"/>
                  answered him:—Theopompus the Chian, in his History of Greece, and in the
                  thirteenth book of his History of the Affairs and Exploits of Philip, says that
                  the Egyptians sent to Agesilaus the Lacedæmonian, when he arrived in Egypt, some
                  fatted (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σιτευτοὺς</foreign>) calves and geese (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χῆνας</foreign>). And Epigenes the comic poet says in his

                     <l>But if a person were to take me like</l>

                        be roasted thoroughly.</l>
                  </quote> But we have a right now, O Ulpian, to expect you to tell us, you who
                  question everybody about everything, where this very costly dish of the livers of
                  geese has been mentioned by any ancient writer. For Cratinus is a witness that
                  they were acquainted with people whose business it was to feed geese, in his
                  Dionysalexander, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>And Homer uses the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χὴν</foreign> in both the masculine
                  and feminine gender; for he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                        off a lazy goose.</l>
                  </quote> And again he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And in another place he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Who in my house eat wheat, and fatten fast.</l>
                  </quote> And Eupolis mentions the livers of geese (and they are thought an
                  excessive delicacy at Rome), in his Women Selling Garlands, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>There were also heads of pigs split in half and served up as a dish. And this dish

                  </quote> After these things there was served up a haricot, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεωκάκκαβος.</foreign> And this dish consists of meat chopped up
                  with blood and fat, in a sauce richly sweetened: and Aristophanes the Grammarian
                  says that it was the Achæans who <pb n="v.2.p.605"/> gave this name to the dish.
                  But Anticlides, in the seventy-eighth book of his Returns, says, “Once when there
                  was a design on the part of the Erythreans to put the Chians to death by treachery

                  </quote> And Aristomenes, in his Jugglers, makes mention in the following terms of

                  * * They used also to eat the testicles of animals, which they called <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέφροι.</foreign>—Philippodes, in his Renovation, speaking of the

                  was fond of finding fault, and who was reclining on a couch by himself, eating
                  little, but watching the rest of the guests, said—What is that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξυλίπαρον</foreign> you speak of? unless indeed you give that

                  Ulpian, picking out the small bones, and contracting his brows, said,—here do you

                  him to settle that as he pleased, and themselves preferred eating; while Cynulcus

                  there is nothing to do, that they may live there; and so they take a fancy to the
                  life among the birds. And accordingly they come to the birds: and when all of a
                  sudden some wild bird flies towards them, they, alarmed at the sight, comfort one
                  another, and say a great many things, and among them they say this— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Miserable Man. <pb n="v.2.p.609"/> And Mnesimachus, in his play called Philip,

                     also some such difference as this in birds. For the heavy birds which are not

                     the pheasant, are very well adapted for walking and have thick plumage.</quote>
                  And Aristotle, in the eighth book of his History of Animals, writes
                     thus:—<quote>Now of birds there are some which are fond of dusting themselves,
                     and some which are fond of washing, and some which neither dust nor wash
                     themselves. And those which are not good flyers, but which keep chiefly on the
                     ground, are fond of dusting themselves; such as the common fowl, the partridge,
                     the woodcock, the pheasant, the lark.</quote> Speusippus also mentions them in

                     having been let loose in the woods there, for some time uttered a sound like a

                     great many of the natives of the country died, they never ceased uttering, as
                     they do to this day, in a voice more distinct than that of the very clearest
                     speaking children, ' Threefold evils to the wicked doers.' But when they are
                     caught it is not only impossible to tame them, but they even cease to utter any

            <div type="chapter" n="40">
               <p>There is also a bird called the porphyrion. And it is well known that this bird is
                  mentioned by Aristophanes. And Polemo, in the fifth book of his treatise addressed
                  to Antigonus and Adæus, says that the bird called the porphyrion, when it is kept
                  in a house, watches those women who have husbands very closely; and has such
                  instantaeous perception of any one who commits adultery, that, when it perceives
                  it, it gives notice of it to the master of the house, cutting its own existence
                  short by hanging itself. And, says he, it never partakes of food before it has
                  walked all round the place seeking for some spot which may suit it; land then it
                  dusts itself there, and washes itself, and after that it feeds. And Aristotle says
                  that it has cloven feet, and that it is of a dark blue colour, with long legs,
                  with a beak of a scarlet colour beginning at its very head; of about the size of a
                  cock of the common poultry-breed; and it has a small Gullet, on which account it
                  seizes its food with its foot, and divides it into diminutive morsels. And it
                  drinks greedily and it has five toes on each foot, of which the middle one is the
                  largest. But Alexander the Myndian, in the second book of his treatise on the
                  History of Birds, says that the bird comes originally from Libya, and that it is
                  sacred to the gods of Libya.</p>
               <p>There is also another bird called the porphyris. Callimachus, in his treatise on
                  Birds, says that the porphyris is different from the porphyrion, and enumerates
                  the two birds separately. And he says that the porphyrion takes its food while
                  hiding itself in darkness, so that no one may see it; for it hates those who come
                  near its food. And Aristophanes also mentions the porphyris in his drama entitled
                  The Birds. And Ibycus speaks of some birds which he calls lathipor-phyrides, and
                  says; There are some variegated ducks with purple necks which frequent the highest
                  branches of the trees; and the birds called lathiporphyrides with variegated
                  necks, and king-fishers with extended wings." And in another place he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You're always bearing me aloft, my mind,</l>
                     <l>Like some bold porphyris, with out-stretch'd wings.</l>

               <p>The next bird is the partridge. A great many authors mention this bird, as also
                  does Aristophanes. And some of <pb n="v.2.p.612"/> them in the oblique cases
                  shorten the penultima of the noun; as Archilochus does where he writes— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And Aristotle gives the following account of the bird— "The partridge is
                  a land bird, with cloven feet; and he lives fifteen years: but the female lives
                  even more. For among all birds the female lives longer than the male. It lays
                  eggs, and hatches its young itself, as the common hen does. And when it is aware
                  that it is being hunted, it comes away from its nest, and rolls near the legs of
                  the huntsman, giving him a hope that he may catch it; and so it deceives him,
                  until its young have flown away, and then it flies away itself also.</p>

                  <quote>But it is a very ill-disposed and cunning animal; and moreover it is much
                     devoted to amatory enjoyments; on which account it breaks the eggs of its hen,
                     that it may not be deprived of her while she is hatching them; and therefore
                     the hen, knowing this, runs away and hides her eggs.</quote> And Callimachus
                  gives the same account in his treatise on Birds. And the single birds fight with
                  one another, and the one which is defeated becomes the mate of the conqueror. But
                  Aristotle says that they all in turn use the bird which has been defeated as their
                  mate, and that the tame birds also <pb n="v.2.p.613"/> take the wild ones for
                  their mates. And the bird which is defeated by the other patiently allows itself
                  to be treated by him as his mate. And this happens at a particular time of the
                  year, as is also stated by Alexander the Myndian. And they lay their eggs on the
                  ground, both the cocks and the hens making themselves separate nests. And the
                  leader of the wild birds attacks the decoy partridge, and when he is taken another
                  comes forward to fight the decoy bird; and this is done whenever the bird used for
                  the decoy is a cock bird; but when a hen is employed for the purpose, then she
                  crows till the leader of the wild birds meets her, and the rest of the wild birds
                  assemble and drive him away from the hen, because he is attending to her and not
                  to them; on which account sometimes he advances without making any noise, in order
                  that no other bird may hear his voice and come to fight him. And sometimes the hen
                  also checks the crowing of the cock as he comes up:<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Schweighaeuser thinks, with apparent reason, that there is some
                     corruption in the text here.</note> and very often when she is sitting on her
                  nest she gets off it on perceiving the cock approaching the decoy bird, and
                  remains there to receive his embraces in order to draw him away from the decoy
                  bird. And so very eager to propagate their species are both quails and partridges,
                  that they fall into the hands of the hunters on that account, sitting on the
                  tiles. They say, too, that when hen partridges are taken out to hunt, even when
                  they see or smell a cock standing or flying down the wind, become pregnant, and
                  some say that they immediately begin to lay eggs. And about breeding time they fly
                  about with their mouths open, putting out their tongues, both hens and cocks. And
                  Clearchus says, in his treatise on Panic Fear,—<quote>Sparrows and partridges, and
                     also the common barn-door fowl and the quail, are eager to propagate their
                     species, not only the moment that they see the hen, but even as soon as hey
                     hear her voice. And the cause of this is the excessive impression made on their
                     minds by amatory pleasures and proximity. And you may see more easily all that
                     takes place with respect to the propagation of their species if you put a
                     looking-glass opposite to them. For they run forward, being deceived by the
                     appearance, and behave as if they saw a hen, and so are caught. Only the common
                     poultry cock does not <pb n="v.2.p.614"/> do so. But the perception of the
                     reflected image operates on them only so far as to make them wish to
                     fight.</quote> And this is the statement of Clearchus.</p>

               <p>Partridges are by some people called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάκκαβαι,</foreign> as,
                  for instance, by Alcman, who speaks as follows— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Alcman, too, began the strain;</l>
                     <l>And he introduced into the language</l>
                     <l>The compound name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακκαβίδες</foreign>:</l>
                  </quote> showing plainly enough that he had learnt to compound the word from the
                  noise made by partridges. On which account also Chamæleon of Pontus said that the
                  discovery of music was originally made by the ancients from the birds singing in
                  desert places; by imitation of whom they arrived at the art of music; but it is
                  not all partridges who make the noise called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακκαβίζειν,</foreign> or cackling. At all events, Theophrastus, in his
                  treatise on the Different Noises made by Animals of the same Species,
                     says—<quote>The partridges in Attica, near Corydallus, on the side towards the
                     city, cackle; but those on the other side twitter.</quote> And Basilis, in the
                  second book of his History of India, says—<quote>The diminutive men in those
                     countries which fight with cranes are often carried by partridges.</quote> And
                  Menecles, in the first book of his Collectanea, says—<quote>The pygmies fight both
                     with partridges and with cranes.</quote> But there is a different kind of
                  partridge found in Italy, of a dark colour on its wings, and smaller in size, with
                  a beak inclining in the smallest possible degree to a red colour. But the
                  partridges about Cirrha are not at all nice to eat as to their flesh, on account
                  of the nature of their food. But the partridges in Bœotia either do not cross into
                  Attica at all, or else, whenever they do, they are easily recognised by their
                  voices, as we have previously mentioned. But the partridges which are found in
                  Paphlagonia, Theophrastus says, have two hearts. But those in the island of
                  Sciathos feed on cockles. And sometimes they have as many as fifteen or sixteen
                  young at a time; and they can only fly short distances, as Xenophon tells us in
                  the first book of his Anabasis, where he writes,— <quote>But if any one rouses the
                     bustard suddenly it is easy to catch him; for they can only fly a short
                     distance, like partridges, and they very soon tire; but their flesh is very
                     delicious.</quote>

            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="44">
               <p>And Plutarch says that Xenophon is quite correct <pb n="v.2.p.615"/> about the
                  bustard; for that great numbers of these birds are brought to Alexandria from the
                  adjacent parts o Libya; being hunted and caught in this manner. The animal is a
                  very imitative one, the bustard; being especially fond of imitating whatever it
                  sees a man do; and accordingly it does whatever it sees the hunters do. And they,
                  standing opposite to it, anoint themselves under the eyes with some unguent,
                  having prepared other different unguents calculated to close up the eyes and
                  eyelids; and these other unguents they place in shallow dishes near the bustards.
                  And so the bustards, seeing the men anoint themselves under the eyes, do the same
                  thing also themselves, taking the unguents out of these dishes; and by this means
                  they are quickly caught. And Aristotle writes the following account of
                     them:—<quote>It is a migratory bird, with cloven feet, and three toes; of about
                     the size of a large cock, of the colour of a quail, with a long head, a sharp
                     beak, a thin neck, large eyes, a bony tongue, and it has no crop.</quote> But
                  Alexander the Myndian says that it is also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγωδίας.</foreign> And he says, also, that it ruminates, and that it is very
                  fond of the horse; and that if any one puts on a horse's skin he can catch as many
                  as he pleases; for they come up to him then of their own accord. And presently, in
                  another passage, Aristotle tells us, <quote>The bustard is something like the owl,
                     but it is not a bird which flies by night; and it has large feathers about its
                     ears, on which account it is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦτος,</foreign> from
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦτα;</foreign> and it is about the size of a pigeon,
                     and a great imitator of mankind; and accordingly it is caught by dancing
                     opposite to them.'</quote> And it is in shape something like a man, and it is
                  an imitator of whatever man does. On which account the comic poets call those
                  people who are easily taken in by any one whom they chance to meet, a bustard.
                  Accordingly, in hunting them, the man who is cleverest at it, stands opposite to
                  them and dances; and the birds, looking at the man dancing, move like puppets
                  pulled by strings; and then some one comes behind them, and, without being
                  perceived, seizes on them while they are wholly occupied with the delight they
                  derive from the imitation.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="45">
               <p>They say, also, that the screech-owl does the same thing: for it is said that they
                  also are caught by dancing. And Homer mentions them. And there is a kind of dance,
                     <pb n="v.2.p.616"/> which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκὼψ,</foreign> or
                  the screech-owl, from them; deriving its name from the variety of motion displayed
                  by this animal. And the screech-owls also delight in imitation, and it is from
                  their name that we say that those men <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκώπτουσι,</foreign>
                  who keep looking at the person whom they wish to turn into ridicule, and mock all
                  his conduct by an exact imitation, copying the conduct of those birds. But all the
                  birds whose tongues are properly formed, and who are capable of uttering
                  articulate sounds, imitate the voices of men and of other birds; as the parrot and
                  the jay. The screech-owl, as Alexander the Myndian says, is smaller than the
                  common owl, and he has whitish spots on a leaden-coloured plumage; and he puts out
                  two tufts of feathers from his eyebrows on each temple. Now Callimachus says that
                  there are two kinds of screech-owls, and that one kind does screech, and the other
                  does not—on which account one kind is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκῶπες,</foreign> and the other kind is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀείσκωπες,</foreign> and these last are of a grey colour.</p>
               <p>But Alexander the Myndian says that the name is written in Homer, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κῶπες</foreign> without the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς,</foreign> and
                  that that was the name which Aristotle gave them; and that they are constantly
                  seen, and that they are not eatable; but that those which are only seen about the
                  end of autumn for a day or two are eatable. And they differ from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀείσκωπες</foreign> in their speed, and they are something like
                  the turtle-dove and the pigeon in pace. And Speusippus, in the second book of his
                  treatise on Things Resembling one another, also calls them <foreign xml:lang="grc">κῶπες</foreign> without the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>. But Epicharmus
                  writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκῶπας,</foreign> epopses and owls. And Metrodorus,
                  in his treatise on Custom and Habituation, says, that the screech-owl is caught by
                  dancing opposite to it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="46">
               <p>But since, when we were talking of partridges, we mentioned that they were
                  exceedingly amorous birds, we ought also to add, that the cock of the common
                  poultry fowl is a very amorous bird too; at all events Aristotle says, that when
                  cocks are kept in the temples as being dedicated to the Gods, the cocks who were
                  there before treat any new comer as a hen until another is dedicated in a similar
                  manner. And if none are dedicated, then they fight together, and the one which has
                  defeated the other works his will on the one which he has defeated. It is related,
                  also, that a cock, whenever he goes in at any door whatever, always stoops his
                  crest, and that <pb n="v.2.p.617"/> one cock never yields to another without a
                  battle; but Theophrastus says, that the wild cocks are still more amorous than the
                  tame ones. He says, also, that the cocks are most inclined to pursue the hens the
                  moment they leave their perch in the morning, but the hens prefer it as the day
                  advances.</p>
               <p>Sparrows, also, are very amorous birds; on which account Terpsicles says, that
                  those who eat sparrows are rendered exceedingly prone to amorous indulgences; and
                  perhaps it is from such an idea that Sappho represents Venus as being drawn by
                  sparrows yoked in her chariot; for they are very amorous birds, and very prolific.
                  The sparrow has about eight young ones at one hatching, according to the statement
                  of Aristotle. And Alexander the Myndian says that there are two kinds of sparrows,
                  the one a tame species, and the other a wild one; and he adds that the hen-sparrow
                  is weaker in other respects, and also that their beaks are of a more horny colour,
                  and that their faces are not very white, nor very black; but Aristotle says that
                  the cock-sparrow never appears in the winter, but that the hen-sparrows remain,
                  drawing his conclusions as to what he thinks probable from their colour; for their
                  colour changes, as the colour of blackbirds and of coots does, who get whiter at
                  certain seasons. But the people of Elis call sparrows <foreign xml:lang="grc">δείρηται,</foreign> as Nicander the Colophonian tells us in the third book of
                  his treatise on Different Dialects.</p>

                  those which have not this characteristic make the genitive with a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γ,</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρτυξ ὄρτυγος, κόκκυξ

                  same if the last syllable does not begin with a consonant at all.</p>
               <p>But with respect to the quail Aristotle says, <quote>The quail is a migratory
                     bird, with cloven feet, and he does not make a nest, but lies in the dust; and
                     he covers over his hole with sticks for fear of hawks; and then the hen lays
                     her eggs in the hole.</quote> But Alexander the Myndian says, in the second
                  book of his treatise on Animals, <quote>The female quail has a thin neck, not
                     having under its chin the same black feathers which the male has. And when it
                     is dissected it is found not to have a large crop, but it has a large heart
                     with three lobes; it has also its liver and its gall-bladder united in its
                     intestines, but it has but a small spleen, and one which is not easily
                     perceived; and its testicles are under its liver, like those of the common
                     fowl.</quote> And concerning their origin, Phanodemus, in the second book of
                  his History of Attica, says:— <quote>When Erysichthon saw the island of Delos,
                     which was by the ancients called Ortygia, because of the numerous flocks of
                     quails which came over the sea and settled in that island as one which afforded
                     them good shelter . . .</quote> And Eudoxus the Cnidian, in the first book of
                  his Description of the Circuit of the Earth, says that the Phœnicians sacrifice
                  quails to Hercules, because Hercules, the son of Asteria and Jupiter, when on his
                  way towards Libya, was slain by Typhon and restored to life by Iolaus, who brought
                  a quail to him and put it to his nose, and the smell revived him. For when he was
                  alive he was, says Eudoxus, very partial to that bird.</p>

                  voices in the Phliasian or Lacedæmonian country as partridges have; and perhaps it
                  is from this, also, that the bird called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίαλις</foreign>
                  has its name, as <pb n="v.2.p.619"/> Didymus says. For nearly all birds derive

                  </quote> And Alexander the Myndian also mentions it, and says that in size it is
                  nearly equal to a turtle-dove; that it has long legs, a slender body, and is very
                  timid. And with respect to the hunting for quails, Clearchus the Solensian
                  mentions some very singular circumstances, in his book which is entitled <quote>A
                     Treatise on those things which have been asserted on Mathematical Principles in
                     Plato's Polity,</quote> where he writes as follows—<quote>Quails, about
                     breeding time, if any one puts a looking-glass opposite to them, and a noose in
                     front of it, run towards the bird which is seen in the looking-glass; and so
                     fall into the noose.</quote> And about the birds called jackdaws he makes a
                  similar statement, saying—<quote>And a very similar thing happens to the jackdaws,
                     on account of their naturally affectionate disposition towards each other. For
                     they are a most exceedingly cunning bird; nevertheless when a bowl full of oil
                     is placed near them, they stand on the edge of the bowl, and look down, and
                     then rush down towards the bird which appears visible in the liquid. In
                     consequence of which, when they are soaked through with the oil, their wings
                     stick together and cause them to be easily captured.</quote> And the Attic

               <p>And even swans in great plenty were not wanting <pb n="v.2.p.620"/> to our
                  banquets. And Aristotle speaks in the following manner of this bird—<quote>The
                     swan is a prolific bird, and a quarrelsome one. And, indeed, they are so fond
                     of fighting that they often kill one another. And the swan will fight even the
                     eagle; though he does not begin the battle himself. And they are tuneful birds,
                     especially towards the time of their death. And they also cross the seas
                     singing. And they are web-footed, and feed on herbage.</quote> But Alexander
                  the Myndian says, that though he followed a great many swans when they were dying,
                  he never heard one sing. And Hegesianax of Alexandria, who arranged the book of
                  Cephalion, called the History of Troy, says that the Cycnus who fought with
                  Achilles in single combat, was fed in Leucophrys by the bird of the same name,
                  that is, by the swan. But Boius, or Boio, which Philochorus says was his proper
                  name, in his book on the Origin of Birds, says that Cycnus was turned into a bird
                  by Mars, and that when he came to the river Sybaris he was cooped with a crane.
                  And he says, also, that the swan lines his nest with that particular grass which
                  is called lygæa.</p>
               <p>And concerning the crane (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γέρανος</foreign>), Boius says
                  that there was among the Pygmies a very well known woman whose name was Gerana.
                  And she, being honoured as a god by her fellow-countrymen, thought lightly of
                  those who were really gods, and especially of Juno and Diana. And accordingly
                  Juno, being indignant, metamorphosed her into an unsightly bird, and made her
                  hostile to and hated by the Pygmies who had been used to honour her. And he says,
                  also, that of her and Nicodamas was born the land tortoise. And as a general rule,
                  the man who composed all these fables asserts that all the birds were formerly

               <p>The next bird to be mentioned is the pigeon. Aristotle says, that there is but one
                  genus of the pigeon, but five subordinate species; writing thus—<quote>The pigeon,
                     the œnas, the phaps, the dove, and the turtle-dove.</quote> But in the fifth
                  book of his treatise on the Parts of Animals, he makes no mention of the phaps,
                  though Aeschylus, in his tragedy called Proteus, does mention that bird in the
                  following line— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Feeding the wretched miserable phaps,</l>
                     <l>Entangled as to its poor broken sides</l>
                     <l>Within the winnowing spokes.</l>
                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.2.p.621"/> And in his Philoctetes he uses the word in the genitive case
                  plural, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαβῶν.</foreign>
                  <quote>The œonas, then,</quote> says Aristotle, <quote>is something larger than
                     the pigeon, and it has a puce-coloured plumage; but the phaps is something
                     between the pigeon and the œnas. And the species called phassa is about as
                     large as the common cock, but of the colour of ashes; and the turtledove is
                     less than all the other species, and is o a cinder-colour. And this last is
                     only seen in the summer, and during the winter it keeps in its hole. Now, the
                     phaps and the common pigeon are always to be seen, but the œnas is only visible
                     in the autumn. And the species called the phassa is said to be longer lived
                     than any of the others; for it lives thirty or forty years. And the cock birds
                     never leave the hens to the day of their death, nor do the hens ever desert the
                     cock: but when one dies the other remains solitary: and crows, and ravens, and
                     jackdaws all do the same thing. And in every kind of the genus pigeon, both
                     male and female sit on the eggs in turn; and when the chickens are hatched, the
                     cock bird spits upon them to prevent their being fascinated. And the hen lays
                     two eggs, the first of which produces a cock and the second a hen. And they lay
                     at every season of the year; so that they lay ten or eleven times a year; and
                     in Egypt they lay twelve times; for the hen conceives again the very next day
                     to that in which it lays.</quote> And further on, in the same book, Aristotle
                  says that the kind called <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστερὰ</foreign> differs from
                  the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειὰς,</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειὰς</foreign> is the least of the two. And the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειὰς</foreign> is easily tamed; but the <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστερὰ</foreign> is black, and small, and has red rough legs; on which
                  account no one keeps them. But he mentions a peculiarity of the species called
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστερὰ,</foreign> that they kiss one another when
                  courting, and that if the males neglect this, the hens do not admit their
                  embraces. However, old doves do not go through this formality; but omit the kisses
                  and still succeed in their suit, but the younger ones always kiss before they
                  proceed to action. And the hens, too, make love to one another, when there is no
                  cock at hand, kissing one another beforehand. But still, as there are no real
                  results, the eggs which they lay never produce chickens. The Dorians, however,
                  consider the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειὰς</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστερὰ</foreign> as identical; and Sophron uses the two words as synonymous
                  in his Female Actresses. But Callimachus, in his treatise on Birds, speaks of the
                  pyrallis, the <pb n="v.2.p.622"/> dove, the wood-pigeon, and the turtle-dove, as
                  all different from one another.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="51">
               <p>But Alexander the Myndian says, that the pigeon never lifts up his head when it
                  drinks, as the turtle-dove does; and that it never utters any sound in the winter
                  except when it is very fine weather. It is said, also, that when the species
                  called œnas has eaten the seed of the mistletoe, and then leaves its droppings on
                  any tree, mistletoe after that grows upon that tree. But Daimachus, in his history
                  of India, says that pigeons of an apple-green colour are found in India. And
                  Charon of Lampsacus, in his history of Persia, speaking of Mardonius, and of the
                  losses which the Persian army sustained Off Mount Athos, writes as
                     follows—<quote>And that was the first time that white pigeons were ever seen by
                     the Greeks; as they had never existed in that country.</quote> And Aristotle
                  says, that the pigeons, when their young are born, eat a lot of earth impregnated
                  with salt, and then open the mouths of their young and spit the salt into them;
                  and by this means prepare them to swallow and digest their food. And at Eryx in
                  Sicily, there is a certain time which the Sicilians call The Departure, at which
                  time they say that the Goddess is departing into Africa: and at this time all the
                  pigeons about the place disappear, as if they had accompanied the Goddess on her
                  journey. And after nine days, when the festival called <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταγώγια,</foreign> that is to say The Return, is celebrated, after one
                  pigeon has first arrived, flying across the sea like an <hi rend="italics">avant-courier,</hi> and has flown into the temple, the rest follow speedily.
                  And on this, all the inhabitants around, who are comfortably off, feast; and the
                  rest clap their hands for joy. And at that time the whole place smells of butter,
                  which they use as a sort of token of the return of the Goddess. But Autocrates, in
                  his history of Achaia, says that Jupiter once changed his form into that of a
                  pigeon, when he was in love with a maiden in Aegium, whose name was Phthia. But
                  the Attic writers use the word also in the masculine gender, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστερός.</foreign> Alexis, in his People Running together, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>We must also mention ducks. The male of these birds, as Alexander the Myndian
                  says, is larger than the female, and has a more richly coloured plumage: but the
                  bird which is called the glaucion, from the colour of its. eyes, is a little
                  smaller than the duck. And of the species called boscades the male is marked all
                  over with lines, and he also is less than the duck; and the males have short
                  beaks, too small to be in fair proportion to their size: but the small diver is
                  the least of all aquatic birds, being of a dirty black plumage, and it has a sharp
                  beak, turning upwards towards the eyes, and it goes a great deal under water.
                  There is also another species of the boscades, larger than the duck, but smaller
                  than the chenalopex: but the species which are called phascades are a little
                  larger than the small divers, but in all other respects they resemble the ducks.
                  And the kind called uria are not much smaller than the duck, but as to its plumage
                  it is of a dirty earthenware colour, and it has a log and narrow beak: but the

                  <quote>The peacock,</quote> says Aristotle, <quote>is cloven-footed, and feeds on
                     herbage; it begins to breed when it is three years old, at which age it also
                     gets the rich and varied colours of its plumage; and it sits on its eggs about
                     thirty days, and once a-year it lays twelve eggs, and it lays these not all at
                     once, but at intervals, laying every third day. But the first year of a hen's
                     laying she does not lay more than eight eggs; and she sometimes lays wind eggs
                     like the common hen, but never more than two; and she sits upon her eggs and
                     hatches them very much in the same way as the common hen does.</quote> And
                  Eupolis, in his Deserters from the Army, speaks of the peacock in the following
                  terms— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Lest I should keep in Pluto's realm,</l>
                     <l>A peacock such as this, who wakes the sleepers.</l>
                  </quote> And there is a speech extant, by Antiphanes the orator, which is
                  entitled, On Peacocks. And in that speech there is not one express mention of the
                  name peacock, but he repeatedly speaks of them in it as birds of variegated
                  plumage, saying— <quote>That Demus, the son of Pyrilampes, breeds these birds, and
                     that out of a desire to see these birds, a great many people come from
                     Lacedæmon and from Thessaly, and show great anxiety to get some of the
                     eggs.</quote> And with respect to their appearance he writes thus—<quote>If any
                     one wishes to remove these birds into a city, they will fly away and depart;
                     and if he cuts their wings he takes away their beauty. For their wings are
                     their beauty, and not their body.</quote> And that people used to be very
                  anxious to see them he tells us subsequently in the same book, where he says;
                     <quote>But at the time of the festival of the new moon, any one who likes is
                     admitted to see them, but on other days if any one comes and wishes to see them
                     he is never allowed to do so; and this is not a <pb n="v.2.p.627"/> custom of

                  </quote> as Tryphon tells us, <quote>circumflexing and aspirating the last
                     syllable. And they read it spelt in this way in the Deserters from the Army of
                     Eupolis, in the passage which has been already quoted, and in the Birds of
                     Aristophanes— <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <l>A bird then; what kind? is it not a peacock (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὧς</foreign>)?</l>
                     </quote> But in the dative they say <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὧνι,</foreign> as
                     Aristophanes does in the same play. But it is quite impossible in the Attic or
                     Ionic dialects that, in nouns which have more than one syllable, the last
                     syllable beginning with a vowel should be aspirated; for it is quite inevitable
                     that it should be pronounced with a lene breathing, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεὢς, λεὢς, τυνδάρεὠς, μενέλεὠς, λειπόνεὠς,</foreign>
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔνεὠς, νείλεὠς, πρᾶὀς, ὑίὀς, κεῖὀς, χῖὀς, δῖὀς, χρεῖὀς,
                        πλεῖὀς, λεῖὀς,</foreign>
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαιὄς, βαιὂς, φαιὂς, πηὂς, γόὀς, θοὂς, ῥόὀς,
                        ζωὄς.</foreign> For the aspirate is fond of beginning a word, and is by
                     nature inclined to the lead, and is never included in the last part of a word.
                     And the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὧς</foreign> is derived from the extension
                        (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τάσις</foreign>) of the wings.</quote> And Seleucus,
                  in the fifth book of his treatise on Hellenisms, says: <quote>The peacock,
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὧς</foreign>:—but the Attics, contrary to all rule,
                     both aspirate and circumflex the last syllable; but the aspirate is only
                     attached to the first vowel, when it begins a word in the simple pronunciation
                     of the word, and there taking the lead, and running on more swiftly, it has the
                     first place in the word. Accordingly, the Athenians, in consequence of this
                     arrangement, observing the inherent character of this breathing, do not put it
                        <hi rend="italics">on</hi> vowels, as they do often accents and breathings,
                     but put it before them. And I think that the ancients used to mark the aspirate
                     by the character H, on which account the Romans write the letter H at the
                     beginning of all aspirated nouns, showing its predominan nature; and if this be
                     the proper character of the aspirate, it is plain that it is contrary to all
                     reason and analogy that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῶς</foreign> has any
                     breathing at all marked upon it by the Attic writers.</quote>

                  species of plant, a species of bird, a species of stone;) Laurentius said—And I,
                  my good friend, am aware that the admirable Aristophanes, in his Birds, mentions
                  the grouse in the following lines— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>With the porphyrion and the pelican,</l>

                     <l>The grouse and peacock.</l>
                  </quote> But I wish to learn from you whether there is any mention of the bird in
                  any other author. For Alexander the Myndian, in the second book of his treatise on
                  Winged Animals, speaks of it as a bird of no great size, but rather as one of the
                  smaller birds. For his words are these—<quote>The grouse, a bird about the size of
                     rook, of an earthenware colour, variegated with dirty coloured spots, and long
                     lines, feeding on fruit; and when it lays its eggs it cackles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τετράζει</foreign>). from which it derives its name (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τέτραξ</foreign>).</quote> And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's
                  Wedding, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For when you've taken quails and sparrows too,</l>
                     <l>And larks who love to robe themselves in dust,</l>
                     <l>And grouse, and rooks, and beauteous fig-peckers.</l>
                  </quote> And in another passage he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There were the herons with their long bending necks,</l>
                     <l>A numerous flock; and grouse, and rooks besides.</l>
                  </quote> But since none of you have anything to say on the subject (as you are all
                  silent), I will show you the bird itself; for when I was the Emperor's Procurator
                  in Mysia, and the super- intendent of all the affairs of that province, I saw the
                  bird in that country. And learning that it was called by this name among the
                  Mysians and Pæonians, I recollected what the bird was by the description given of
                  it by Aristophanes. And believing that this bird was considered by the
                  all-accomplished Aristotle worthy of being mentioned in that work of his worth
                  many talents (for it is said that the Stagirite received eight hundred talents
                  from Alexander as his contribution towards perfecting his History of Animals),
                  when I found that there was no mention of it in this work, I was delighted at
                  having the <pb n="v.2.p.629"/> admirable Aristophanes as an unimpeachable witness
                  in the matter. And while he was saying this, a slave came in bringing in the
                  grouse in a basket; but it was in size larger than the largest cock of the common
                  poultry, and in appearance it was very like the porphyrion; and it had wattles
                  hanging from its ears on each side like the common cock; and its voice was loud
                  and harsh. And so after we had admired the beauty of the bird, in a short time one
                  was served up on the table dressed; and the meat of him was like that of the
                  ostrich, which we were often in the habit of eating.</p>

                  who wrote the poem called The Return of the Atridæ, in the third book says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And with his rapid feet Hermioneus</l>

                     <quote>The flesh of the loins which stands out on each side is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψύαι,</foreign> and the hollows on each side they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύβοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάλλιαι.</foreign>
                  </quote> And Clearchus, in the second book of his treatise on The Joints in the
                  Human Body, speaks thus: <quote>There is flesh full of muscle on each side; which
                     some people call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψύαι,</foreign> and others call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλώπεκες,</foreign> and others <foreign xml:lang="grc">νευρόμητραι.</foreign>
                  </quote> And the admirable Hippocrates also speaks of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψύαι;</foreign> and they get this name from being easily wiped (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ ῥαδίως ἀποψᾶσθαι</foreign>), or as being flesh lightly
                  touching (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιψαύουσα</foreign>) the bones, and lying lightly
                  on the surface of them. And Euphron the comic poet mentions them in his Theori—

                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεώς; κάλος, κάλως.</foreign> And so, too, Epicharmus used
                  this noun, and Herodotus, and the author of the poem called the Helots. Moreover,
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγὸς</foreign> is the Ionic form— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, says that in the reign of
                  Antigonus Gonatas, there were such a number of hares in the island of Astypalæa,
                  that the natives consulted the oracle on the subject. And the Pythia answered them
                  that they ought to breed dogs, and hunt them; and so in one year there were caught
                  more than six thousand. And all this immense number arose from a man of the island
                  of Anaphe having put one pair of hares in the island. As also, on a previous
                  occasion, when a certain Astypalæan had let loose a pair of partridges in the
                  island of Anaphe, there came to be such a number of partridges in Anaphe, that the
                  inhabitants ran a risk of being driven out of the island by them. But originally
                  Astypalea had no hares at all, but only partridges. And the hare is a very
                  prolific animal as Xeno- phon has told us, in his treatise on Hunting; and
                  Herodotus <pb n="v.2.p.632"/> speaks of it in the following terms—<quote>Since
                     the hare is hunted by everything-man, beast, and bird—it is on this account a
                     very prolific animal; and it is the only animal known which is capable of
                     superfetation. And it has in its womb at one time one litter with the fur on,
                     and another bare, and another just formed, and a fourth only just
                     conceived.</quote> And Polybius, in the twelfth book of his History, says that.
                  there is another animal like the hare which is called the rabbit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κούνικλος</foreign>); and he writes as follows—<quote>The animal
                     called the rabbit, when seen at a distance, looks like a small hare; but when
                     any one takes it in his hands, there is a great difference between them, both
                     in appearance and taste: and it lives chiefly underground.</quote> And
                  Posidonius the philosopher also mentions them in his History; and we our selves
                  have seen a great many in our voyage from Dicæarchia<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The same as Puteoli.</note> to Naples. For there is an island
                  not far from the mainland, opposite the lower side of Dicæarchia, inhabited by
                  only a very scanty population, but having a great number of rabbits. And there is
                  also a kind of hare called the Chelidonian hare, which is mentioned by Diphilus,
                  or Calliades, in his play called Ignorance, in the following terms— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>What is this? whence this hare who bears the name</l>
                     <l>Of Chelidonian? Is it grey hare soup,</l>

                  that the Calydonian boar was a female, and that her meat was white. But he,
                  without giving the matter any long consideration, but rather turning the question

                  can find out by inquiry. But it is more correct and more consistent with etymology

                  of Cleomenes of Rhegium; and this account is given in that ode of them which is
                  entitled Meleager. And I am not ignorant that the inhabitants of Sicily call the
                  wild boar (which we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύαγρος</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσχέδωρος.</foreign> And Aeschylus, in his Phorcides, comparing
                  Perseus to a wild boar, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He rush'd into the cave like a wild boar (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσχέδωρος
                           ὥς</foreign>).</l>
                  </quote> And Sciras (and he is a poet of what is called the Italian comedy, and a
                  native of Tarentum), in his Meleager, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Where shepherds never choose to feed their flocks,</l>
                     <l>Nor does the wild boar range and chase his mate.</l>
                  </quote> And it is not wonderful that Aeschylus, who lived for some time in
                  Sicily, should use many Sicilian words.</p>

               <p>There were also very often kids brought round by the servants, dressed in various
                  ways; some of them with a great deal of assafoetida, which afforded us no ordinary
                  pleasure; for the flesh of the goat is exceedingly nutritious. At all events,
                  Chitomachus the Carthaginian, who is inferior to no one of the new Academy for his
                  spirit of philosophical investigation, says that a certain Theban athlete
                  surpassed all the men of his time in strength, because he ate goat's flesh; for
                  the juice of that meat is nervous and sticky, and such as can remain a long time
                  in the substance of the body. And this wrestler used to be much laughed at,
                  because of the unpleasant smell of his perspiration. And all the meat of pigs and
                  lambs, while it remains undigested in the system, is very apt to turn, because of
                  the fat. But the banquets spoken of by the comic poets rather please the ears by
                  sweet sounds, than the palate by sweet tastes; as, for instance, the feast
                  mentioned by Antiphanes, in his Female Physician— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>This single point—whom he has got to please</l>
                     <l>While seasoning his sauces properly;</l>
                     <l>And by this means he'll know the proper way</l>
                     <l>And time to lay his table and to dress</l>
                     <l>His meats and soups. But he who this neglects</l>
                     <l>Is not a cook, though he may be a seasoner.</l>
                     <l>But these are different arts, a wondrous space</l>
                     <l>Separates the two. It is not every one</l>
                     <l>That's called a general who commands an army,</l>
                     <l>But he who can with prompt and versatile skill</l>
                     <l>Avail himself of opportunities,</l>
                     <l>And look about him, changing quick his plans,</l>
                     <l>He is the general. He who can't do this</l>
                     <l>Is only in command. And so with us.</l>
                     <l>To roast some beef, to carve a joint with neatness,</l>
                     <l>To boil up sauces, and to blow the fire,</l>
                     <l>Is anybody's task; he who does this</l>
                     <l>Is but a seasoner and broth-maker:</l>
                     <l>A cook is quite another thing. His mind</l>
                     <l>Must comprehend all facts and circumstances:</l>
                     <l>Where is the place, and when the time of supper;</l>
                     <l>Who are the guests, and who the entertainer;</l>
                     <l>What fish he ought to buy, and when to buy it.</l>
                     <l>. . . . . For all these things</l>
                     <l>You'll have on almost every occasion;</l>
                     <l>But they're not always of the same importance,</l>

                     <l>Nor do they always the same pleasure give.</l>
                     <l>Archestratus has written on this art,</l>
                     <l>And is by many people highly thought of,</l>
                     <l>As having given us a useful treatise;</l>
                     <l>But still there's much of which he's ignorant,</l>

                     <l>Agathocles, I was the very first</l>
                     <l>To introduce the royal dish of lentils.</l>
                     <l>My chief exploit I have not mention'd yet:</l>
                     <l>There was a famine, and a man named Lachares</l>
                     <l>Was giving an entertainment to his friends;</l>
                     <l>Whom I recovered with some caper-sauce.</l>
                  </quote> Lachares made Minerva naked, who caused him no inconvenience; but I will
                  now strip you who are inconveniencing me, said Aemilianus, unless you show me what
                  you have got with you. And he said at last, rather unwillingly, I call this dish
                  the Dish of Roses. And it is prepared in such a way, that you may not only have
                  the ornament of a garland on your head, but also in yourself, and so feast your
                  whole body with a luxurious banquet. Having pounded a quantity of the most
                  fragrant roses in a mortar, I put in the brains of birds and pigs boiled and
                  thoroughly cleansed of all the sinews, and also the yolks of eggs, and with them
                  oil, and pickle-juice, and pepper, and wine. And having pounded all these things
                  carefully together, I put them into a new dish, applying a gentle and steady fire
                  to them. And while saying this, he uncovered the dish, and diffused such a sweet
                  perfume over the whole party, that one of the guests present said with great

               <p>After this, some roasted birds were brought round, and some lentils and peas,
                  saucepans and all, and other things of the same kind, concerning which Phænias the
                  Eresian writes thus, in his treatise on Plants—<quote>For every leguminous
                     cultivated plant bearing seed, is sown either for the sake of being boiled,
                     such as the bean and the pea, (for a sort of boiled soup is made of these
                     vegetables,) or else for the sake of extracting from them a farinaceous flour,
                     as, for instance, the aracus; or else to be cooked like lentils, as the aphace
                     and the common lentil; and some again are sown in order to serve as food for
                     fourfooted animals, as, for instance, the vetch for cattle, and the aphace for
                     sheep. But the vegetable called the pea is mentioned by Eupolis, in his Golden
                     Age. And Heliodorus, who wrote a description of the whole world, in the first
                     book of his treatise on the Acropolis, said—</quote> After the manner in <pb n="v.2.p.641"/> which to boil wheat was discovered, the ancients called it

               <p>Now, after this discussion had continued a long time, Democritus said—But at least
                  allow us to have a share of these lentils, or of the saucepan itself, lest some of
                  you get pelted with stones, like Hegemon the Thasian. And Ulpian said,—What is the
                  meaning of this pelting (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βαλλητὺς</foreign>) with stones?
                  for I know that in my native city, Eleusis, there is a festival celebrated which
                  is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαλλητὺς,</foreign> concerning which I will not
                  say a word, unless I get a reward from each of you. But I, said Democritus, as I
                  am not a person who makes speeches by the hour for hire, like the Prodeipnus of
                  Timon, will tell you all I know about Hegemon.</p>

               <p>Chamæleon of Pontus, in the sixth book of his treatise concerning ancient Comedy,

                     <l>Stood by my head, and touched me, and thus spake—</l>
                     <l>O thou ill-treated Lentil, wretched man,</l>
                     <l>Go to the contest: and I then took courage.</l>
                  </quote> And once he came into the theatre, exhibiting a comedy, having his robe
                  full of stones; and he, throwing the stones into the orchestra, caused the
                  spectators to wonder what he meant. And presently afterwards he said— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>These now are stones, and let who chooses throw them;</l>
                     <l>But Lentil's good alike at every season.</l>
                  </quote> But the man has an exceedingly high reputation for his parodies, and was
                  exceedingly celebrated for reciting his verses with great skill and dramatic
                  power; and on this account he was greatly admired by the Athenians. And in his
                  Battle of the Giants, he so greatly delighted the Athenians, that they laughed to
                  excess on that day; and though on that very day the news of all the disasters
                  which had befallen them in Sicily had just arrived, still no on left the theatre,
                  although nearly every one had lost relations by that calamity; and so they hid
                  their faces and wept, but no one rose to depart, in order to avoid being seen by
                  the spectators from other cities to be grieved at the disaster. But they remained
                  listening to the performance, and that too, though <pb n="v.2.p.642"/> Hegemon
                  himself, when he heard of it, had resolved to cease his recitation. But when the
                  Athenians, being masters of the sea, brought all the actions at law concerning the
                  islands or the islanders into the city, some one instituted a prosecution against
                  Hegemon, and summoned him to Athens to answer it. And he came in court, and
                  brought with him all the workmen of the theatre, and with them he appeared,
                  entreating Alcibiades to assist him. And Alcibiades bade him be of good cheer, and
                  ordered all the workmen to follow him; and so he came to the temple of Cybele,
                  where the trials of prosecutions were held; and then wetting his finger with his
                  mouth, he wiped out the indictment against Hegemon. And though the clerk of the
                  court and the magistrate were indignant at this, they kept quiet for fear of
                  Alcibiades, for which reason also the man who had instituted the prosecution ran

                  of his account of the Exploits of Hercules, calls him Eunomus. And Hercules also,
                  without intending it, killed Cyathus, the son of Pyles and brother of Antimachus,
                  who was acting as his cupbearer, as Nicander relates in the second book of his
                  History of Œta; to whom also he says that a temple was dedicated by Hercules in
                  the Proschium, which to this day is called the Temple of the Cupbearer.</p>
               <p>But we will stop this conversation at this point, and begin the next book with an
                  account of the voracity of Hercules.</p>

               <p>These, my good friend Timocrates, are the words of Astydamas the tragedian, in his
                  satyric drama of Hercules. Come, let us now proceed to mention what is consistent
                  with what we have said before, to show how great an eater Hercules was. And this
                  is a point in his character mentioned by nearly all poets and historians.
                  Epicharmus, in his Busiris, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For if you were to see him eat, you would</l>
                     <l>Be frighten'd e'en to death; his jaws do creak,</l>
                     <l>His throat with long deep-sounding thunder rolls,</l>
                     <l>His large teeth rattle, and his dog-teeth crash,</l>
                     <l>His nostrils hiss, his ears with hunger tremble.</l>
                  </quote> And Ion, in his Omphale, having mentioned his voracity, adds— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And then, excited by th' applause, he rose</l>
                     <l>And swallow'd all the logs and burning coals.</l>
                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.2.p.649"/> But Ion borrowed all this from Pindar, who said— * * * * *
                  And they say that he was a man of such excessive voracity, that they gave him the
                  cormorant, amongst birds which should be sacred to him, which is called the
                  ox-eater, on account of its voracity.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="2">
               <p>And Hercules is represented as having entered into a contest with Lepreus in
                  respect of their mutual powers of eating, Lepreus having been the challenger:
                  however, Hercules gained the victory. But Zenodotus, in the second book of his
                  Epitomes, says that Lepreus was the son of Caucon, who was the son of Neptune and
                  Astydamia; and that he ordered Hercules to be thrown into prison, when he demanded
                  of Augeas the reward which was due to him for his labours. But Hercules, when he
                  had completed his labours, came to the house of Caucon, and at the entreaty of
                  Astydamia, he became reconciled to Lepreus. And after this Lepreus contended with
                  Hercules in throwing the quoit, and in drawing water, and also as to which would
                  eat a bull with the greatest rapidity; and in all these things he was defeated.
                  And after that he armed himself, and challenged Hercules to single combat, and was
                  slain in the battle. But Matris, in his panegyric on Hercules, says, that Hercules
                  was also challenged by Lepreus to a contest as to who could drink most, and that
                  Lepreus was again defeated. And the Chian orator, Caucalus, the brother of
                  Theopompus the historian, relates the same story in his panegyric on Hercules.</p>

               <p>Homer, too, represents Ulysses as a great eater, and a very voracious man, when he

                     <l>Hunger is insolent and will be fed.</l>
                  </quote> For in these lines his gluttony appears prodigious, when it induces him
                  on so unseasonable an occasion to utter apophthegms about his stomach. For he
                  ought, if he had been ever so hungry, to have endured it, or at all events to have
                     <pb n="v.2.p.650"/> been moderate in his food. But this last passage shows the
                  extreme voracity and gluttony of the man— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For all my mind is overwhelm'd with care,</l>

                     <l>Still does my stomach bid me eat and drink,</l>
                     <l>Lest on my sorrows I too deeply think.</l>

                  </quote> For even the notorious Sardanapalus would hardly have ventured to give
                  utterance to such sentiments as those. Moreover, when Ulysses was an old man—

                  wine. And once at Olympia he took a four year old bull on his shoulders, and
                  carried it all round the course, and after that he killed it and cut it up, and
                  ate it all up by himself in one day. And Titormus the Aetolian had a contest with
                  him as to which could eat an ox with the greatest speed, as Alexander the Aetolian
                  relates. But Phylarchus, in the third book of his Histories, says that Milo, while
                  lying down before the altar of Jupiter, ate a bull, on which account Dorieus the
                  poet made the following epigram on him:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And by himself ate every bit of it.</l>

                  times in the pancratium, being once invited to supper by Ariobarzanes the Persian,
                  when he had come, offered to eat everything that had been prepared for the whole
                  party, and did eat it. And when, Theodorus relates, the Persian entreated him to
                  do something suitable to his enormous strength, he broke off a large brazen
                  ornament in the shape of a lentil from the couch and crushed it in his hand. And
                  when he died, and when his body was burnt, one urn would not contain his bones,
                  and scarcely two could do so. And they say that the dinner which he ate by himself
                  at Ariobarzanes's table had been prepared for nine persons.</p>

                  on only a lion's skin, and when playing on the trumpet he made a vast noise.
                  Accordingly, when Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, was besieging Argos, and when
                  his troops could not bring the helepolis against the walls on account of its
                  weight, he, giving the signal with his two trumpets at once, by the great volume
                  of so and which he poured forth, instigated the soldiers to move forward the
                  engine with great zeal and earnestness; and he gained the prize in all the games
                  ten times; and he used to eat sitting down, as Nestor tells us in his Theatrical
                  Reminisce aces. And there was a woman, too, who played on the trumpet, whose <pb n="v.2.p.654"/> name was Aglais, the daughter of Megacles, who, in the first
                  great procession which took place in Alexandria, played a processional piece of

                  accordingly, that he one night cut up his own wife into joints and ate her; and

                  vanquished a great many, one after another, taking them one by one, after this, he
                  beat the air with his hands; and when they asked him what he wanted, he said that

               <p>And Ariston the philosopher, in the second book of his Amatory Similitudes, says
                  that Polemo, the Academic philosopher, used to exhort those who were going to a
                  supper, to consider how they might make their party pleasant, not only for the
                  present evening, but also for the morrow. And Timotheus, the son of Conon, being
                  once taken by Plato from <pb n="v.2.p.661"/> a very sumptuous and princely
                  entertainment to one held at the Academy, and being there feasted in a simple and
                  scholar- like manner, said that those who supped with Plato would be well the next
                  day also. But Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that on the next day
                  Timotheus, meting with Plato, said, <quote>You, O Plato, sup well, more with
                     reference to the next day than to the present one!</quote> But Pyrrho the

                     expenses; for it is much better for us to delight one another by our mutual

               <p>But Antigonus of Carystus, in his Life of Menedemus, relating the way in which the
                  banquets of that philosopher are managed, says, that he used to dine with one or
                  two companions at most; and that all the rest of his guests used to come after
                  they had supped. For in fact, Menedemus's supper and dinner were only one meal,
                  and after that was over they called in all who chose to come; and if any of them,
                  as would be the case, came before the time, they would walk up and down before the
                  doors, and inquire of the servants who came out what was being now served up, and
                  how far on the dinner had proceeded. And if they heard that it was only the
                  vegetables or the cured fish that was being served up, they went away; but if they
                  were told that the meat was put on the table, then they went into the room which
                  had been prepared for that purpose. And in the summer a rush mat was spread over
                  each couch, and in the winter a fleece. But every one was expected to bring his
                  own pillow; and the cup, which was brought round to each person, did not hold more
                  than one cotyla. And the dessert was lupins or beans as a general rule; but
                  sometimes some fruits, such as ere in season, were brought in; in summer, pears or
                  pomegranates; and in spring, pulse; and in winter, figs. And we have a witness as
                  to these things, Lycophron the Chalcidian, who <pb n="v.2.p.662"/> wrote a
                  satyric drama entitled Menedemus, in which Silenus says to the satyrs— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  and his slave made him a sign that there were no loaves left, burst out laughing,
                  and clapped his hands; and said, <quote>What a feast we have here, my friends! We
                     forgot to buy loaves enough; run now, my boy:</quote> —and this he said,
                  laughing; and all the guests who were present burst out laughing, and great
                  amusement and entertainment were excited, so that the very want of bread was a
                  great seasoning to the feast. And at another time, Arcesilaus ordered Apelles, one
                  of his friends, to strain some wine; and when he, not being used to doing so,
                  shook some of the wine and spilt some, so that the wine appeared much thicker than
                  usual, he laughed, and said, <quote>But I told a man to strain the wine who has
                     never seen anything good any more than I myself have; so do you now get up,
                     Aridices; and do you go away and tap the casks that are outside.</quote> And

                  </quote> does not mean that there is to be less water, but that the draught is to
                  be hot; urging that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζωρὸς</foreign> is derived from <pb n="v.2.p.668"/>
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζωτικὸς</foreign> (giving life), and from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζέσις</foreign> (boiling);—for that, as there were companions
                  present, it would have been absurd to begin mixing the cups of wine over again.
                  But some say that the word is to be understood as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔκρατον</foreign> (well-mixed); just as we find the form <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεξιτερὸν</foreign> used instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεξιόν.</foreign> And some say that, since the year is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧρος,</foreign> and since the particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζα</foreign> indicates magnitude or number, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζῶρος</foreign> means merely what has been made many years.

                  </quote> And Euripides the poet, when he was a boy, acted s cupbearer.
                  Accordingly, Theophrastus, in his treatise on Drinking, says—<quote>But I hear
                     that Euripides the poet also acted as a cupbearer at Athens, among those who
                     are called the dancers.: and these men were they who used to dance around the
                     temple of the Delian Apollo, being some of the noblest of the Athenians, and
                     they were clothed in garments <pb n="v.2.p.670"/> of the Theræans. And this is
                     that Apollo in whose honour they celebrate the Thargelian festival; and a

                  Hieronymus the Rhodian gives the same account, who was a disciple of Aristotle,
                  and that too in a book of his entitled a Treatise on Drunkenness. And the
                  beautiful Sappho often praises her brother Larichus, as having acted as cupbearer
                  to the Mitylenæans in the Prytaneum. And among the Romans, the most nobly born of
                  the youths perform this office in the public sacrifices, imitating the Aeolians in
                  everything, as even in the tones of their voices.</p>

               <p>And so great was the luxury of the ancients in respect of their sumptuous meals,
                  that they not only had cupbearers, but also men whom they called œnoptæ
                  (inspectors of wines). At all events, the office of œnoptæ is a regular office
                  among the Athenians; and it is mentioned by Eupolis, in his play called The
                  Cities, in the following lines— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And men whom heretofore you'd not have thought</l>

                     <l>How much your fortune does outrun your sense.</l>
                  </quote> And these œnoptæ superintended the arrangement of banquets, taking care
                  that the guests should drink on equal terms. But it was an office of no great
                  dignity, as Philinus the orator tells us, in his debate on the Croconidæ. And he
                  tells us, too, that the œnoptæ were three in number, and that they also provided
                  the guests with lamps and wicks. And some. people called them <quote>eyes;</quote>
                  but among the Ephesians, the youths who acted as cupbearers at the festival of
                  Neptune were called <quote>bulls,</quote> as Amerias tells us. And the people of
                  the Hellespont call the cupbearer <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεγχύτης,</foreign> or
                  the pourer out; and they call carving, which we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεωνομία,</foreign>
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεωδαισία,</foreign> as Demetrius of Scepsis tells us, in
                  the twenty-sixth book of his Arrangement of the Trojan Forces. And some say that
                  the nymph Harmonia acted as cupbearer to the gods; as Capito the epic poet relates
                  (and he was a native of Alexandria by birth), in the second book of his Love
                  Poems. But Alcæus also represents Mercury as their cupbearer; as also does Sappho,

                  people have represented Hebe as acting as cupbearer to the gods, perhaps because
                  their banquets were called Hebeteria. And Ptolemy, the son of Agesarchus, speaks
                  of a damsel named Cleino as the cupbearer of Ptolemy the king, who was surnamed
                  Philadelphus, mentioning her in the third book of his History of Philopator. But
                  Polybius, in the fourteenth book of his History, adds that there are statues of

                  or one of wine to three of water. But, concerning this mixture, Ion the poet, in
                  his book on Chios, says that Palamedes the soothsayer discovered and prophesied to
                  the Greeks, that they would have a favourable voyage if they drank one portion of
                  wine to three of water. But they, applying themselves to their drink very
                  vigorously, took two pints of wine to five of water;—accordingly Nicochares in his
                  Amymone, playing on the name, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  men practised throwing the cottabus with great care, it being originally a

                     drinking-parties of young men in Athens. The simplest mode was when each threw
                     the wine left in his cup so as to strike smartly in a metal basin, at the same
                     time invoking his mistress's name. If all fell in the basin, and the sound was
                     clear, it was a sign that he stood well with her. The basin was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτταβεῖον,</foreign> the action of throwing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκοτταβίζειν,</foreign> and the wine thrown <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάταγες,</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαταγή.</foreign>
                     The game afterwards became more complicated, and was played in various ways;
                     sometimes a number of little cups (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξύβαφα</foreign>)
                     were set floating, and he who threw his cottabus so as to upset the greatest
                     number, in a given number of throws, won the prize, which was also called
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτταβεῖον.</foreign> Sometimes the wine was thrown
                     upon a scale (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλάστιξ</foreign>), suspended over a little
                     image (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μάνης</foreign>) placed in water: here the
                     cottabus was to be thrown so as to make the scale descend upon the head of the

               <p>But those men do not act wisely who represent and describe Bacchus in their
                  statues or pictures, and who also lead him through the middle of the market-place
                  on a waggon, as if he were drunk; for, by so doing, they show the beholders that
                  wine is stronger than the god. And I do not think that even a good and wise man
                  could stand this. And if they have represented him in this state because he first
                  showed us the use of wine, it is plain that for the same reason they should always
                  represent Ceres as reaping corn or eating bread. And I should say that Aeschylus
                  himself erred in this particular; for he was the first person (and not Euripides,
                  as some people say,) who introduced the appearance of drunken people into a
                  tragedy. For in his Cabiri he introduces Jason drunk. But the fact is, that the
                  practices which the tragedian himself used to indulge in, he attributed to his
                  heroes: at all events he used to write his tragedies when he was drunk; on which
                  account Sophocles used to reproach him, and say to him, <quote>O Aeschylus,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Schlegel gives a very different
                        interpretation to this story. He says—<quote>In Aeschylus the tragic style
                           is as yet imperfect, and not unfrequently runs into either unmixed epic
                           or lyric. It is often abrupt, irregular, and harsh. To compose more
                           regular and skilful tragedies than those of Aeschylus was by no means
                           difficult; but in the more than mortal grandeur which he displayed, it
                           was impossible that he should ever be surpassed, and even Sophocles, his
                           younger and more fortunate rival, did not in this respect equal him. The
                           latter, in speaking of Aeschylus, gave a proof that he was himself a
                           thoughtful artist;— Aeschylus does what is right, without knowing it.'

                  gallantry in war when they were drunk. But among the Epizephyrian Locrians, if any
                  one drank untempered wine, except by the express command of his physician for the
                  sake of his health, he was liable to be punished with death, in accordance with a
                  law to that effect passed by Zalericus.</p>
               <p>And among the people of Massilia there was a law that the women should drink water
                  only. And Theophrastus says, that to this day that is the law at Miletus. And
                  among the Romans no slave ever drank wine, nor any free woman, nor any youth born
                  of free parents till he was thirty years of age. And Anacreon is very ridiculous
                  for having referred all his poems to the subject of drunkenness; for, owing to
                  this, he is found fault with as having in his poems wholly abandoned himself to
                  effeminacy and luxury, as the multitude are not aware that while he wrote he was a
                  sober and virtuous man, who pretended to be a drunkard, when there was no
                  necessity at all for his doing so.</p>

               <p>And men who are ignorant of the power of wine, say that Bacchus is the cause of
                  madness to men; in saying which they abuse wine in a very senseless manner. On
                  which account Melanippides says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>All men have detested water</l>
                     <l>Who did not before have wine;</l>
                     <l>And though some have enjoy'd their cups,</l>
                     <l>Others have turn'd to ravings wild.</l>
                  </quote> And Aristotle, in his treatise on Drinking, says, <quote>If the wine be
                     moderately boiled, then when it is drunk, it is less pt to intoxicate; for, as
                     some of its power has been boiled away, it has become weaker.</quote> And he
                  also says, "Old men become drunk more quickly on account of the small quantity of
                  natural warmth which there is in them, and also of the weak <pb n="v.2.p.678"/>
                  ness of what there is. And again, those who are very young get drunk very quickly,
                  on account of the great quantity of natural warmth that there is in them; for, in
                  consequence, they are easily subdued by the warmth proceeding from the wine which
                  is added to their natural warmth. And some of the brute beasts are also capable of
                  becoming intoxicated; such as pigs when they are filled with the husks of pressed
                  grapes; and the whole race of crows, and of dogs, when they have eaten of the herb
                  called cenussa: and the monkey and the elephant get intoxicated if they drink
                  wine; on which account they hunt monkeys and crows when the former have been made
                  drunk with wine, and the latter with œnussa. <quote rend="blockquote">

                  any of these statements let him come forward: and then he shall be told, as Evenus
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>That may be your opinion; this is mine.</l>
                  </quote> But I, since I have now made this digression about the mix- tures of the
                  ancients, will resume the thread of my original discourse where I let it drop;
                  considering what was said by Alcæus the lyric poet. For he speaks, somewhere or
                  other, in this way— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Pour out, in just proportion, one and two.</l>
                  </quote> For in these words some people do not think that he is alluding to the
                  mixture of wine and water at all; but that, being a moderate and temperate man, he
                  would not drink <pb n="v.2.p.679"/> more than one cyathus of pure wine, or
                  perhaps, at the most, two. And this is the interpretation given to the passage by
                  Chameleon of Pontus, who was ignorant how fond of wine Alcæus had been. For this
                  poet will be found to have been in the habit of drinking at every season and in
                  every imaginable condition of affairs. In winter he speaks thus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Now the storm begins to lower,</l>
                     <l>And Jove descends in heavy snow,</l>
                     <l>And streams of water stand congeal'd</l>
                     <l>In cruel ice: let's drive away</l>
                     <l>The wintry cold, and heap up fire,</l>
                     <l>And mingle with unsparing hand</l>
                     <l>The honied cup, and wreathe our brows</l>
                     <l>With fragrant garlands of the season.</l>
                  </quote> And in summer, he writes— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Now it behoves a man to soak his lungs</l>
                     <l>In most cool wine; for the fierce dogstar rages,</l>
                     <l>And all things thirst with the excessive heat.</l>
                  </quote> And in spring he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And shed its gifts all o'er the land;</l>
                  </quote> and he continues— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>A cup of luscious Lesbian wine.</l>
                  </quote> And in his misfortunes he sings— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Us wine and joyous drunkenness.</l>
                  </quote> And in his hours of joy he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Now is the time to get well drunk,</l>
                     <l>Now e'en in spite of self to drink,</l>
                     <l>Since Myrsilus is dead at last.</l>
                  </quote> And, giving some general advice, he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>How, then, could a man who was so very devoted to drinking be a sober man, and be
                  content with one or two cups of wine? At all events, his very poem, says Seleucus,
                  testifies against those people who receive the line in this sense. For he says, in
                  the whole passage— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Let us now drink,—why put we out the light?</l>

                  </quote> In which words he plainly enough intimates that his meaning is, that one

            <div type="chapter" n="36">

                  <quote>But to drink to the degree of drunkenness,</quote> says Plato, in his sixth
                  book of the Laws, is neither becoming any- Where—except perhaps in the days of
                  festival of the god who gave men wine for their banquets,—nor is it wholesome:
                  and, above all, a man ought to guard against such a thing who has any thoughts of
                  marriage; for at such a time, above all other times, both bride and bridegroom
                  ought to be in full possession of their faculties; when they are entering upon
                  what is no small change in the circumstances of their life; and also they ought to
                  be influenced by anxiety that their offspring shall be the offspring of parents in
                  the fullest possible possession of all their faculties; for it is very uncertain
                  what day or what night will be the originating cause of it. <quote>And in the
                     first book of his Laws he says—</quote> But respecting drunkenness it may be a
                  question, whether we ought to give way to it as the Lydians do, and the Persians,
                  and the Carthaginians, and the Celtæ, and the Spaniards, and the Thracians, and
                  other nations like them; or whether like you, O Lacedæmonians, one ought wholly to
                  abstain from it. But the Scythians and the Thracians, who indulge altogether in
                  drinking unmixed wine, both the women and all the men, and who spill it all over
                  their clothes, think that they are maintaining a very honourable practice, and one
                  that tends to their happiness. And the Persians indulge to a great extent in other
                  modes of luxury which you reject; but still they practise them with more
                  moderation than the Scythians and Thracians.</p>

               <p>And a great many of the guests were drinking, and putting lumps of meal into their
                  wine, a custom which Hegesander of Delphi mentions. Accordingly Epinicus, when
                  Mnesiptolemus had given a recitation of his history, in which it was written how
                  Seleucus had used meal in his <pb n="v.2.p.683"/> wine, having written a drama
                  entitled Mnesiptolemus, and having turned him into ridicule, as the comic poets
                  do, and using his own words about that sort of drink, represents him as saying:—

                  lentils and pease into meal, instead of ordinary corn, and put that into the wine,
                  and that this drink is said to be better than that in which the meal is mixed.</p>

                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοκωθωνιστὴς</foreign> who drinks to the degree of
                  drunkenness. And of all heroes, the greatest drinker is Nestor, who lived three
                  times as long as other men; for he evidently used to stick to his wine more
                  closely than other people, and even than Agamemnon himself, whom Achilles upbraids
                  as a man given to much drinking. But Nestor, even when a most important battle was
                  impending, could not keep away from drinking. Accordingly Homer says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But not the genial feast or flowing bowl</l>
                     <l>Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul.</l>
                  </quote> And he is the only hero whose drinking-cup he has described, as he has
                  the shield of Achilles; for he went to the war with his goblet just as he did with
                  that shield, the fame of which Hector says had reached to heaven. And a man would
                  not be very wrong who called that cup of his the Goblet of Mars, like the Cæneus
                  of Antiphanes, in which it is said— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The hero stood and brandish'd Mars's cup,</l>
                     <l>Like great Timotheus, and his polish'd spear.</l>
                  </quote> And indeed it was on account of his fondness for drinking that Nestor, in
                  the games instituted in honour of Patroclus, received a drinking-cup as a present
                  from Achilles; not but what Achilles also gave a cup to the competitor who was
                  defeated: for victory does not commonly attend hard drinkers, on account of their
                  usual inactivity; or perhaps it is owing to their thirst that boxers usually fail,
                  from being <pb n="v.2.p.685"/> fatigued with holding out their hands too long.

               <p>Proteas the Macedonian was also a very great drinker, as Ephippus tells us in his
                  treatise on the Funeral of Alexander and Hephæstion: and he had an admirable
                  constitution, and he had practised drinking to a great degree. Accordingly,
                  Alexander, having once asked for a cup containing two choes, and having drank from
                  it, pledged Proteas; and he, having taken it, and having sung the praises of the
                  king a great deal, drank it in such a manner as to be applauded by every one. And
                  presently Proteas asked for the same cup again, and again he drank and pledged the
                  king. And Alexander, having taken the cup, drank it off in a princely manner, but
                  he could not stand it, but leaned back on the <pb n="v.2.p.686"/> pillow, letting

                     receiving a similar pledge from all of them, and then, rising up from the

                  king to get drunk; but among the Persians it is permitted to the king to get drunk
                  one day in the year,—the day, namely, on which they sacrifice to Mithras. And
                  Duris writes thus, with respect to this circumstance, in the seventh book of his
                  Histories:—"The king gets drunk and dances the Persian dance on that festival only
                  which is celebrated by the Persians in honour of Mithras; but no one else does so
                  in all Asia; but all abstain during this day from dancing at all. For the Persians
                  learn to dance as they learn to ride; and they think that the motion originated by
                  this sort of exercise contains in it a good kind of practice tending to the
                  strength of the body. <pb n="v.2.p.687"/> But Alexander used to get so drunk, as
                  Carystius of Pergamus relates in his Historic Commentaries, that he used even to
                  celebrate banquets in a chariot drawn by asses; and the Persian kings too, says
                  he, did the same thing. And perhaps it was owing to this that he had so little
                  inclination for amatory pleasures; for Aristotle, in his Problems of Natural
                  History, says, that the powers of men who drink to any great excess are much
                  weakened. And Hieronymus, in his Letters, says, that Theophrastus says, that
                  Alexander was not much of a man for women; and accordingly, when Olympias had
                  given him Callixene, a Thessalian courtesan, for a mistress, who was a most
                  beautiful woman, (and all this was done with the consent of Philip, for they were
                  afraid that he was quite impotent,) she was constantly obliged to ask him herself

               <p>And Philip, the father of Alexander, was a man very fond of drinking, as
                  Theopompus relates in the twenty-sixth book of his History. And in another part of
                  his History he writes, <quote>Philip was a man of violent temper and fond of
                     courting dangers, partly by nature, and partly too from drinking; for he was a
                     very hard drinker, and very often he would attack the enemy while he was
                     drunk.</quote> And in his fifty-third book, speaking of the things that took
                  place at Chæronea, and relating how he invited to supper the ambassadors of the
                  Athenians who were present there, he says, "But Philip, when they had gone away,
                  immediately sent for some of his companions, and bade the slaves summon the female
                  flute-players, and Aristonicus the harp-player, and Durion the flute-player, and
                  all the rest who were accustomed to drink with him; for Philip always took people
                  of that sort about with him, and he had also invented for himself many instruments
                  for banquets and drinking parties; for being very fond of drinking and a man
                  intemperate in his manners, he used to keep a good many buffoons an musicians and
                  professed jesters about him. And when he had spent the whole night in drinking,
                  and had got very drunk and violent, he then dismissed all the rest, and when it
                  was day-break proceeded in a riotous manner to the ambssadors of the Athenians.
                  And Carystius in his Historical Commentaries says, that Philip, when he intended
                  to get drunk, spoke in this way: <quote>Now we may drink; for it is quite
                     sufficient if Antipater is sober.</quote> And once, when he was playing <pb n="v.2.p.688"/> at dice, and some one told him that Antipater was coming, he
                  hesitated a moment, and then thrust the board under the couch.</p>

               <p>And Theopompus gives a regular catalogue of men fond of drinking and addicted to
                  drunkenness; and among them he mentions the younger Dionysius, the tyrant of
                  Sicily, whose eyes were a good deal injured by wine. And Aristotle, in his Polity
                  of the Syracusans, says that he sometimes was drunk for three months at a time
                  together, owing to which he had got somewhat weak in the eyes. And Theophrastus
                  says that his companions also, who were flatterers of the supreme power, pretended
                  not to see well, and to be led by the hand by Dionysius, and not to be able to see
                  the meat that was served up before them, nor the cups of wine, on which account
                  they got the name of Dionysiocolaces, or flatterers of Dionysius Nysæus also, who
                  was tyrant of Syracuse, drank a great deal, and so did Apollocrates; and these men
                  were the sons of the former Dionysius, as Theopompus tells us in the fortieth and
                  forty-first books of his History; and he writes thus about Nysæus: <quote>Nysæus,
                     who was afterwards tyrant of Syracuse, when he was taken for the purpose of
                     being put to death, and knew that he had only a few months to live, spent them
                     wholly in eating and drinking.</quote> And in his thirty-ninth book he says:
                     <quote>Apollocrates, the son of Dionysius the tyrant, was an intemperate man,
                     and addicted to drinking; and some of his flatterers worked upon him so as to
                     alienate him as much as possible from his father.</quote> And he says that
                  Hipparinus, the son of Dionysius, who behaved like a tyrant when drunk, was put to
                  death. And about Nyssus he writes as follows: <quote>Nysæus, the son of the elder
                     Dionysius, having made himself master of Syracuse, got a four-horse chariot,
                     and put on an embroidered robe, and devoted himself to gluttony and hard
                     drinking, and to insulting boys and ravishing women, and to all other acts
                     which are consistent with such conduct. And he passed his life in this
                     manner.</quote> And in his forty-fifth book the same historian, speaking of
                  Timolaus the Theban, says: <quote>For though there have been a great many men who
                     have been intemperate in their daily life, and in their drinking, I do not
                     believe that there has ever been any one who was concerned in state affairs,
                     more intemperate, or a greater glutton, or a more complete slave to his
                     pleasures than Timolaus, whom I <pb n="v.2.p.689"/> have mentioned.</quote>
                  And in his twenty-third book, speaking of Charidemus of Oreum, whom the Athenians
                  made a citizen, he says: <quote>For it was notorious that he spent every day in
                     the greatest intemperance, and in such a manner that he was always drinking and
                     getting drunk, and endeavoring to seduce free-born women; and he carried his
                     intemperance to such a height that he ventured to beg a young boy, who was very
                     beautiful and elegant, from the senate of the Olynthians, who had happened to
                     be taken prisoner in the company of Derdas the Macedonian.</quote>

               <p>A man of the name of Arcadion, too, was a very great drinker, (but it is uncertain
                  whether this is the same man who was at enmity with Philip,) as the epigram shows
                  which Polemo has preserved in his treatise on the Inscriptions existing in
                  different Cities— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And the inscription over some man of the name of Erasixenus says that he
                  also drank a great deal. <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Twice was this cup, full of the strongest wine,</l>

                     <l>And then in turn it carried him away.</l>
                  </quote> Alcetas the Macedonian also used to drink a great deal, as Aristos the
                  Salaminian relates; and so did Diotimus the Athenian: and he was the man who was
                  surnamed the Funnel. For he put a funnel into his mouth, and would then drink
                  without ceasing while the wine was being poured into it, according to the account
                  of Polemo. And it has been already mentioned that Cleomenes the Lacedæmonian was a
                  great drinker of unmixed wine; and that in consequence of his drunkenness he cut
                  himself to pieces with a sword, is related by Herodotus. And Alcæus the poet also
                  was very fond of drinking, as I have already mentioned. And Baton of Sinope, in
                  his essay on Ion the poet, says that Ion was a man fond of drinking and amorous to
                  excess; and he himself, too, in his Elegies, confesses that he loved Chrysilla the
                  Corinthian, the daughter of Teleas, with whom Teleclides, in his Hesiods, says
                  that the Olympian<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">This was a name given to

               <p>And Chares the Mitylenæan, in his History of Alexander, speaking of Calanus the
                  Indian philosopher, and saying that he threw himself on a funeral pile that had
                  been raised, and so died, says also that Alexander instituted some gymnastic games
                  at his tomb, and also a musical contest of panegyrics on him.—<quote>And he
                     instituted,</quote> says Chares, <quote>because of the great fondness of the
                     Indians for wine, a contest as to who should drink the greatest quantity of
                     unmixed wine; and the prize was a talent for the first, and thirty mince for
                     the second, and ten mince for the third. And of those who entered for the prize
                     and drank the wine, thirty-five died at once by reason of the cold; and a
                     little afterwards six more died in their tents. And he who drank the greatest
                     quantity and won the prize, drank four choes of unmixed wine, and received the
                     talent; and he lived four days after it; and he was called the
                     Champion.</quote> And Timæus says that <quote>Dionysius the tyrant gave, at the
                     festival of the Choes, to the first man who should drink a choeus, a golden
                     crown as a prize:</quote> and he says also that <quote>Xenocrates the
                     philosopher was the first person who drank it; and that he, taking the golden
                     crown, and departing, offered it up to the Mercury who was placed in his
                     vestibule, on which statue he was always accustomed on every occasion to offer
                     up the garlands of flowers which he had, every evening as he returned home; and
                     he was much admired for this conduct.</quote> And Phanodemus says, that the
                  festival of the Choes was established at Athens by Demophoon the king, when he was
                  desirous to receive Orestes in hospitality on his arrival at Athens. And that, as
                  he did not like him to come to the temples, or to share in the libations offered
                  to the gods, before his trial was decided, he ordered all the temples to be shut,
                  and a choeus of wine to be set before everybody, saying that a cheesecake should
                  be given as a prize to the first person who drank it up. And he bade them, when
                  they had finished drinking, not to offer up the garlands, with which they had been
                  crowned, in the temples, because they had been under the same roof with Orestes;
                  but he desired each man to place his garland round his own cup, and so to bring
                  them to the priestess at the temple which is in the Marshes, and <pb n="v.2.p.691"/> after that to perform the rest of the sacred ceremonies in the
                  temple. And from thence it was that this festival got the name of the Choes. But
                  on the day of the festival of the Choes, it is customary for the Athenians to send
                  presents and pay to the sophists, who also themselves invite their acquaintances
                  to a banquet, as Eubulides the dialectician shows us in his drama entitled the
                  Revellers, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You're acting like a sophist now, you wretch,</l>

               <p>But Antigonus the Carystian, in his essay on the Life of Dionysius of Heraclea,
                  who was called the Turncoat, says that Dionysius, when he was feasting with his
                  slaves at the festival of the Choes, and was not able, by reason of his old age,
                  to avail himself of the courtesan whom they brought him, turned round and said to
                  those who were feasting with him— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I cannot now, so let another take her.</l>
                  </quote> But Dionysius, as Nicias of Nicæa tells us in his Successions, had been
                  from the time he was a boy very furious in the indulgence of his amorous
                  propensities; and he used to go to all the common women promiscuously. And once,
                  when walking with some of his acquaintances, when he came near the house where the
                  girls are kept, and where, having been there the day before, he had left some
                  money owing, as he happened to have some with him then, he put out his hand and
                  paid it in the presence of all of them. And Anacharsis the Scythian, when a prize
                  for drinking was proposed at the table of Periander, demanded the prize, because
                  he was the first man to be drunk of all the guests who were present; as if to get
                  to the end were the goal to be aimed at and the victory to be achieved in drinking
                  as in running a race. But Lacydes and Timon the philosophers, being invited to an
                  entertainment which was to last two days, by one of their friends, and wishing to
                  adapt themselves to the rest of the guests, drank with great eagerness. And
                  accordingly, in the first day, Lacydes went away first, as soon as he was quite
                  satiated with drink. And Timon, seeing him as he was departing, said— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Now have we gain'd immortal praise and fame,</l>
                     <l>Since we have slain great Hector.</l>
                  </quote> But on the next day Timon went away first because he could <pb n="v.2.p.692"/> not drink up the goblet in which he had been pledged, and
                  Lacydes seeing him departing, said— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And Herodotus, in his second book, relates that Myce- rinus the Egyptian, having
                  been told by the soothsayers that he was fated to live but a short time, used to
                  light a great number of lamps when night arrived, and spend all his time in
                  drinking and luxury, relaxing neither by day nor by night; and when he withdrew
                  into the marshes and into the groves, or wherever he heard that there were
                  meetings of young people to amuse themselves, he always got drunk. And Herodotus
                  tells us that Amasis also, who was another of the Egyptian kings, was a very hard
                  drinker indeed. And Hermeas the Methymnæan, in the third book of his History of
                  Sicily, says that Nicoteles the Corinthian was a man greatly addicted to drinking.
                  And Phænias the Eresian, in the book entitled, The Slaying of Tyrants out of
                  Revenge, says that Scopas the son of Creon, and the grandson of the former Scopas,
                  was throughout his whole life very fond of drinking; and that he used to return
                  from banquets at which he had been present, sitting on a throne, and carried by
                  four palanquin-bearers, and in that way he used to enter his house. And
                  Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories, says that Antiochus the king was a
                  man very fond of wine; and that he used to get drunk, and then go to sleep for a
                  long time, and then, as evening came on, he would wake up, and drink again. And it
                  was very seldom, says he, that he transacted the affairs of his kingdom when he
                  was sober, but much more frequently when he was drunk; on which account there were
                  two men about him who managed all the real business of the state as they pleased,
                  namely Aristos and Themiso, Cyprians by birth, and brothers; and they were both on
                  terms of the greatest intimacy with Antiochus.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="52">
               <p>And Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Epiphanes, was also a great drinker,—the
                  one, I mean, who had been a hostage among the Romans, whom Ptolemy Euergetes
                  mentions in the third book of his Commentaries, and also in the fifth; saying that
                  he turned to Indian revellings and drunkenness, and spent a vast quantity of money
                  in those practices; and for the rest of the money which he had at hand, he spent
                     <pb n="v.2.p.693"/> a part of it in his daily revels, and the rest he would
                  scatter about, standing in the public streets, and saying, <quote>Let whoever
                     chance gives it to, take it:</quote> and then, throwing the money about, he
                  would depart. And very often, having a plaited garland of roses on his head, and
                  wearing a golden embroidered robe, he would walk about alone, having stones under
                  his arm, which he would throw at those of his friends who were following him. And
                  he used to bathe also in the public baths, anointed all over with perfumes; and,
                  on one occasion, some private individual, seeing him, said, <quote>You are a happy
                     man, O king; you smell in a most costly manner:</quote> and he, being much
                  pleased, said, <quote>I will give you as much as you can desire of this
                     perfume.</quote> And so he ordered an ewer containing more than two choes of
                  thick perfumed unguent to be poured over his head; so that the multitude of the
                  poorer people who were about all collected to gather up what was spilt; and, as
                  the place was made very slippery by it, Antiochus himself slipped and fell,
                  laughing a great deal, and most of the bathers did the same.</p>
               <p>But Polybius, in the twenty-sixth book of his Histories, calls this man Epimanes
                  (mad), and not Epiphanes (illustrious), on account of his actions. <quote>For he
                     not only used to go to entertainments of the common citizens, but he also would
                     drink with any strangers who happened to be sojourning in the city, and even
                     with those of the meanest class. And if,</quote> says Polybius, <quote>he heard
                     that any of the younger men were making a feast anywhere whatever, he would
                     come with an earthen bowl, and with music, so that the greater part of the

                     would put off his royal robes, and take a common cloak, and in that dress go

               <p>And in the thirty-first book of his Histories, the same Polybius tells us
                     <quote>that when Antiochus was celebrating some public games at Antioch, he
                     invited all the Greeks and any of the multitude who chose to come to the
                     spectacle. And when a great many people came, he anointed them all in the
                     gymnasia with ointment of saffron, and cinnamon, and nard, and amaracus, and
                     lilies, out of golden vessels: and then, inviting them all to a feast, he
                     filled sometimes a thousand and sometimes fifteen hundred triclinia with the
                     most <pb n="v.2.p.694"/> expensive preparations; and he himself personally
                     attended to waiting on the guests. For, standing at the entrance, he introduced
                     some, and others he placed upon the couches; and he himself marshalled the
                     servants who brought in the different courses; and, walking about among the
                     guests, at times he sat down in one place, and at times he lay down in another.
                     And sometimes he would put down what he was eating, and at other times he would
                     lay down his cup, and jump up, and change his place, and go all round the
                     party, standing up himself, and pledging different people at different times;
                     and then, mingling with the musicians, he would be brought in by the actors,
                     entirely covered up, and laid down on the ground, as if he had been one of the
                     actors himself; and then, when the music gave the signal, the king would leap
                     up, and dance and sport among the actors, so that they were all ashamed. To
                     such absurdities does a want of education, when joined with drunkenness, reduce
                     miserable men.</quote> And his namesake, the Antiochus who carried on war in
                  Media against Arsaces, was very fond of drinking; as Posidonius of Apamea relates
                  in the sixteenth book of his History. Accordingly, when he was slain, he says that
                  Arsaces, when he buried him, said—Your courage and your drunkenness have ruined
                  you, O Antiochus; for you hoped that, in your great cups, you would be able to
                  drink up the kingdom of Arsaces."</p>

               <p>But the Antiochus who was surnamed the Great, who was subdued by the Romans (as
                  Polybius relates in his twentieth book), having arrived at Chalcis, in Euboea,
                  celebrated a marriage when he was fifty years of age; and after he had undertaken
                  two most enormous and important affairs, namely, the liberation of the Greeks (as
                  he himself professed) and the war against the Romans. At all events, he, being
                  smitten with love for a damsel of Chalcis, was very anxious to marry her at the
                  very time that he was engaged in this war, being a man very fond of drinking and
                  delighting in drunkenness. And she was the daughter of Cleophanes, one of the
                  nobles, and superior to all the maidens of her country in beauty. Accordingly, he
                  celebrated his marriage in Chalcis, and remained there all the winter, not once
                  giving the smallest thought to the important affairs which he had in hand. And he
                  gave the damsel the name of Eubœa. Accordingly, being defeated <pb n="v.2.p.695"/> in the war, he fled to Ephesus, with his newly-married bride. And in the second
                  book, the same Polybius relates that Agron, the king of the Illyrians, being
                  delighted at having gained a victory over the haughty Aetolians, being a man much
                  addicted to drinking, and to drunkenness, and banqueting, fell ill of a pleurisy,
                  and died. And the same historian says, in his twenty-ninth book, that Genthion,
                  the king of the Illyrians, on account of his great fondness for drinking, did a
                  great many intemperate things during his life, being incessantly drunk, both night
                  and day; and having murdered Pleuratus, his brother, who was about to marry the
                  daughter of Menunius, he married the damsel himself, and treated his subjects with
                  great cruelty. And he says, in the thirty-third book of his History, that
                  Demetrius, when he fled after having been a hostage at Rome, and became king of
                  the Syrians, became a great drinker, and was drunk the greater part of the day.
                  And he also, in his thirty-second book, says that Orophernes, who was for a short
                  time king of Cappadocia, disregarded all the customs of his country, and
                  introduced the artificial luxury of the Ionians.</p>

               <p>On which account, that divinest of writers, Plato, lays down admirable laws in his
                  second book—<quote>That boys, till they are eighteen years of age, should
                     absolutely never taste wine at all; for that it is not well to heap fire on
                     fire: that men up to thirty years of age may drink wine in moderation; and that
                     the young man should wholly abstain from much wine and from drunkenness. But
                     that a man, when he arrives at forty years of age, may feast in large banquets,
                     and invoke the other gods, and especially Bacchus, to the feasts and amusements
                     of the older men; since he it is who has given men this means of indulgence, as
                     an ally against the austerity of old age, for which wine was the best medicine;
                     so that, owing to it, we grow young again, and forget our moroseness.</quote>
                  And then he proceeds to say—<quote>But there is a report and story told that this
                     god was once deprived of his mind and senses by his mother-in-law, Juno; on
                     which account he sent Bacchic frenzy, and all sorts of frantic rage, among men,
                     out of revenge for the treatment which he had experienced; on which account
                     also he gave wine to men.</quote>

               <p>But Phalæcus, in his Epigrams, makes mention of a woman, whose name was Cleo, as

                  </quote> And it is a well-known fact that all the race of women is fond of
                  drinking. And it was not without some wit that Xenarchus introduces, in his
                  Pentathlum, a woman swearing this most horrible oath:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>May it be granted me to pass from life</l>
                     <l>Drinking abundant draughts of wine, while you,</l>
                     <l>My darling daughter, live and prosper here.</l>
                  </quote> But among the Romans, as Polybius says, in his sixth book, it was
                  forbidden to women to drink wine at all. However, they drink what is called
                  Passum; and that is made of raisins, and when drank is very like the sweet
                  Aegosthenite and Cretan wine, on which account men use it when oppressed by
                  excessive thirst. And it is impossible for a woman to drink wine without being
                  detected: for, first of all, she has not the key of the cellar; and, in the next
                  place, she is bound to kiss her relations, and those of her husband, down to
                  cousins, and to do this every day when she first sees them; and besides this, she
                  is forced to be on her best behaviour, as it is quite uncertain whom she may
                  chance to meet; for if she has merely tasted wine, it needs no informer, but is
                  sure to betray itself."</p>
               <p>And Alcimus the Sicilian, in that book of his which is entitled the Italian
                  History, says that all the women in Italy avoid drinking wine on this account:
                     <quote>When Hercules was in the district of the Crotoniatæ, he one day was very
                     thirsty, and came to a certain house by the wayside and asked for something to
                     drink; and it happened that the wife of the master of the house had privily
                     opened a cask of wine, and therefore she said to her husband that it would be a
                     shameful thing for him to open this cask for a stranger; and so she bade him
                     give Hercules some water. But Hercules, who was standing at the door, and heard
                     all this, praised her husband very much, but advised him to go indoors himself
                     and look at the cask. And when he had gone in, he found that the cask had
                     become petrified. And this fact is proved by the conduct of the women of the
                     country, among whom it is reckoned disgraceful, to this day, to drink wine, on
                     account of the above-mentioned reason.</quote>

               <p>And whole nations are mentioned as addicted to drunkenness. Accordingly, Bæton,
                  the measurer of distances for Alexander, in his book which is entitled Stations of
                  the March of Alexander, and Amyntas also, in his Stations, says that the nation of
                  the Tapyri is so fond of wine that they never use any other unguent than that. And
                  Ctesias tells the same story, in his book Concerning the Revenues in Asia. And he
                  says that they are a most just people. And Harmodius of Lepreum, in his treatise
                  on the Laws in force among the people of Phigalea, says that the Phigaleans are
                  addicted to drinking, being neighbours of the Messenians, and being also a people
                  much accustomed to travelling. And Phylarchus, in his sixth book, says that the
                  Byzantians are so exceedingly fond of wine, that they live in the wine-shops and
                  let out their own houses and their wives also to strangers: and that they cannot
                  bear to hear the sound of a trumpet even in their sleep. On which account once,
                  when they were attacked by the enemy, and could not endure the labour of defending
                  their walls, Leonidas, their general, ordered the innkeepers' booths to be erected
                  as tents upon the walls, and even then it was with difficulty that they were
                  stopped from deserting, as Damon tells us, in his book on Byzantium. But Menander,
                  in his play called the Woman carrying the Mysterious sacred Vessels of Minerva, or
                  the Female Flute-player, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     went to. So Cleomenes the tyrant stopped all this; he who also ordered the
                     female pimps, who were accustomed to seduce free-born women, and also three or
                     four of the most nobly born of those who had been induced to prostitute
                     themselves, to be sewn in sacks and thrown into the sea.</quote> And Hermippus,
                  in his account of the Seven Wise Men, says Periander did the same thing. But in
                  the second book of his History of the Exploits of Philip he says, <quote>The
                     Illyrians both eat and drink in a sitting posture; and they take their wives to
                     their entertainments; and it is reckoned a decorous custom for the women to
                     pledge the guests who are present. And they lead home their husbands from their
                     drinking parties; and they all live plainly, and when they drink, they girdle
                     their s stomach with broad girdles, and at first they do so moderately; but
                     when they drink more vehemently, then they keep contracting <pb n="v.2.p.700"/> their belt. And the Ariæans,</quote> says he, <quote>have three hundred

                     and they get drunk every day, and make large entertainments, and are very
                     intemperate in their eating and drinking. On which account the Celtæ when
                     making war upon them, knowing their intemperance, ordered all the soldiers to
                     prepare as superb a feast as possible in the tent, and to put in the food some
                     medicinal herbs which had the power to gripe and purge the bowels exceedingly.
                     And when this had been done . . . .And so some of them were taken by the Celtæ
                     and put to death, and some threw themselves into the rivers, being unable to

               <p>Now, after Democritus had uttered all this long uninterrupted discourse, Pontianus

                  says, with great cleverness, to those who swallow wine in this way, in his Opora,

                  And, in the sixth book of his Laws, he says—<quote>A city ought to be like a

                     restrained by the opposite and sober deity, enters into a good partnership with

               <p>And when Ulpian was about to add something to this Aemilianus said,—It is time for

                  of Lindus has proposed in her Epigrams; for our companion, Diotimus of Olympia,
                  has discussed that point sufficiently; but we must consider how the comic poets
                  have mentioned it, and what punishment those who have failed to solve it have
                  undergone. And Laurentius said,—Clearchus the Solensian defines the word thus: <quote>
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">γρῖφος,</foreign>
                  </quote> says he, <quote>is a sportive problem, in which we are bidden to seek
                     out, by the exertion of our intellect and powers of investigation, what i
                     proposed to us, which has been uttered for the sake of some honour or some
                     penalty.</quote> And in his discussion on these griphi, the same Clearchus
                  asserts that <quote>there are seven kinds of griphi. In the letter, when we say
                     that there is a certain name of a fish or plant, beginning with a. And
                     similarly, <pb n="v.2.p.708"/> when he who proposes the griphus desires us to
                     mention some name in which some particular letter is or is not. Such are those
                     which are called sigma-less griphi; on which account Pindar has composed an ode
                     on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς,</foreign> as if some griphus had been proposed
                     to him as a subject for a lyric poem. Then griphi are said to be in the
                     syllable, when we are desired to recite some verse which begins with the
                     syllable <foreign xml:lang="grc">βα,</foreign> as with <foreign xml:lang="grc">βασιλεὺς,</foreign> for instance, or which ends with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναξ,</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλλιάναξ,</foreign> or some in
                     which the syllables <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεων</foreign> take the lead, as
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεωνίδης,</foreign> or on the other hand close the
                     sentence, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρασυλέωϝ.</foreign> They are in the name,
                     when we utter simple or compound names of two syllables, by which some tragic
                     figure, or on the other hand some humble one, is indicated; or some names which
                     have no connexion with anything divine, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλεώνυμος,</foreign> or which have some such connexion, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">διονύσιος</foreign>: and this, too, whether the connexion be
                     with one God or with more, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ʽἑρμαφρόδιτος;</foreign> or
                     whether the name begins with Jupiter, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">διοκλῆς,</foreign> or with Mercury, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ʽἑρμόδωρος;</foreign> or whether it ends, as it perhaps may, with <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῖκος.</foreign> And then they who were desired to say such and
                     such things, and could not, had to drain the cup.</quote> And Clearchus defined
                  the word in this way. And now you, my good friend Ulpian, may inquire what the cup
                  to be drained is.</p>

                  the following reasons for her opinion, because that is the instrument with which
                  men dig and cut, and that is the material which they use for all purposes. And
                  when she had been applauded, the second damsel said that a blacksmith exerted much
                  greater strength, for that he, when he was at work, bent this strong iron, and
                  softened it, and used it for whatever purposes he chose. And the third said, they

                  the scytale, we are told plainly enough by Apollonius Rhodius, in his Treatise on

                  on the Pupils of Isocrates, was a wonderfully clever man at discovering any
                  riddles that might be proposed to him, and that he too could propose riddles to
                  others with great acuteness. As that riddle about shade, for instance;— for he
                  said that there was a nature which is greatest at its birth and at its decease,
                  and least when at its height. And he speaks thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Greater than all the objects that surround it.</l>
                  </quote> And in the Œdipus, which is a tragedy, he speaks of night and day in the
                  following riddle:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There are two sisters, one of whom brings forth</l>

               <p>And Callisthenes, in his Greek History, tells the following story, that
                     <quote>when the Arcadians were besieging Cromnus, (and that is a small town
                     near Megalopolis,) Hippodamus the Lacedæmonian, being one of the besieged
                     persons, gave a message to the herald who came to them from the Lacedæmonians,
                     showing the condition in which they were by a riddle, and he bade him tell his
                     mother-'to be sure and release within the next ten days the little woman who
                     was bound in the temple of Apollo; as it would not be possible to release her
                     if they let those days elapse.' And by this message he plainly enough intimated
                     what he was desirous to have understood; for the little woman meant is Famine,
                     of which there was a picture in the temple of Apollo, near the throne of
                     Apollo, and it was represented under a woman's form; so it was evident to every
                     one that those who were besieged could hold out only ten days more because of
                     famine. So the Lacedæmonians, understanding the meaning of that had been said,
                     brought succour with great speed to the men in Cromnus.</quote>

                  the following kind:—A clown once had eaten too much, and was very unwell, and when
                  the physician asked him whether he had eaten to vomit, No, said he, but I ate to
                  my stomach. And another was,— A poor woman had a pain in her stomach, and when the
                  physician asked her whether she had anything in her stomach, How should I, said
                  she, when I have eaten nothing for three days?</p>
               <p>And the writings of Aristonymus were full of pompous ex- pressions: and Sosiphanes
                  the poet said to Cephisocles the actor, reproaching him as a man fond of long
                  words, <quote>I would throw a stone at your loins, if I were not afraid of wetting
                     the bystanders.</quote> But the logical griphus is the oldest kind, and the one
                  most suited to the natural character of such enigmatical language. <quote>What do
                     we all teach when We do not know it ourselves</quote> and, <quote>What is the
                     same nowhere and everywhere?</quote> and also, <quote>What is the same in the
                     heavens and on the earth and in the sea?</quote> But this is a riddle arising
                  from an identity of name; for there is a bear, and a serpent, and an eagle, and a
                  dog, both in the heavens and on the earth and in the sea. And the other riddle
                  means Time; for that is the same to all people and everywhere, because it has not
                  its nature depending on one place. And the first riddle means <quote>How to
                     live:</quote> for though no one knows this himself he teaches his

               <p>And Callias the Athenian, whom we were discussing just now, and who was a little
                  before Strattis in point of time, wrote a play which he called Grammatical
                  Science; and the plot of it was as follows. The prologue consists of the <pb n="v.2.p.716"/> elements, and the actor should recite it, dividing it into
                  para- graphs, and making the termination in the manner of a dramatic catastrophe,
                  into <quote>Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, eta, theta. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ει</foreign> is sacred to the God; iota, cappa, lambda, mu, nu, xu, the
                     diphthong ou, pi, rho, sigma, tau, the present u, phi, chi, which is next to
                     psi, all down to omega.</quote> And the chorus consisted of women, in pairs,
                  made of two elements taken together, composed in metre and lyrical odes in this
                  fashion —<quote>Beta alpha ba, beta ei be, beta eta be, beta iota bi, beta ou bo,
                     beta upsilon bu, beta omega bo.</quote> And then, again, in the antistrophe of
                  the ode and of the metre, <quote>Gamma alpha, gamma ei, gamma eta, gamma iota,
                     gamma omicron, gamma upsilon, gamma omega.</quote> And in the same way he dealt
                  with all other syllables—all which have the same melody and the same metre in the
                  antistrophes. So that people not only suspect that Euripides drew all his Medea
                  from this drama, but they think that it is perfectly plain that he drew the system
                  of his choruses from it. And they say that Sophocles, after he had heard this
                  drama, endeavoured to divide his poem in respect of the metre, and did it thus, in
                  the Œdipus,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I shall not grieve myself nor you,</l>
                     <l>Being convicted of this action.</l>
                  </quote> On which account, all the rest admitted the system of antistrophes from
                  his example, as it should seem, into their tragedies. Then, after this chorus,
                  Callias introduces another speech of vowels, in this manner: (and this also the
                  reciter must divide into paragraphs in the same way as the previous portions, in
                  order that that delivery may be preserved which the author originally intended)—

                  </quote> But some say that these verses were inscribed on some one of the ancient
                  offerings which were dedicated at Chalcis; and that on it were represented the
                  figures of a goat and a dolphin; to which animals allusion is made in the above
                  lines. And others say that a dolphin and a goat were embossed in that part of a
                  psaltery where the strings are put in, and that they are what is meant here; and
                  that the bull-slaying servant of Bacchus is the dithyrambic. And others say that
                  the ox which is sacrificed to Bacchus in the town of Iulis is struck with an axe
                  by some one of the young men: and that the festival being near, the axe had been
                  sent to a forge, and Simonides, being then a young man, went to the smith to fetch
                  it; and that when he found the man asleep, and his bellows and his tongs lying
                  loosely about with their fore parts touching one another, he then came back, and
                  told the before-mentioned problem to his friends. For the father of a kid he
                  called the bellows, and the sad fish the tongs (which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρκῖνος,</foreign> or the crab). The son of Night is sleep, and
                  the bull-slaying servant of Bacchus is the axe. And Simonides composed also

                  </quote> And it is said, that when he was sojourning at Carthea he used to train
                  choruses; and that the place where these exercises took place was in the upper
                  part of the city, near the temple of Apollo, a long way from the sea; so that all
                  the rest of the citizens, and Simonides himself, went down to get water, to a
                  place where there was a fountain; an that an ass, whose name was Epeus, used to
                  carry the water up for them; and they gave him this name, because there was a
                  fable that Epeus himself used to do this; and there was also represented in a
                  picture, in the temple of Apollo, th Trojan fable, in which Epeus is represented
                  as drawing water for the Atridæ; as Stesichorus also relates— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  imposed on every member of the choruses who was not present at the appointed time,
                  that he should give the ass a chœnix of barley; and that this is stated by the
                  same poet; and that what is meant by not liking to win the grasshopper's prize, is
                  not liking to sing; and that by Panopeiadean is meant the ass, and the mighty
                  feast is the chœnix of barley.</p>

                     the most delicious, or what kind of fish is nicest, or what is most in season
                     at the moment; or again, what fish is best to eat at the time of Arcturus, or
                     what after the rising of the Pleiades, or of the Dogstar. And then they offer
                     kisses as prizes for those who gain the victory in such questions; such as are
                     hateful to men of liberal sentiments; and as a punishment for those who are
                     defeated they enjoin them to drink sheer wine; which they drink more willingly
                     than the cup of health. For these things are well adapted to any one who has
                     devoted his attention to the writings of Philænis and Archestratus, or who has
                     studied the books called Gastro- <pb n="v.2.p.723"/> logies. They preferred
                     such plays as these;—when the first person had recited a verse, the others were
                     bound to quote the verse following; or if any one had quoted a sentence from
                     some poet, the rest were bound to produce a sentence from some other poet
                     expressing the same sentiments. After that, every one was bound to repeat an
                     iambic. And then, each person was to repeat a line of such and such a number of
                     syllables precisely; and so on with everything that related to any acquaintance
                     with letters and syllables. And in a similar manner they would be bound to
                     repeat the names of all the commanders in the army which attacked Troy, or of
                     all the Trojan leaders: or to tell the name of some city in Asia beginning with
                     a given letter; and then the next person was to tell the name of a city in
                     Europe: and then they were to go through the rest according as they were
                     desired to give the names of Grecian or barbarian cities; so that this sport,
                     not being an inconsiderate one, was a sort of exhibition of the ability and
                     learning of each individual. And the prizes given were a garland and applause,
                     things by which love for one another is especially sweetened.</quote>

               <p>It is worth while, I say, to inquire whether the ancients drank out of large cups.
                  For Dicæarchus the Messenian, the pupil of Aristotle, in his Essay on Alcæus, says
                  that they used small cups, and that they drank their wine mixed with a good deal
                  of water. But Chamæleon of Heraclea, in his essay on Drunkenness, (if I only
                  recollect his words correctly,) says—<quote>But if those who are in power and who
                     are rich prefer this drunkenness to other pleasures, it is no great wonder, for
                     as they have no other pleasure superior to this, nor more easy to obtain, they
                     naturally fly to wine: on which account it has become customary among the
                     nobles to use large drinking-cups. For this is not at all an ancient custom
                     among the Greeks; but one that has been lately adopted, and imported from the
                     barbarians. For they, being destitute of education, rush eagerly to much wine,
                     and provide themselves with all kinds of superfluous delicacies. But in the
                     various countries of Greece, we neither find in pictures nor in poems any trace
                     of any cups of large size being made, except indeed in the heroic times. For
                     the cup which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥυτὸν</foreign> they <pb n="v.2.p.728"/> attributed only to the heroes, which fact will appear a
                     per- plexing one to some people; unless indeed any one should choose to say
                     that this custom was introduced because of the fierceness of the appearance of
                     these demigods. For they think the heroes irascible and quarrelsome, and more
                     so by night than by day. In order, then, that they may appear to be so, not in
                     consequence of their natural disposition, but because of their propensity for
                     drinking, they represent them as drinking out of large cups. And it appears to
                     me not to have been a bad idea on the part of those people who said that a
                     large cup was a silver well.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>In all this Chamæleon appears to be ignorant that it is not a small cup which in
                  Homer is given to the Cyclops by Ulysses; for if it had been a small one, he would
                  not have been so overcome with drunkenness after drinking it three times only,
                  when he was a man of such a monstrous size. There were therefore large cups at
                  that time; unless any one chooses to impute it to the strength of the wine, which
                  Homer himself has mentioned, or to the little practice which the Cyclops had in
                  drinking, since his usual beverage was milk; or perhaps it was a barbaric cup,
                  since it was a big one, forming perhaps a part of the plunder of the Cicones. What
                  then are we to say about Nestor's cup, which a young man would scarcely have had
                  strength enough to carry, but which the aged Nestor lifted without any labour;
                  concerning which identical cup Plutarch shall give us some information. However,
                  it is time now to lie down at table.</p>

                  birth, who was one of the comrades of Hercules. And they are mentioned also by
                  Scythinus the Teian, in his work entitled The History, <pb n="v.2.p.729"/> where
                  he says, <quote>Hercules, having taking Eurytus and his son, put them to death for
                     exacting tribute from the people of Eubœa. And he laid waste the territory of
                     the Cylicranes for behaving like robbers; and there he built a city called
                     Heraclea of Trachis.</quote> And Polemo, in the first of his books, addressed
                  to Adæus and Antigonus, speaks thus—<quote>But the inhabitants of the Heraclea
                     which is at the foot of Mount Œta, and of Trachis, are partly some Cylicranes
                     who came with Hercules from Lydia, and partly Athamanes, some of whose towns
                     remain to this day. And the people of Heraclea did not admit them to any of the
                     privileges of citizenship, considering them only as foreigners sojourning
                     amongst them; and they were called Cylicranes, because they had the figure of a

                  until they get to such a distance that the shield in the temple of Minerva cannot
                  be seen; and then they let it fall into the sea, being an earthenware cup, putting

               <p>And we may add to all this, that different cities have peculiar fashions of
                  drinking and pledging one another; as Critias mentions, in his Constitution of the

                     cups, passing them on towards the right hand; and the Athenian also passes the
                     wine round towards the right, but drinks out of small cups. But the Thessalian
                     uses large cups, pledging whoever he pleases, without reference to where he may
                     be; but among the Lacedæmonians, ever one drinks out of his own cup, and a
                     slave, acting as cupbearer, fills up again the cup when each has drained

                     parties, because of the pleasure which they afford, and also because, when they
                     are warmed, they deprive the wine of some of its intoxicating properties; for
                     they are filled with myrrh and rushes, and other things of the same sort, put
                     into water and then boiled; and when this mixture is put into the wine, the
                     drinkers are less apt to become intoxicated.</quote> And in another place he
                     says—<quote>The Rhodiacan cups consist of myrrh, flowery rushes, saffron,
                     balsam, spikenard, and cinnamon, all boiled together; and when some of this
                     compound is added to the wine, it has such effect in preventing intoxication,

               <p>Let us, then, as was the custom among the Athenians, drink our wine while
                  listening to these jesters and buffoons, and to other artists of the same kind.
                  And Philochorus speaks of this kind of people in these terms—<quote>The Athenians,
                     in the festivals of Bacchus, originally used to go to the spectacle after they
                     had dined and drunk their wine; and they used to witness the games with
                     garlands on their heads. But during the whole time that the games were going
                     on, wine was continually being offered to them, and sweetmeats were constantly
                     being brought round; and when the choruses entered, they were offered wine; and
                     also when the exhibition was over, and they were departing, wine was offered to
                     them again. And Pherecrates the comic poet bears witness to all these things,
                     and to the fact that down to his own time the spectators were never left
                     without refreshment.</quote> And Phanodemus says—"At the temple of Bacchus,
                  which is in the Marshes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν λίμναις</foreign>), the
                  Athenians bring wine, and mix it out of the cask for the god, and then drink of it
                  themselves; on which account Bacchus is also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">λιμναῖος,</foreign> because the wine was first drunk at that festival mixed
                  with water. On which account the fountains were called Nymphs and te Nurses of
                  Bacchus, because the water being mingled with the wine increases the quantity of
                  the wine.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, men being delighted with this mixture, celebrated Bacchus in their
                  songs, dancing and invoking him under the names of Euanthes, and Dithyrambus, and
                  Baccheutes, and Bromius." And Theophrastus, in hi treatise on Drunkenness,

                     Neptune's horses; but that a great wave having been cast on the shore, he had
                     swam with it, and so come to land: and he had in his hand a goblet made of
                     gold, of such wondrous workmanship that the golden goblets which they had, when
                     compared with his, looked no better than brass.</quote>

                  and that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφικύπελλον</foreign> is equivalent to
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερφίαλον,</foreign> that is to say, superb and
                  magnificent; unless, indeed, any one chooses to interpret the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλεισον</foreign> as something very highly ornamented, and
                  therefore not at all smooth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">α,λεῖον</foreign>). And
                  Pisander says, Hercules gave Telamon a cup (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλεισον</foreign>) as the prize of his preeminent valour in the expedition

                  in the temple of Diana; covered with writing taken from the poems of Homer, and
                  beautifully engraved; having the verses inlaid in golden characters, like the
                  drinking-cup of Nestor. And Achæus the tragic poet, in his Omphale, himself also
                  represents the Satyrs speaking in the following manner about a lettered
                  drinking-cup— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And omicron were not deficient.</l>
                  </quote> But in this passage we want the final v which ought to have ended the
                  word. Since all the ancients used the omicron not only with the power which it has
                  now, but also when they meant to indicate the diphthong <foreign xml:lang="grc">ει</foreign> they wrote it by o only. And they did the same when they wished
                  to write the vowel <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε,</foreign> whether it is sounded by
                  itself, or when they wish to indicate the diphthong <foreign xml:lang="grc">ει</foreign> by the addition of iota. And accordingly, in the above-cited
                  verses, the Satyrs wrote the final syllable of the genitive case <foreign xml:lang="grc">διονύσου</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο</foreign> only; as
                  being short to engrave: so that we are in these lines to understand the final
                  upsilon, so as to make the whole word <foreign xml:lang="grc">διονύσου.</foreign>
                  And the Dorians called sigma san; for the musicians, as Aristoxenus often tells
                  us, used to avoid saying sigma whenever they could, because it was a hard-sounding
                  letter, and unsuited to the flute; but they were fond of using the letter rho,
                  because of the ease of pronouncing it. And the horses which have the letter
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> branded on them, they call samphoras.

                  commands obey'd Which wise Adrastus laid on them. They took A silver goblet, and
                  they pour'd therein Water, and honey pure, compounding deftly; And quickly then
                  they all distributed The cups (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δέπαστπα</foreign>) among the
                  princes of the Greeks, Who there were feasting; and from a golden jug They pour'd
                  them wine for due libations. And in another place he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Let others bring the bowl of solid silver,</l>
                     <l>Or golden cups (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δέπαστρα</foreign>), which in my halls

               <p>There is also a kind of cup called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δακτυλωτὸν,</foreign>

                  which a person could put his fingers on each side. Others, again, explain it as
                  meaning, having figures like fingers engraved all round it; or having small
                  projections like the Sidonian cups;—or, again, some interpret the word as meaning
                  merely smooth. But when he says, untouched by fire, that has the same meaning as

                  about the Molossian district the oxen are said to have enormous horns; and the way
                  in which they are made into cups is explained by Theopompus: and it is very likely
                  that Pelias may have had cups made of these horns; and Iolcos is near the
                  Molossian district, and it was at Iolcos that these contests spoken of were
                  exhibited by Pelias.—<quote>But,</quote> says Didymus, in his Explanation of the
                  play here spoken of, <quote>it is better to say that Ion misunderstood Homer's
                     words, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     a large flat vessel made of brass in the form of a caldron, suitable to receive
                     cold water. And he has spoken of the dactylotus cup, as if it were a goblet
                     that had a hollow place all round the inside of it, so as to be taken hold of
                     inside by the fingers of the drinkers. And some say that the cup which has
                     never been touched by fire means a cup of horn; for that that is not worked by
                     the agency of fire. And perhaps a man might call a <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιάλη</foreign> a drinking-cup by a metaphorical use of the word.</quote>

               <p>There was another kind of cup called the Herculeum. Pisander, in the second book
                  of his Herculead, says that the cup in which Hercules sailed across the ocean
                  belonged to the Sun; and that Hercules received it from Oceanus for that purpose.
                  But, perhaps, as the hero was fond of large cups, the poets and historians jesting
                  because of the great size of this one, invented the fable of his having gone to
                  sea in a cup. But Panyasis, in the first book of his Herculead, says that Hercules
                  obtained the cup of the Sun from Nereus, and sailed even to Erythea in it. And we
                  have said before that Hercules was one of the inordinate drinkers. And that the
                  sun was borne on towards his setting in a cup, Stesichorus tells us, where he
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But Theolytus, in the second book of his Annals, says that the Sun
                  crosses the sea in a cup, and that the first person who invented this statement
                  was the author of the poem called the Battle of the Titans. And Pherecydes, in the
                  third book of his Histories, having previously spoken about the ocean,
                     adds—<quote>But Hercules drew his bow against him, as if he meant to shoot him:
                     and the Sun bade him desist, and so he, being afraid, did desist. And in return
                     for his forbearance, the Sun gave him the golden cup in which he himself used
                     to travel with his horses when he has set, going all night across the ocean to
                     the east, where he again rises. And so then Hercules went in this cup to
                     Erythea. And when he was at sea, Oceanus, to tempt him, appeared to him in
                     visible form, tossing his cup about in the waves; and he then was on the point
                     of shooting Oceanus; but Oceanus being frightened desired him to

               <p>There is also a kind of cup called carchesium. Callixenus the Rhodian, in' his
                  History of the Affairs and Customs of Alexandria, says that it is a cup of an
                  oblong shape, slightly contracted in the middle, having ears which reach down to
                  the bottom. And indeed, the carchesium is a tolerably oblong cup, and perhaps it
                  has its name from its being stretched upwards. But the carchesium is an extremely
                  old description of cup; if at least it is true that Jupiter, when he had gained
                  the affections of Alcmena, gave her one as a love gift, as Pherecydes relates in
                  his second book, and Herodorus of Heraclea tells the same story. But Asclepiades
                  the Myrlean says that this cup derives its name from some one of the parts of the
                  equipment of a ship. For the lower part of the mast is called the pterna, which
                  goes down into the socket; and the middle of the mast is called the neck; and
                  towards the upper part it is called carchesium. And the carchesium has yards
                  running out on each side, and in it there is placed what is called the
                  breastplate, being four-cornered on all sides, except just at the bottom and at
                  the top. Both of which extend a little outwards in a straight line. And above the
                  breastplate is a part which is called the distaff, running up to a great height,
                  and being sharp-pointed. And Sappho also speaks of the carchesia, where she says—
                     <pb n="v.2.p.757"/>
                  <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And they all had well-fill'd carchesia,</l>
                     <l>And out of them they pour'd libations, wishing</l>
                     <l>All manner of good fortune to the bridegroom.</l>
                  </quote> And Sophocles, in his Tyro, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And they were at the table in the middle,</l>
                     <l>Between the dishes and carchesia;</l>
                  </quote> saying that the dragons came up to the table, and took up a position
                  between the meats and the carchesia, or cups of wine. For it was the fashion among
                  the ancients to place upon the table goblets containing mixed wine; as Homer also
                  represents the tables in his time. And the carchesium was named so from having on
                  it rough masses like millet (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κεγχροειδὴς</foreign>), and the
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign> is by enallage instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε, καρχήσιον</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερχήσιον.</foreign> On which account Homer calls those who are overcome by

                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλέους.</foreign> And Charon of Lampsacus, in his Annals,
                  says that among the Lacedæmonians there is still shown the very same cup which was
                  given by Jupiter to Alcmena, when he took upon himself the likeness of
                  Amphitryon.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of cup called calpium, a sort of Erythræan goblet, as
                  Pamphilus says; and I imagine it is the same as the one called scaphium.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="50">
               <p>There is another kind of cup called celebe. And this description of drinking-cup
                  is mentioned by Anacreon, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Come, O boy, and bring me now</l>
                     <l>A celebe, that I may drink</l>
                     <l>A long deep draught, and draw no breath.</l>
                     <l>It will ten measures of water hold,</l>
                     <l>And five of mighty Chian wine.</l>
                  </quote> But it is uncertain what description of cup it is, or whether every cup
                  is not called celebe, because one pours libations into it (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ χέειν λοιβὴν</foreign>),or from one's pouring libations (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λείβειν</foreign>). And the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείβω</foreign> is applied habitually to every sort of liquid, from which also
                  the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέβης</foreign> is derived. But Silenus and
                  Clitarchus say that celebe is a name given to drinking-cups by the Aeolians. But
                  Pamphilus says that the celebe is the same cup which is also called thermopotis, a
                  cup to drink warm water from. And Nicander the Colophonian, in his Dialects, says
                  that the celebe is a vessel used by the shepherds in which they preserve honey.
                  For Anti- machus the Colophonian, in the fifth book of his Thebais, says— <pb n="v.2.p.758"/>

                  </quote> And in this passage he very evidently speaks of the celebeum as some kind
                  of vessel distinct from a drinking-cup, since he has already mentioned
                  drinking-cups under the title of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέπαστρα.</foreign> And

               <p>There is also the horn. It is said that the first men drank out of the horns of
                  oxen; from which circumstance Bacchus often figured with horns on his head, and is
                  moreover called a bull by many of the poets. And at Cyzicus there is a statue of
                  him with a bull's head. But that men drank out of horns (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κέρατα</foreign>) is plain from the fact that to this very day, when men mix
                  water with wine, they say that they <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερᾶσαι</foreign> (mix
                  it). And the vessel in which the wine is mixed is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρατὴρ,</foreign> from the fact of the water being mingled (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκιρνᾶσθαι</foreign>) in it, as if the word were <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερατὴρ,</foreign> from the drink being poured <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὸ κέρας</foreign> (into the horn); and even to this day the

                  that this word is used by Euripides in the Andromache, to signify a cup made of
                  ivy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κίσσινον</foreign>)— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And all the crowd of shepherds flock'd together,</l>
                     <l>One bearing a huge ivy bowl of milk,</l>

                     <l>Another brought the juice o' the purple vine.</l>
                  </quote> For, says he, the cissybium is mentioned in a rustic assembly, where it
                  is most natural that the cups should be made of wood. But Clitarchus says that the
                  Aeolians called the cup which is elsewhere called scyphus, cissybium. And Marsyas
                  says that it is a wooden cup, the same as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύπελλον.</foreign> But Eumolpus says that it is a species of cup which
                  perhaps (says he) was originally made of the wood of the ivy. But Nicander the
                  Colophonian, in the first book of his History of Aetolia, writes thus:—"In the
                  sacred festival of Jupiter Didymæus they pour libations from leaves of ivy
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσοῦ</foreign>), from which circumstance the ancient
                  cups are called cissybia. Homer says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Holding a cup (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσύβιον</foreign>) of dark
                        rich-colour'd wine.</l>
                  </quote> And Asclepiades the Myrlean, in his essay on the cup called Nestoris,
                  says, <quote>No one of the men in the city or of the men of moderate fortune used
                     to use the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκύφος</foreign> or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσύβιον,</foreign> but only the swineherds and the shepherds, and the men
                     in the fields. Polyphemus used the cissybium, and Eumæus the other
                     kind.</quote> But Callimachus seems to make a blunder in the use of these
                  names, speaking of an intimate friend of his <pb n="v.2.p.761"/> who was
                  entertained with him at a banquet by Pollis the Athenian, for he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And soberly preferr'd a small cissybium:</l>
                     <l>And when for the third time the cup (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλεισον</foreign>) went round,</l>
                     <l>I thus addressed him . . . . . .</l>
                  </quote> For, as he here calls the same cup both <foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσύβιον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλεισον,</foreign> he does not
                  preserve the accurate distinction between the names. And any one may conjecture
                  that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσύβιον</foreign> was originally made by the
                  shepherds out of the wood of the ivy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσός</foreign>). But
                  some derive it from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">χεύμαι,</foreign> used in the
                  same sense as <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωρέω,</foreign> to contain; as it occurs in
                  the fol- lowing line:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And the hole of the serpent is also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">χείη,</foreign> as containing the animal; and they also give the name of
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">κήθιον,</foreign> that is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χήτιον,</foreign> to the box which holds the dice. And Dionysius of Samos, in
                  his treatise on the Cyclic Poets, calls the cup which Homer calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσύβιον, κύμβιον,</foreign> writing thus—<quote>And Ulysses,
                     when he saw him acting thus, having filled a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύμβιον</foreign> with wine, gave it to him to drink.</quote>

                  And when the cup had gone round pretty often, he, having drunk very hard and being
                  intoxicated, took one of the ciboria and defiled it. And Didymus says that it is a

                     might contest the victory, all being at an equal distance, and in similar

               <p>But Eratosthenes, in his letter addressed to Ageton the Lacedæmonian, says, that

                     men marvel how a man who had not got a cyathus, but only a cymbium, had,
                     besides that, also a phiale. Now it seems to me, that he had one for the use of
                     men, but the other for the purpose of doing honour to the Gods. And at that
                     time they never used the cyathus nor the cotyla. For they used to employ, in
                     the sacrifices of the Gods, a crater, not made of silver nor inlaid with
                     precious stones, but made of Coliad clay. And as often as they replenished
                     this, pouring a libation to the Gods out of the phiale, they then poured out
                     wine to all the company in order, bailing out the newly-mixed wine in a
                     cymbium, as they do now among us at the phiditia. And if ever they wished to
                     drink more, they also placed on the table beside them the cups called cotyli,
                     which are the most beautiful of all cups, and the most convenient to drink out
                     of. And these, too, were all made of the same earthenware.</quote> But when

                  either very fond of wine, or who had an evil reputation on some other account, as
                  Antiochus of Alexandria says, in his treatise on the Poets, who are ridiculed by
                  the comic writers of the Middle Comedy. For the circumstance of cymbia being
                  introduced into entertainments, and being used to fight with in drunken quarrels,

                     convenient when one is on an expedition, and the most easily carried in a
                     knapsack. And the reason why it is so peculiarly well-suited to a soldier is,
                     because a soldier often is forced to drink water which is not very clean; and,
                     in the first place, this cup is not one in which it can be very easily seen
                     what one is drinking; and, secondly, as its brim is rather curved inwards, it

                     they drink out of cups made of earthenware at the festivals, and in the feasts
                     in honour of victory, and at the marriage-feasts of their maidens. But at other

               <p>But with respect to drinking, (which from the name of this kind of cup is
                  sometimes called in the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωθωνί-</foreign>
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζομαι,</foreign> and in the substantive <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωθωνισμὸς,</foreign> that occasional drinking is good for the

                  subject of Drinking (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κωθωνισμὸς</foreign>), where he speaks
                  as follows: <quote>It happens that those who drink a great quantity of unmixed
                     wine at banquets often receive great injury from so doing, both in their bodies
                     and minds; but still occasional hard drinking (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κωθωνι-</foreign>
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζεσθαι</foreign>) for some days appears to me to produce
                     a certain purging of the body and a certain relaxation of the mind. For there
                     are some little roughnesses on the surface, arising from daily banquets; now
                     for getting rid of these there is no easier channel than the wine. But of all
                     modes of purging, that which' is caused by hard drinking is the most
                     advantageous; for then the body is as it were washed out by the wine; for the
                     wine is both liquid and heating: but the wine which we secrete is harsh;
                     accordingly, fullers use it as a cleanser when they are cleaning garments. But
                     when you are drinking hard, you should guard against three things,— against
                     drinking bad wine, against drinking unmixed wine, and against eating sweetmeats
                     while you are drinking. And when you have had enough, then do not go to sleep,
                     until you have had a vomit, moderate or copious as the case may be; and when
                     you have vomited, then go to sleep after having taken a slight bath. And if you
                     are not able to empty yourself sufficiently, then you must take a more copious
                     bath, and lie down in the bath in exceedingly warm water.</quote> But Polemo,
                  in the fifth book of his treatise addressed to Antigonus and Adæus,

               <p>There is also the Lyciurges. The things which are so called are some kinds of
                  phialæ, which derive their name from Lycon who made them, just as the Cononii are
                  the cups made by Conon. Now, Demosthenes, in his Oration for the Crown, mentions
                  Lycon; and he does so again, in his oration against Timotheus for an assault,
                  where he says—<quote>Two lyciurgeis Phialæ.</quote> And in his speech against

                  these are cups made by Lycius. And this Lycius was a Bœotian by birth, of the town

                  his treatise on the Acropolis of Athens; but the grammarian is ignorant that one
                  could never find such a formation of a word as that derived from proper names, but
                  only from cities or nations. For Aristophanes, in his Peace, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>There is the Nestoris also. Now concerning the shape of the cup of Nestor, the

                     <l>Next her white hand a spacious goblet brings,</l>
                     <l>A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings</l>
                     <l>From eldest times; the massy, sculptured vase,</l>
                     <l>Glittering with golden studs, four handles grace,</l>
                     <l>And curling vines, around each handle roll'd,</l>
                     <l>Support two turtle-doves emboss'd in gold.</l>
                     <l>On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl,</l>
                     <l>Lest the top weight should make it loosely roll:</l>
                     <l>A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,</l>
                     <l>Though all too great for men of lesser limb.</l>
                  </quote> Now with reference to this passage a question is raised, what is the
                  meaning of <quote>glittering with golden studs:</quote>—and again, what is meant
                  by <quote>the massy, sculptured vase four handles grace.</quote> For Asclepiades
                  the Myrlean, in his treatise on the Nestoris, says that the other cups have two
                  handles. <pb n="v.2.p.779"/> And again, how could any one give a representation
                  of turtle- doves feeding around each of the handles? How also can he say,
                     <quote>On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl?</quote> And this also is a very
                  peculiar statement that he makes, that he could heave it with ease, <quote>though
                     all too great for men of lesser limb.</quote> Now Asclepiades proposes all
                  these difficulties, and especially raises the question about the studs, as to how
                  we are to understand that they were fastened on. Now some say that golden studs
                  must be fastened on a silver goblet from the outside, on the principles of
                  embossing, as is mentioned in the case of the sceptre of Achilles— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He spoke,—and, furious, hurl'd against the ground</l>
                     <l>His sceptre, starr'd with golden studs around;</l>
                  </quote> for it is plain here that the studs were let into the sceptre, as clubs
                  are strengthened with iron nails. He also says of the sword of Agamemnon— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,</l>
                     <l>Sustain'd the sword that glittered at his side:</l>
                     <l>Gold were the studs—a silver sheath encased</l>
                     <l>The shining blade.</l>
                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>But Apelles the engraver, he says, showed us on some articles of Corinthian
                  workmanship the way in which studs were put on. For there was a small projection
                  raised up by the chisel, to form, as it were, the heads of the nails. And these
                  studs are said by the poet to be fixed in, not because they are on the outside and
                  are fixed by nails, but because they resemble nails driven through, and project a

               <p>And with respect to the handles, they tell us that this cup had indeed two handles
                  above, like other cups; but that it had also two more on the middle of its convex
                  surface, one on each side, of small size, resembling the Corinthia water- ewers.
                  But Apelles explained the system of the four handles very artistically in the
                  following manner. He said, tat from one root, as it were, which is attached to the
                  bottom of the cup, there are diverging lines extending along each handle, at no
                  great distance from each other: and these reach up to the brim of the cup, and
                  even rise a little above it, and are at the greatest distance from each other at
                  the point where they are furthest from the vessel itself; but at the lower
                  extremity, where they join the rim, they are again united. And in this <pb n="v.2.p.780"/> way there are four handles; but this kind of ornament is not
                  seen in every cup, but only on some, and especially on those which are called
                  seleucides. But with respect to the question raised about the two bases, how it
                  can be said, <quote>On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl,</quote> some people
                  explain that line thus:—that some cups have one bottom, the natural one, being
                  wrought at the same time as, and of one piece with, the whole cup; as for
                  instance, those which are called cymbia, and the phialæ, and others of the same
                  shape as the phialæ. But some have two bottoms; as for instance, the egg-shaped
                  cups called ooscyphia, and those called cantharia, and the seleucides, and the
                  carchesia, and others of this kind. For they say that one of these bottoms is
                  wrought of the same piece as the entire cup, and the other is attached to it,
                  being sharp at the upper part, and broader towards the lower end, as a support for
                  the cup; and this cup of Nestor's, they say, was of this fashion. But the poet may
                  have represented this cup as having two bottoms; the one, that is to say, bearing
                  the whole weight of the cup, and having an elevation proportionate to the height,
                  in accordance, with its greater circumference; and the other bottom might be
                  smaller in circumference, so as to be contained within the circumference of the
                  larger circle, where the natural bottom of the cup becomes sharper; so that the
                  whole cup should be supported on two bases.</p>
               <p>But Dionysius the Thracian is said to have made the cup called Nestor's, at
                  Rhodes, all his pupils contributing silver for the work; of which Promethidas of
                  Heraclea, explaining the way in which it was made on the system of Dionysius, says
                  that it is a cup having its handles made side by side, as the ships with two prows
                  have their prows made; and that turtle-doves are represented sitting on the
                  handles; and that two small sticks, as it were, are placed under the cup as a
                  support to it, running transversely across in a longitudinal direction, and that
                  these are the two bottoms meant by Homer. And we may to this day see a cup of that
                  fashion at Capua, a city of Campania, consecrated to Diana; and the Capuans assert
                  that that is the identical cup which belonged to Nestor. And it is a silver cup,
                  having on it the lines of Homer engraved in golden characters.</p>

               <p>
                  <quote>But I,</quote> said the Myrlean, "have this to say about <pb n="v.2.p.781"/> the cup:—the ancients, who first brought men over to a more civilized system of
                  life, believing that the world was spherical, and taking their ideas of form from
                  the visible forms of the sun and moon which they beheld, and adapting these
                  figures to their own use in the daily concerns of life, thought it right to make
                  all their vessels and other articles of furniture resemble, in shape at least, the
                  heaven which surrounds everything: on which account they made tables round; and so
                  also they made the tripods which they dedicated to the Gods, and they also made
                  their cakes round and marked with stars, which they also call moons. And this is
                  the origin of their giving bread the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρτος,</foreign> because of all figures the circle is the one which is the
                  most complete (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπήρτισται</foreign>), and it is a perfect
                  figure. And accordingly they made a drinking-cup, being that which receives moist
                  nourishment, circular, in imitation of the shape of the world. But the cup of
                  Nestor has something peculiar about it, for it has stars on it, which the poet
                  compares to studs, because the stars are as round as the studs, and are, as it
                  were, fixed in the heaven; as also Aratus says of them— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There do they shine in heaven,—ornaments</l>
                     <l>Fix'd there for ever as the night comes round.</l>
                  </quote> But the poet has expressed this very beautifully, attaching the golden
                  studs to the main body of the silver cup, and so indicating the nature of the
                  stars and of the heaven by the colour of the ornaments. For the heaven is like
                  silver, and the stars resemble gold from their fiery colour.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="79">
               <p>"So after the poet had represented the cup of Nestor as studded with stars, he
                  then proceeds on to the most brilliant of the fixed stars, by contemplating which
                  men form their conjectures of what is to happen to them in their lives. I mean the
                  Pleiades. For when he says <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύο δὲ πελειάδες</foreign> were
                  placed in gold around each handle, he does not mean the birds called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες,</foreign> that is to say, turtle-doves; and those who
                  think that he does use <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες</foreign> here as
                  synonymous with <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστεραὶ</foreign> are wrong. For
                  Aristotle says expressly that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειὰς</foreign> is one
                  bird, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστερὰ</foreign> another. But the poet
                  calls that constellation <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες</foreign> which at
                  present w call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλειάδες;</foreign> by the rising of which
                  men regulate their swing and their reaping, and the beginning of their raising
                  their crops, and their collection of them; as Hesiod says:— <pb n="v.2.p.782"/>
                  <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>When the seven daughters of the Libyan king</l>
                     <l>Rise in the heavens, then begin to mow;</l>
                     <l>And when they hide their heads, then plough the ground.</l>
                  </quote> And Aratus says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Their size is small, their light but moderate,</l>
                     <l>Yet are they famous over all the world;</l>
                     <l>At early dawn and late at eve they roll,</l>
                     <l>Jove regulating all their tranquil motions;</l>
                     <l>He has ordain'd them to give signs to men,</l>
                     <l>When winter, and when summer too begins,—</l>
                     <l>What is the time for ploughing, what for sowing.</l>
                  </quote> And accordingly it is with great appropriateness that the poet has
                  represented the Pleiades, who indicate the time of the generation and approach to
                  perfection of the fruits of the earth, as forming parts of the ornaments of the
                  cup of that wise prince Nestor. For this vessel was intended to contain any kind
                  of food, whether solid or liquid; on which account he also says that the
                  turtle-doves bring ambrosia to Jupiter:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing,</l>
                     <l>That bears ambrosia to th' ethereal king,</l>
                     <l>But shuns these rocks.</l>
                  </quote> For we must not think here that it is really the birds called
                  turtle-doves which bring ambrosia to Jupiter, which is the opinion of many; for
                  that were inconsistent with the majesty of Jupiter; but the daughters of Atlas,
                  turned into the constellation of Pleiades or doves. For it is natural enough that
                  they who indicate the appropriate seasons to the human race should also bring
                  ambrosia to Jupiter, on which account also he distinguishes between them and other
                  birds, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing;</l>
                  </quote> and that he considers the Pleiades as the most famous of all fixed stars
                  is plain, from his having placed them in the first rank when giving a list of
                  other constellations:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd,—</l>

                     <l>The starry lights, that heaven's high convex crown'd,—</l>
                     <l>The Pleiads, Hyads, with the Northern Team,</l>
                     <l>And great Orion's more refulgent beam;</l>
                     <l>To which, around the axle of the sky,</l>
                     <l>The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye;</l>
                     <l>Still shines exalted on th' ethereal plain,</l>
                     <l>Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main,—</l>
                     <l>The Bear, whom trusting rustics call the Wain.</l>

               <pb n="v.2.p.783"/>
               <p>"But people in general have been deceived by fancying the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες</foreign> here spoken of to be birds, first of all from the poetical
                  form of the word, because of the insertion of the letter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε;</foreign> and secondly, because they have taken the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρήρωνες,</foreign> 'trembling,' as an epithet only of doves;
                  since, owing to its weakness, that is a very cautious bird; and when he calls it
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρήρων,</foreign> this word is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρέω,</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρέω</foreign> is the
                  same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐλαβέομαι,</foreign> to be cautious. But still
                  there is a good deal of reason in attributing the same characteristic also to the
                  Pleiades: for the fable is, that they are always fleeing from Orion, since their
                  mother Pleione is constantly pursued by Orion.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="80">
               <p>"And the variation of the name, so that the Pleiades are called both <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλειαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες,</foreign>
                  occurs in many poets. First of all, Myro the Byzantian admirably caught the
                  feeling of the Homeric poems, saying in her poem entitled Memory, that the
                  Pleiades convey ambrosia to Jupiter. But Crates the critic, endeavouring to
                  appropriate to himself the credit due to her, produces that assertion as his own.
                  Simonides also has called the Pleiades <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες,</foreign>
                  in the following lines:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And may great Mercury, whose protecting pow'r</l>
                     <l>Watches o'er contests, Maia's mighty son,</l>
                     <l>Grant you success. But Atlas was the sire</l>
                     <l>Of seven dark-hair'd daughters, beautiful,</l>
                     <l>Surpassing all the maidens upon earth,</l>
                     <l>And now in heaven they're call'd Peleiades.</l>
                  </quote> Here he distinctly calls the Pleiades <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες,</foreign> for they it was who were the daughters of Atlas; as
                  Pindar says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And it is natural</l>
                     <l>That great Oarion should advance</l>
                     <l>Not far from the seven Pleiades, at the tail (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρίας</foreign>).</l>
                  </quote> For, in the arrangement of the stars, Orion is not far from the Pleiades;
                  from which circumstance has arise the fable about them, that they, with their
                  mother Pleione, are always fleeing from Orion. But when he calls the Pleiades
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄριαι</foreign> here, he means <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔριαι,</foreign> only he has left out the <hi rend="italics">v,</hi> because
                  the Pleiades are close to the tail of the Bull. And Aechylus has spoken still more
                  plainly, playing on their name on account of the resemblance of its sound, where
                  he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The seven celebrated daughters of</l>

                     <l>The wingless Peleiades.</l>
                  </quote> For he calls them here wingless on account of the similarity of the sound
                  of their name to that of the birds <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελειάδες</foreign> And
                  Myro herself also speaks in the same manner— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  sections of handles; but if he had said <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκάτερον,</foreign>
                  that would have applied to the fact of their again becoming united at the highest
                  point which they respectively reach. And accordingly, when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And curling vines, around each handle roll'd,</l>
                     <l>Bear two Peleiades emboss'd in gold;</l>
                     <l>On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl;</l>
                  </quote> we are by that to understand one Peleias to. each section of the handles.
                  And he has called them <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοιὰς,</foreign> as being united to
                  one another and grown together as it were. For the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοιαὶ</foreign>, signifies simply the number two, as in the passage— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Two tripods (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δοιοὺς δὲ τρίποδας</foreign>), and ten
                        golden talents;</l>
                  </quote> and again— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Two attendants (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δοιοὶ θεράπογτες</foreign>):</l>
                  </quote> and it also at times intimates a natural connexion subsisting between the
                  two things spoken of, as well as that they are two in number; as in these lines:—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There grew two (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δοιοὶ</foreign>) olives, closest of

                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">υποπυθμενες,</foreign> in order to understand it with
                  reference to the Peleiades, that there were four Peleiades on the handles, and two
                  more <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποπυθμένες,</foreign> which is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ τῷ πυθμένι,</foreign> that is to say, under the pedestal, as

                  Peleiades which lie under the bottom, and in that way there are altogether six
                  Pleiades in all, since that is the number which are seen, though they are said to
                  be seven in number, as Aratus says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>They are indeed declared by mortal man</l>

                  </quote> Accordingly, what is seen in the stars the poet has very suitably
                  described among the ornaments made on the occasion. And many fancy that the poet
                  is here referring to Jupiter, when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing,</l>

                     <l>They fearful meet, and crush her as she flies.</l>
                  </quote> Meaning in reality, that one of the Pleiades was destroyed by the
                  sharpness of the rocks and their smooth edge, and that another is substituted in
                  her place by Jupiter for the sake of keeping the number undiminished. Expressing
                  by the enigmatical figures of speech common to poets, that, though there are only
                  six Pleiades seen, still their real number is not actually diminished; but there
                  are said to be seven in number, and also the names of the seven are distinctly

                  <quote>These are the observations of that admirable solver of difficulties,
                     Sosibius. But Ptolemy Philadelphus the king jested upon him with some wit, on
                     account of this and other much talked-of solutions. For as Sosibius received a
                     royal stipend, Ptolemy, sending for his treasurers, desired them, when Sosibius
                     came to demand his stipend, to tell him that he had received it already. And
                     when, not long after, he did come and ask for his money, they said they had
                     given it to him already, and said no more. But he, going to the king, <pb n="v.2.p.789"/> accused the treasurers. And Ptolemy sent for them, and
                     ordered them to come with their books, in which were the lists of those who
                     received those stipends. And when they had arrived, the king took the books
                     into his hands and looking into them himself, also asserted that Sosibius had
                     received his money; making it out in this way:—These names were set
                     down,—Soter, Sosigenes, Bion, Apollon, Dion; and the king, looking on these
                     names, said—My excellent solver of difficulties, if you take <foreign xml:lang="grc">σω</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωτὴρ,</foreign> and

                  demanded of him two oxybapha when he was going away to trial. For we cannot think
                  that they asked him for anything but cups. And the oxybaphum, which is put before
                  the people who play at the cottabus, into which they pour their drops of wine, can
                  be nothing else but a flat cup. Eubulus also, in his Mylothris, mentions the

                     drink such a quantity of wine that, instead of carrying in their cups, they

                  that this kind of vessel was first made by Ptolemy Philadelphus the king, to be
                  carried by the statues of Ar- sinoe: for in her right hand she bears a vessel of
                  this kind, full of all the fruits of the season; by which the makers of it
                  designed to show that this horn is richer than the horn of Amalthea. And it is
                  mentioned by Theocles, in his Ithyphallics, thus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>And now I go to my dear king.</l>
                  </quote> But Dionysius of Sinope, in his Female Saviour, giving a list of some
                  cups, has also mentioned the rhytus, as I have said <pb n="v.2.p.795"/> before;
                  but Hedylus, in his Epigrams, mentioning the rhytum made by Ctesibius the engineer
                  or machinist, speaks thus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>The true Egyptian Besa, which pours forth</l>

                     <l>It gives a signal for delight and feasting,</l>
                     <l>Such as the Nile, the king of flowing rivers,</l>

                  </quote> But Theophrastus, in his treatise on Drunkenness, says that the cup
                  called the rhytum is given to heroes alone. Dorotheus the Sidonian, says that the
                  rhyta resemble horns, but are perforated at both ends, and men drink of them at
                  the bottom as they send forth a gentle stream; and that it derives its name from
                  the liquor flowing from them <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸτῆς ῥύσεως</foreign>

               <p>There is the sannacra too. Crates, in the fifth book of his treatise on the Attic

                  cup. But Philemon, in his Widow, mentioning the batiacia, and jesting on the
                  ridiculousness of the name, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  says these goblets are very like one another, the Seleucis, the Rhodias, and the

                  and then we form its genitive case without <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> but
                  when <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκύθος</foreign> is neuter, then we must decline with

                  drinking more than was decent. But Hieronymus the Rhodian, in his treatise on
                  Drunkenness, says to get drunk is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκυθίζω;</foreign>;
                  for that <foreign xml:lang="grc">θ</foreign> is a cognate letter to <foreign xml:lang="grc">φ</foreign>. But at subsequent times scyphi were made of
                  earthenware and of silver, in imitation of the wooden ones. And the first makers
                  of cups of this kind were the Bœotians, who obtained a high reputation for their
                  manufacture; because Hercules originally used these cups in his expeditions. On
                  which account they are called Heracleotici by some people. And they are different
                  from other cups; for they have on their handles what is called the chain of
                  Hercules. And Bacchylides mentions the Bœotian scyphi in these words, (addressing
                  his discourse to Castor and Pollux, and invoking their attendance at a banquet)—

                  were the Rhodian ones, of the workmanship of Damocrates. And the next to them were

                     that the barbarians were in the habit of doing everything by deceit and trick;
                     on which account they sent Dercyllidas, thinking that he was the least likely
                     of all men to be taken in; for he was not at all of a Lacedæmonian and simple
                     disposition, but exceedingly cunning and fierce; on which account the

               <p>There is the phiale too. Homer, when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> is not speaking of a drinking-cup, but of a brazen vessel of a flat shape
                  like a caldron, having perhaps two handles, one on each side. But Parthenius the
                  pupil of Dionysius understands by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίθετον</foreign> a
                  phiale without any bottom. But Apollodorus the Athenian, in his short essay on the
                  Crater, says that it means a cup which cannot be firmly placed and steadied on its
                  bottom, but only on its mouth. But some say, that just as the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιφορεὺς</foreign> is used for a cup which can be lifted by its
                  handles on both sides, the same is meant by the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίθετος φιάλη.</foreign> But Aristarchus says that it means a cup which can
                  be placed on either end, on its mouth or on its bottom. But Dionysius the Thracian
                  says that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίθετος</foreign> means round, running
                  round (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιθέων</foreign>) in a circular form. And
                  Asclepiades the Myrlean says,—"The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιάλη,</foreign> by
                  a change of letters, becomes <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιάλη,</foreign> a cup which
                  contains enough to drink (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πιεῖν ἅλις</foreign>); for it is
                  larger than the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτήριον.</foreign> But when Homer calls it
                  also <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπύρωτος,</foreign> he means either that it was wrought
                  without fire, or never put on the fire. On which account he calls a kettle which
                  may be put on the fire <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπυριβήτης,</foreign> and one which
                  is not so used <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπυρος.</foreign> And when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>With flowers high wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame,</l>
                  </quote> he perhaps means one intended to receive cold water. So that the phiale
                  would in that case resemble a flat brazen vessel, holding cold water. But when he
                  calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίθετος,</foreign> can we understand that it has
                  two bases, one on each side; or is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφὶ</foreign> here to be
                  taken as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ,</foreign> and t en again is
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ</foreign> to be taken as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιττὸν,</foreign> so that in fact all that is meant by the
                  epithet is beautifully made; since <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεῖναι</foreign> was
                  often used by the ancients for 'to make?' It may also mean, ' being capable of
                  being placed either on its bottom or upon its mouth;' and such a placing of cups
                  is an Ionian <pb n="v.2.p.802"/> and an ancient fashion. And even now the
                  Massilians often adopt it, and set their goblets down on their mouths."</p>

                  most delightful and witty author Xenophon before your eyes, who in his Banquet
                     says,—<quote>But Socrates, in his turn, said, But it seems to me now, O men,
                     that we ought to drink hard. For wine, in reality, while it moistens the
                     spirit, lulls the griefs to sleep as mandragora does men; but it awakens all
                     cheerful feelings, as oil does fire. And it appears to me that the bodies of
                     men are liable to the same influences which affect the bodies of those things
                     which grow in the ground; for the very plants, when God gives them too much to
                     drink, cannot hold up their heads, nor can they expand at their proper seasons.
                     But when they drink just as much as is good for them, and no more, then they
                     grow in an upright attitude, and flourish, and come in a flourishing state to
                     produce fruit. And so, too, in our case, if we take too much drink all at once,
                     our bodies and our minds rapidly get disordered, and we cannot even breathe
                     correctly, much less speak. But if our slaves bedew us (to use Gorgias-like
                     language) in small quantities with small cups, then we are not compelled to be
                     intoxicated by the wine; but being gently induced, we proceed to a merry and
                     cheerful temperament.</quote>

               <p>Now, any one who considers these expressions of the accomplished Xenophon, may
                  understand how it as that the brilliant Plato displayed such jealousy of him. But
                  perhaps the fact may partly be because these men did from the very <pb n="v.2.p.808"/> beginning feel a spirit of rivalry towards one another, each
                  being aware of his own powers; and perhaps they began very early to contend for
                  the preeminence, as we may conjecture not only from what they have both written
                  about Cyrus, but also from other writings of theirs on similar subjects. For they
                  have both written a piece called the Banquet; and in these two pieces, one of them
                  turns out the female flute-players, and the other introduces them; and one, as has
                  been already said, refuses to drink out of large cups, but the other represents
                  Socrates as drinking out of a psycter till morning. And in his treatise concerning
                  the Soul, Plato, reckoning up all who were present, does not make even the
                  slightest mention of Xenophon. And concerning Cyrus, the one says that from his
                  earliest youth he was trained up in all the national practices of his country; but
                  Plato, as if in the express spirit of contradiction, says, in the third book of
                  his Laws,—<quote>But with respect to Cyrus, I consider that, as to other things,
                     he was indeed a skilful and careful general, but that he had never had the very
                     least particle of a proper education, and that he had never turned his mind the
                     least in the world to the administration of affairs. But he appears from his
                     earliest youth to have been engaged in war, and to have given his children to
                     his wives to bring up.</quote> And again, Xenophon, who joined Cyrus with the
                  Ten Thousand Greeks, in his expedition into Persia, and who was thoroughly
                  acquainted with the treachery of Meno the Thessalian, and knew that he was the
                  cause of the murder of Clearchus by Tissaphernes, and who knew also the
                  disposition of the man, how morose and debauched he was,—has given us a full
                  account of everything concerning him. But the exquisite Plato, who all but says,
                     <quote>All this is not true,</quote> goes through a long panegyric on him, who
                  was incessantly calumniating every one else. And in his Polity, he banishes Homer
                  from his city, and all poetry of the theatrical kind; and yet he himself wrote
                  dialogues in a theatrical style,—a manner of writing of which he himself was not
                  the inventor; for Alexamenus the Teian had, before him, invented this style of
                  dialogue, as Nicias of Nicæa and Sotion both agree in relating. And Aristotle, in
                  his treatise on Poets, writes thus:—<quote>Let us not then call those Mimes, as
                     they are called, of Sophron, which are written in metre, Discourses and
                     Imitations; or those Dialogues of Alexamenus <pb n="v.2.p.809"/> of Teos,
                     which were written before the Scratic Dialogues;</quote> — Aristotle, the most
                  learned of all men, stating here most expressly that Alexamenus composed his
                  Dialogues before Plato. And Plato also calumniates Thrasymachus of Chalcedon,
                  saying that he was a sophist in a way consistent with his name.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρασύμαχος,</foreign> an audacious disputant; a name

                  Hippias, and Gorgias, and Parmenides; and in one dialogue, called Protagoras, he
                  attacks a great many;—a man who in his Republic has said, <quote>When, as I think,
                     a city which has been governed by a democracy, feels a thirst far liberty, and
                     meets with bad cupbearers, and so it gets intoxicated by too untempered a

               <p>And it is said also, that Gorgias himself, when he read the dialogue to which
                  Plato has given his name, said to his friends, <quote>How well Plato knows how to
                     write iambics!</quote> And Hermippus, in his book on Gorgias, says,—<quote>When
                     Gorgias was sojourning at Athens, after he had offered up at Delphi the golden
                     image of himself which is there now, and when Plato said when he had seen it,
                     The beautiful and golden Gorgias is come among us, Gorgias replied, This is
                     indeed a fine young Archilochus whom Athens has now brought forth.</quote> But
                  others say that Gorgias, having read the dialogue of Plato, said to the bystanders
                  that he had never said any of the things there attributed to him, and had never
                  heard any such things said by Plato. And they say that Phædo also said the same
                  when he had read the treatise on the Soul, on which account it was well said by
                  Timon, respecting him,— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     </l>
                  </quote> For their respective ages will scarcely admit of the Socrates of Plato
                  ever having really had a conference with Parmenides, so as to have addressed him
                  and to have been addressed by him in such language. And what is worst of all is,
                  that he has said, though there was not the slightest occasion for making any such
                  assertion, that Zeno had been beloved by Parmenides, who was his fellow-citizen.
                  Nor, indeed, is it possible that Phædrus should have lived in the time of
                  Socrates, much less that he should have been beloved by him. Nor, again, is it
                  possible that Paralus and Xanthippus, the sons of Pericles, who died of the
                  plague, should have conversed with Protagoras when he came the second time to <pb n="v.2.p.810"/> Athens, as they had died before. And we might mention many
                  other particulars respecting his works to show how wholly fictitious his Dialogues
                  are.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="114">
               <p>But that Plato was ill-natured to everybody is plain from what he says in his
                  dialogue entitled Ion; in which first of all he abuses all the poets, and then all
                  those who have been promoted to the highest dignities by the people, such as
                  Phanosthenes of Andros, and Apollodorus of Cyzicus, and also Heraclides of
                  Clazomenæ. And in his Menon he abuses those who have been the greatest men among
                  the Athenians—Aristides and Themistocles; and he extols Meno, who betrayed the
                  Greeks. But in his Euthydemus he attacks this same Meno and his brother
                  Dionysiodorus, and calls them men slow to learn any good thing, and contentious
                  people, reproaching them with their flight from Chios, which was their native
                  place, from which they went and settled in Thurii. And, in his essay on Manly
                  Courage, he attacks Melesias, the son of that Thucydides who headed the opposite
                  party to Pericles, and Lysimachus, the son of Aristides the Just, saying that they
                  both fell far short of their fathers' virtues. And as to what he said about
                  Alcibiades, in his Banquet, that is not fit to be produced to light; nor is what
                  he says in the first of the Dialogues which go by his name. For the second
                  Alcibiades is said by some people to be the work of Xenophon; as also the Halcyon
                  is said to be the work of Leon the Academician, as Nicias of Nicæa says. Now, the
                  things which he has said against Alcibiades I will pass over; but I cannot forbear
                  to mention his calling the Athenian people a random judge, guided only by outward
                  appearance. And he praises the Lacedæmonians, and extols also the Persians, who
                  are the enemies of all the Greeks.</p>
               <p>And he calls Cleinias the brother of Alcibiades a madman; and the sons of Pericles
                  he makes out to be fools; and Meidias he calls a man fit for nothing but killing
                  quails; and of the people of the Athenians he says, that it wears a fair mask, but
                  that one ought to strip the mask off, and look at it then; for he says that it
                  will then be seen that it is only clothed with a specious appearance of a beauty
                  which is not genuine.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="115">
               <p>But in the Cimon he does not abstain from accusing Themistocles, and Alcibiades,
                  and Myronides, and even Cimon himself; and his Crito contains an invective against
                  Sopho- <pb n="v.2.p.811"/> cles; and his Gorgias contains an invective not only
                  against the man from whom it is named, but also against Archelaus, king of
                  Macedon, whom he reproaches not only with his ignoble birth, but also with having
                  killed his master. And this is the very same Plato whom Speusippus represents as
                  having, while he professed to be a great friend of Archelaus assisted Philip to
                  get possession of the kingdom. At all events, Carystius of Pergamus, in his
                  Historical Commentaries, writes as follows:—<quote>Speusippus, hearing that Philip
                     used calumnious language respecting Plato, wrote something of this sort in his
                     letter to him: 'Just as if men did not know that Philip originally obtained the
                     kingdom by the assistance of Plato.' For Plato sent Euphræus of Oreum to
                     Perdiccas, who persuaded him to apportion a certain district to Philip; and so
                     he, maintaining a force in that country, when Perdiccas died, having all his
                     forces in a state of preparation, seized the supreme power.</quote> But whether
                  all this is true or not, God knows.</p>
               <p>But his fine Protagoras, besides that it contains attacks on many poets and wise
                  men, also shows up the life of Callias with much greater severity than Eupolis
                  does in his flatterers. And in his Menexenus, not only is Hippias the Elean turned
                  into ridicule, but also Antipho the Rhamnusian, and Lamprus the musician. And the
                  day would fail me, if I were inclined to go through the names of all those who
                  have been abused by that wise man. Nor indeed do I praise Antisthenes; for he,
                  having abused many men, did not abstain even from Plato himself, but, having given
                  him the odious name of Sathon, he then published a dialogue under this name.</p>

               <p>But Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, speaking about the universal
                  ill-nature of Plato towards everybody, writes as follows:—<quote>After the death
                     of Socrates, when a great many of his friends, being present at a banquet, were
                     very much out of spirits, Plato, being present, taking the cup, exhorted them
                     not to despond, as he himself was well able to lead the school; and, so saying,
                     he pledged Apollodorus: and he said, I would rather have taken the cup of
                     poison from Socrates than that pledge of wine from you.' For Plato was
                     considered to be an envious man, and to have a disposition which was far from
                     praiseworthy; for he <pb n="v.2.p.812"/> ridiculed Aristippus when he went to
                     visit Dionysius, though he himself had three times sailed to Sicily,—once for
                     the purpose of investigating the torrents of lava which flow from Mount Aetna,
                     when he lived with the elder Dionysius, and was in danger from his displeasure;
                     and twice he went to visit the younger Dionysius.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>And again, though Aeschines was a poor man, and had but one pupil, Xenocrates, he
                  seduced him from him; and he was also detected in instigating the commencement of
                  a prosecution against Phædo, which, if successful, would have reduced him to
                  slavery; and altogether he displayed the feelings of a stepmother towards all the
                  pupils of Socrates. On which account, Socrates, making a not very unreasonable
                  Conjecture respecting him, said in the presence of several persons that he had had
                  a dream, in which he thought he had seen the following vision. <quote>For I
                     thought,</quote> said he, <quote>that Plato had become a crow, and leaped on my
                     head, and began to scratch my bald place, and to take a firm hold, and so to
                     look about him. I think, therefore,</quote> said he, <quote>that you, O Plato,
                     will say a good many things which are false about my head.</quote> And Plato,
                  besides his ill-nature, was very ambitious and vainglorious; and he said,
                     <quote>My last tunic, my desire of glory, I lay aside in death itself—in my
                     will, and in my funeral procession, and in my burial;</quote> as Dioscorides
                  relates in his Memorabilia. And as for his desire of founding cities and making
                  laws, who will not say that these are very ambitious feelings? And this is plain
                  from what he says in the Timæus—<quote>I have the same feelings towards my
                     constitution that a painter would have towards his works; for as he would wish
                     to see them possessed of the power of motion and action, so too do I wish to
                     see the citizens whom I here describe.</quote>

            <div type="chapter" n="117">
               <p>But concerning the things which he has said in his Dialogues, what can any one
                  say? For the doctrine respecting the soul, which he makes out to be immortal, even
                  after it is separated from the body, and after the dissolution of this latter, was
                  first mentioned by Homer; for he has said, that the soul of Patroclus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Fled to the shades below,</l>
                     <l>Lamenting its untimely fate, and leaving</l>
                     <l>Its vigour and its youth.</l>
                  </quote> If, then, any one were to say that this is also the argument of <pb n="v.2.p.813"/> Plato, still I do not see what good we have got from him; for
                  if any one were to agree that the souls of those who are dead do migrate into
                  other natures, and do mount up to some higher and purer district, as partaking of
                  its lightness, still what should we get by that theory? For, as we have neither
                  any recollection of where we formerly were, nor any perception whether we really
                  existed at all, what do we get by such an immortality as that?</p>
               <p>And as to the book of the Laws composed by him, and the Polity which was written
                  before the Laws, what good have they done us? And yet he ought (as Lycurgus did
                  the Lacedæmonians, and as Solon did the Athenians, and Zaleucus the Thurians), if
                  they were excellent, to have persuaded some of the Greeks to adopt them. For a law
                  (as Aristotle says) is a form of words decided on by the common agreement of a
                  city, pointing out how one ought to do everything. And how can we consider Plato's
                  conduct anything but ridiculous; since, when there were already three Athenian
                  lawgivers who had a great name,—Draco, and Plato himself, and Solon,—the citizens
                  abide by the laws of the other two, but ridicule those of Plato? And the case of
                  the Polity is the same. Even if his Constitution is the best of all possible
                  constitutions, yet, if it does not persuade us to adopt it, what are we the better
                  for it? Plato, then, appears to have written his laws, not for men who have any
                  real existence, but rather for a set of men invented by himself; so that one has
                  to look for people who will use them. But it would have been better for him to
                  write such things as he could persuade men of; and not to act like people who only
                  pray, but rather like those who seize hold of what offers itself to them.</p>

               <p>However, to say no more on this point, if any one were to go through his Timæus
                  and his Gorgias, and his other dialogues of the same character, in which he
                  discuss the different subjects of education, and subjects of natural philosophy,
                  and several other circumstances,—even when considered in this light, he is not to
                  be admired on this account; for one may find these same topics handled by others,
                  either better than by him, or at all events not worse. For Theopompus the Chian,
                  in his book Against the School of Plato, says— <quote>We shall find the greater
                     part of his Dialogues useless and false, and a still greater number borrowed
                     from other people; <pb n="v.2.p.814"/> as some of them come from the school of
                     Aristippus, and some from that of Antisthenes, and a great many from that of
                     Bryson of Heraclea.</quote> And as to the disquisitions which he enters into
                  about man, we also seek in his arguments for what we do not find. But what we do
                  find are banquets, and conversations about love, and other very unseemly
                  harangues, which he composed with great contempt for those who were to read them,
                  as the greater part of his pupils were of a tyrannical and calumnious
                  disposition.</p>

               <p>For Euphræus, when he was sojourning with king Perdiccas in Macedonia, was not
                  less a king than the other, being a man of a depraved and calumnious disposition,
                  who managed all the companionship of the king in so cold a manner, that no one was
                  allowed to partake of his entertainments unless he knew something about geometry
                  or philosophy; on which account, after Philip obtained the government, Parmenio,
                  having caught him in Oreum, put him to death; as Carystius relates in his
                  Historical Com- mentaries. And Callippus the Athenian, who was himself a pupil of
                  Plato, having been a companion and fellow-pupil of Dion, and having travelled with
                  him to Syracuse, when he saw that Dion was attempting to make himself master of
                  the kingdom, slew him; and afterwards, attempting to usurp the supreme power
                  himself, was slain too. And Euagon of Lampsacus (as Eurypylus says, and Dicæocles
                  of Cnidus, in the ninety-first book of his Commentaries, and also Demochares the
                  orator, in his argument in defence of Sophocles, against Philo), having lent his
                  native city money on the security of its Acropolis, and being afterwards unable to
                  recover it, endeavoured to seize on the tyranny, until the Lampsacenes attacked
                  him, and repaid him the money, and drove him out of the city. And Timæus of
                  Cyzicus (as the same Demochares relates), having given largesses of money and corn
                  to his fellow-citizens, and being on this account believed by the Cyzicenes to be
                  an excellent man, after having waited a little time, attempted to overturn the
                  constitution with the assistance of Aridæus; and being brought to trial and
                  convicted, and branded with infamy, he remained in the city to an extreme old age,
                  being always, however, considered dishonoured and infamous.</p>

                  Pellene, who was not only a pupil of Plato, but of Xenocrates also. And he too,
                  having usurped the supreme power in his country, and having exercised it with
                  great severity, not only banished the most virtuous men in the city, but also gave

               <p>For enjoyment is connected, in the first instance, with appetite; and in the
                  second place, with pleasure. And Sophocles the poet, being a man fond of
                  enjoyment, in order to avoid accusing old age, attributed his impotence in amatory
                  pleasures to his temperance, saying that he was glad to be released from them as
                  from some hard master. But I say that the Judgment of Paris is a tale originally
                  invented by the 'ancients, as a comparison between pleasure and virtue.
                  Accordingly, when Venus, that is to say pleasure, was preferred, everything was
                  thrown into confusion. And that excellent writer Xenophon seems to me to have
                  invented his fable about Hercules and Virtue on the same principle. For according
                  to Empedocles— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Mars was no god to them, nor gallant War,</l>
                     <l>Nor Jupiter the king, nor Saturn old,</l>
                     <l>Nor Neptune; Venus was their only queen.</l>
                     <l>Her they propitiate and duly worship</l>
                     <l>With pious images, with beauteous figures</l>
                     <l>Skilfully carved; with fragrant incenses,</l>
                     <l>And holy offerings of unmix'd myrrh,</l>

               <p>And yet some people say that the desire of pleasure is a natural desire, as may be
                  proved by all animals becoming enslaved by it; as if cowardice, and fear, and all
                  sorts of other passions were not also common to all animals, and yet these are
                  rejected by all who use their reason. Accordingly, to be very eager in the pursuit
                  of pleasure is to go hunting for pain. On which account Homer, wishing to
                  represent pleasure in an odious light, says that the greatest of the gods receive
                  no advantage from their power, but are even much injured by it, if they will allow
                  themselves to be hurried away by the pursuit of pleasure. For all the anxiety
                  which Jupiter, when awake, lavished on the Trojans, was lost in open day, when he
                  abandoned himself to pleasure. And Mars, who was a most valiant deity, was put in
                  chains by Vulcan, who was very powerless, and incurred great disgrace and
                  punishment, when he had given himself up to irrational love; and therefore he says
                  to the Gods, when they came to see him in fetters— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Behold, on wrong</l>

                     <l>Dwells there a god on all th' Olympian brow</l>
                     <l>More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow?</l>
                     <l>Yet Vulcan conquers, and the God of arms</l>
                     <l>Must pay the penalty for lawless charms.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">This is a blunder of Athenæus. Mars does not say this but

                  present time; and naturally enough. For the lives of those men were destitute of
                  any luxurious preparation, and, as I might almost say, had no seasoning to them,
                  inasmuch as at that time there was no commercial intercourse between nations, nor
                  were the arts of refinement carried to any degree of accuracy; but the life of men
                  of the present day is planned with entire reference to laziness, and enjoyment,
                  and to all sorts of pastimes.</p>

               <p>But Plato, in his Philebus, says—<quote>Pleasure is the most insolent of all
                     things; and, as it is reported, in amatory enjoyments, which are said to be the
                     most powerful of all, even perjury has been pardoned by the Gods, as if
                     pleasure was like a child, incapable of distinguishing between right and
                     wrong.</quote> And in the eighth book of his Polity, the same Plato has
                  previously dilated upon the doctrine so much pressed by the Epicureans, that, of
                  the desires, some are natural but not necessary, and others neither natural nor
                  necessary, writing thus—<quote>Is not the desire to eat enough for health and
                     strength of body, and for bread and meat to that extent, a necessary desire?—I
                     think it is.—At all events, the desire for food for these two purposes is
                     necessary, inasmuch as it is salutary, and inasmuch as it is able to remove
                     hunger? —No doubt.—And the desire for meat, too, is a necessary desire, if it
                     at all contributes to a good habit of body?— Most undoubtedly.—What, then, are
                     we to say? Is no desire which goes beyond the appetite for this kind of food,
                     and for other food similar to it, and which, if it is checked in young people,
                     can be entirely stifled, and which is injurious also to the body, and injurious
                     also to the mind, both as far as its intellectual powers are concerned, and
                     also as to its temperance, entitled to be called a necessary one?—Most

            <div type="chapter" n="5">
               <p>But Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, speaks as follows—“Tyrants
                  and kings, having all kinds of good things in their power, and having had
                  experience of all things, place pleasure in the first rank, on the ground that
                  pleasure makes the nature of man more magnanimous. Accordingly, all those who have
                  honoured pleasure above everything, and who have deliberately chosen to live a
                  life of luxury, have been magnanimous and magnificent people, as, <pb n="v.3.p.821"/> for instance, the Medes and the Persians. For they, of all
                  men, are those who hold pleasure and luxury in the highest honour; and they, at
                  the same time, are the most valiant and magnanimous of all the barbarians. For to
                  indulge in pleasure and luxury is the conduct of freeborn men and of a liberal
                  disposition. For pleasure relaxes the soul and invigorates it. But labour belongs
                  to slaves and to mean men; on which account they are contracted in their natural
                  dispositions. And the city of the Athenians, while it indulged in luxury, was a
                  very great city, and bred very magnanimous men. For they wore purple garments, and
                  were clad in embroidered tunics; and they bound up their hair in knots, and wore
                  golden grasshoppers over their foreheads and in their hair: and their slaves
                  followed them, bearing folding chairs for them, in order that, if they wished to
                  sit down, they might not be without some proper seat, and forced to put up with
                  any chance seat. And these men were such heroes, that they conquered in the battle
                  of Marathon, and they alone worsted the power of combined Asia. And all those who
                  are the wisest of men, and who have the greatest reputation for wisdom, think
                  pleasure the greatest good, Simonides certainly does when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For what kind of human life</l>
                     <l>Can be worth desiring,</l>
                     <l>If pleasure be denied to it?</l>
                     <l>What kingly power even?</l>
                     <l>Without pleasure e'en the gods</l>
                     <l>Have nothing to be envied for.</l>
                  </quote> And Pindar, giving advice to Hiero the tyrant of Syracuse, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Never obscure fair pleasure in your life;</l>
                     <l>A life of pleasure is the best for man.</l>
                  </quote> And Homer, too, speaks of pleasure and indulgence in the following terms—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">

                  that the custom has originated among men of leaving nothing in the cup when we
                  pour a libation to Hercules, if he had no regard for pleasure? or why are the hot
                  springs which rise out of the ground universally said to be sacred to Hercules; or
                  why are people in the habit of calling soft couches the beds of Hercules, if he
                  despised all those who live luxuriously? Accordingly, says he, the later poets
                  represent him as going about in the guise of a robber by himself, having a club,
                  and a lion's hide, and his bow. And they say that Stesichorus of Himera was the
                  original inventor of this fable. But Xanthus the lyric poet, who was more ancient
                  than Stesichorus, as Stesichorus himself tells us, does not, according to the
                  statement of Megaclides, clothe him in this dress, but in that which Homer gives
                  him. But Stesichorus perverted a great many of the accounts given by Xanthus, as
                  he does also in the case of what is called the Orestea. But Antisthenes, when he
                  said that pleasure was a good, added—<quote>such as brought no repentance in its
                     train.</quote>

                  for the sake of appearing to be of the same disposition as the Phæacians; and that
                  with that view he embraces their luxurious habits, as he had already heard from
                  Alcinous, speaking of his whole nation— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> for he thought that that would be the only way by which he could avoid
                  failing in the hopes he cherished. And a similar man is he who recommends

                  </quote> And some say that Homer was of this mind, when he often prefers the

                  </quote> And the same poet represents Menelaus as saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>From me so loving and so glad a heart.</l>

               <p>But of all nations the Persians were the first to become notorious for their
                  luxury; and the Persian kings even spent their winters at Susa and their summers
                  at Ecbatana. And <pb n="v.3.p.824"/> Aristocles and Chares say that Susa derives
                  its name from the seasonable and beautiful character of the place: for that what
                  the Greeks call the lily, is called in the Persian language <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοῦσον.</foreign> But they pass their autumns in Persepolis; and the rest of
                  the year they spend in Babylon. And in like manner the kings of the Parthians
                  spend their spring in Rhagæ, and their winter in Babylon, and the rest of the year
                  at Hecatompylus. And even the very thing which the Persian monarchs used to wear
                  on their heads, showed plainly enough their extreme devotion to luxury. For it was
                  made, according to the account of Dinon, of myrrh and of something called labyzus.
                  And the labyzus is a sweet-smelling plant, and more valuable than myrrh. And
                  whenever, says Dinon, the king dismounts from his chariot, he does not jump down,
                  however small the height from the chariot to the ground may be, nor is he helped
                  down, leaning on any one's hand, but a golden chair is always put by him, and he
                  gets on that to descend; on which account the king's chairbearer always follows
                  him. And three hundred women are his guard, as Heraclides of Cumæ relates, in the
                  first book of his history of Persia. And they sleep all day, that they may watch
                  all night; and they pass the whole night in singing and playing, with lights
                  burning. And very often the king takes pleasure with them in the hall of the
                  Melophori. The Melophori are one of his troops of guards, all Persians by birth,
                  having golden apples (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μῆλα</foreign>) on the points of their
                  spears, a thousand in number, all picked men out of the main body of ten thousand
                  Persians who are called the Immortals. And the king used to go on foot through
                  this hall, very fine Sardian carpets being spread in his road, on which no one but
                  the king ever trod. And when he came to the last hall, then he mounted a chariot,
                  but sometimes he mounted a horse; but on foot he was never seen outside of his
                  palace. And if he went out to hunt, his concubines also went with him. And the
                  throne on which he used to sit, when he was transacting business, was made of
                  gold; and it was surrounded by four small pillars made of gold, inlaid with
                  precious stones, and on them there was spread a purple cloth richly
                  embroidered.</p>

                  this account they made eunuchs of many citizens of the neighbouring tribes, adds,
                     <quote>that the institution of the Melophori was adopted by the Persians from
                     the Medes, being not only a revenge for what they had suffered themselves, but
                     also a memorial of the luxury of the bodyguards, to indicate to what pitch of
                     effeminacy they had come. For, as it seems, the unseasonable and superfluous
                     luxury of their daily life could make even the men who are armed with spears,
                     mere mountebanks.</quote> And a little further on he says—<quote>And

                     allow the food which they had invented to be set before them, but enjoyed it
                     all by himself, and thought this was the greatest wisdom. For this, I imagine,
                     is what is called the brains of Jupiter and of a king at the same time.</quote>

               <p>But Chares of Mitylene, in the fifth book of his History of Alexander,
                     says—<quote>The Persian kings had come to such a pitch of luxury, that at the
                     head of the royal couch there was a supper-room laid with five couches, in
                     which there were always kept five thousand talents of gold; and this was called
                     the king's pillow. And at his feet was another supper-room, prepared with three
                     couches, in which there were constantly kept three thousand talents of silver;
                     and this was called the king's footstool. And in his bed-chamber there was also
                     a golden vine, inlaid with precious stones, above the king's bed.</quote> And
                  this vine, Amyntas says in his Posts, had bunches of grapes, composed of most
                  valuable precious stones; and not far from it there was placed a golden bowl, the
                  work of Theodorus of Samos. And Agathocles, in the third book of his History of
                  Cyzicus, says, that there is also among the Persians a water called the golden
                  water, and that it rises in seventy springs; and that no one ever drinks of it but
                  the king alone, and the eldest of his sons. And if any one else drinks of it, the
                  punishment is death.</p>

               <p>But Xenophon, in the eighth book of his Cyropædia, says—<quote>They still used at
                     that time to practise the discipline of the Persians, but the dress and
                     effeminacy of the Medes. But now they disregard the sight of the ancient
                     Persian bravery becoming extinct, and they are solicitous only to preserve the
                     effeminacy of the Medes. And I think it a <pb n="v.3.p.826"/> good opportunity
                     to give an account of their luxurious habits. For, in the first place, it is
                     not enough for them to have their beds softly spread, but they put even the
                     feet of their couches upon carpets in order that the floor may not present
                     resistance to them, but that the carpets may yield to their pressure. And as
                     for the things which are dressed for their table, nothing is omitted which has
                     been discovered before, and they are also continually inventing something new;
                     and the same is the way with all other delicacies. For they retain men whose
                     sole business it is to invent things of this kind. And in winter it is not
                     enough for them to have their head, and their body, and their feet covered, but
                     on even the tips of their fingers they wear shaggy gloves and finger-stalls;
                     and in summer they are not satisfied with the shade of the trees and of the
                     rocks, but they also have men placed in them to contrive additional means of
                     producing shade.</quote> And in the passage which follows this one, he proceeds
                  to say—<quote>But now they have more clothes laid upon their horses than they have
                     even on their beds. For they do not pay so much attention to their horsemanship
                     as to sitting softly. Moreover, they have porters, and bread-makers, and
                     confectioners, and cup-bearers, and men to serve up their meals and to take
                     them away, and men to lull them to sleep and men to wake them, and dressers to
                     anoint them and to rub them, and to get them up well in every respect.</quote>

               <p>The Lydians, too, went to such a pitch of luxury, that they were the first to
                  castrate women, as Xanthus the Lydian tells us, or whoever else it was who wrote
                  the History which is attributed to him, whom Artemon of Cassandra, in his treatise
                  on the Collection of Books, states to have been Pionysius who was surnamed
                  Leather-armed; but Artemon was not aware that Ephorus the historian mentions him
                  as being an older man than the other, and as having been the man who supplied
                  Herodotus with some of his materials. Xanthus, then, in the second book of his
                  Affairs of Lydia, says that Adramyttes, the king of the Lydians, was the first man
                  who ever castrated women, and used female eunuchs instead of male eunuchs. But
                  Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, says—“The Lydians, out of luxury, made
                  parks; and having planted them like gardens, made them very shady, thinking it a
                  refinement in luxury if the sun never touched them with its rays at all; and at
                  last they carried <pb n="v.3.p.827"/> their insolence to such a height, that they
                  used to collect other men's wives and maidens into a place that, from this
                  conduct, got the name of Hagneon, and there ravished them. And at last, having
                  become utterly effeminate, they lived wholly like women instead of like men; on
                  which account their age produced even a female tyrant, in the person of one of
                  those who had been ravished in this way, by name Omphale. And she was the first to
                  inflict on the Lydians the punishment that they deserved. For to be governed and
                  insulted by a woman is a sufficient proof of the severity with which they were
                  treated. Accordingly she, being a very intemperate woman herself, and meaning to
                  revenge the insults to which she herself had been subjected, gave the maiden
                  daughters of the masters to their slaves, in the very same place in which she
                  herself had been ravished. And then having forcibly collected them all in this
                  place, she shut up the mistresses with their slaves.</p>
               <p>On which account the Lydians, wishing to soften the bitterness of the transaction,
                  call the place the Woman's Contest —the Sweet Embrace. And not only were the wives
                  of the Lydians exposed to all comers, but those also of the Epizephyrian Locrians,
                  and also those of the Cyprians—and, in fact, those of all the nations who devote
                  their daughters to the lives of prostitutes; and it appears to be, in truth, a
                  sort of reminding of, and revenge for, some ancient insult. So against her a
                  Lydian man of noble birth rose up, one who had been previously offended at the
                  government of Midas; while Midas lay in effeminacy, and luxury, and a purple robe,
                  working in the company of the women at the loom. But as Omphale slew all the
                  strangers whom she admitted to her embraces, he chastised both-the one, being a
                  stupid and illiterate man, he dragged out by his ears; a man who, for want of
                  sense, had the surname of the most stupid of all animals: but the woman . . . .

               <p>And the Lydians were also the first people to introduce the use of the sauce
                  called caruca; concerning the preparation of which all those who have written
                  cookery books have spoken a good deal-namely, Glaucus the Locrian, and Mithæcus,
                  and Dionysius, and the two Heraclidæ (who were by birth Syracusans), and Agis, and

                  wholly devoted were they to luxury. And Hegesippus the Tarentine says, that the
                  candaulus is made of boiled meat, and grated bread, and Phrygian cheese, and
                  aniseed, and thick broth: and it is mentioned by Alexis, in his Woman Working all

               <p>But Heraclides of Cumæ, who wrote the History of Persia, having said in his book
                  entitled The Preparation, that in the country which produces frankincense the king
                  is independent, and responsible to no one, proceeds as follows:— <quote>And he
                     exceeds every one in luxury and indolence; for he stays for ever in his palace,
                     passing his whole life in luxury and extravagance; and he does no single thing,
                     nor does he see many people. But he appoints the judges, and if any one thinks
                     that they have decided unjustly, there is a window in the highest part of the
                     palace, and it is fastened with a chain: accordingly, he who thinks that an
                     unjust decision has been given against him, takes hold of the chain, and drags
                     the window; and when the king hears it, he summons the man, and hears the cause
                     himself. And if the judges appear to have decided unjustly, they are put to
                     death; but if they appear to have decided justly, then the man who has moved
                     the window is put to death.</quote> And it is said that the sum expended every
                  day on the king, and on his wives and friends, amounts to fifteen Babylonian
                  talents.</p>

               <p>And among the Tyrrhenians, who carry their luxury to an extraordinary pitch,
                  Timæus, in his first book, relates that the female servants wait on the men in a
                  state of nudity. And Theopompus, in the forty-third book of his History, states,
                     <quote>that it is a law among the Tyrrhenians that all their women should be in
                     common: and that the women pay the greatest attention to their persons, and
                     often practise gymnastic exercises, naked, among the men, and sometimes with
                     one another; for that it is not accounted shameful for them to be seen naked.
                     And that they sup not with their own husbands, but with any one who happens to
                     be present; and they pledge whoever they please in their cups: and that they
                     are wonderful women to drink, and very and some. And that the Tyrrhenians bring
                     up all the children that are born, no one knowing to what father each child
                     belongs: and the children, too, live in the same manner as those who have
                     brought them up, having feasts very frequently, ad being intimate with all the
                     women. Nor is it reckoned among the Tyrrhenians at all disgraceful either to do
                     or suffer anything <pb n="v.3.p.830"/> in the open air, or to be seen while it
                     is going on; for it is quite the custom of their country: and they are so far
                     from thinking it disgraceful, that they even say, when the master of the house
                     is indulging his appetites, and any one asks for him, that he is doing so and
                     so, using the coarsest possible words for his occupation. But when they are
                     together in parties of companions or relations, they act in the following
                     manner. First of all, when they have stopped drinking, and are about to go to
                     sleep, while the lights are still burning, the servants introduce sometimes
                     courtesans, and sometimes beautiful boys, and sometimes women; and when they
                     have enjoyed them, they proceed to acts of still grosser licentiousness: and
                     they indulge their appetites, and make parties on purpose, sometimes keeping
                     one another in sight, but more frequently making tents around the beds, which
                     are made of plaited laths, with cloths thrown over them. And the objects of
                     their love are usually women; still they are not invariably as particular as
                     they might be; and they are very beautiful, as is natural for people to be who
                     live delicately, and who take great care of their persons.</quote>

               <p>And all the barbarians who live towards the west, smooth their bodies by rubbing
                  them with pitch, and by shaving them; and among the Tyrrhenians there are many
                  shops in which this trade is practised, and many artists whose sole employment it
                  is, just as there are barbers among us. And when the Tyrrhenians go to these men,
                  they give themselves wholly up to them, not being ashamed of having spectators, or
                  of those who may be passing by. And many of the Greeks, and of those who inhabit
                  Italy, adopt this practice, having learnt it from the Samnites and Messapians. But
                  the Tyrrhenians (as Alcimus relates) are so far gone in luxury, that they even
                  make bread, and box, and flog people to the sound of the flute.</p>

                  fast, and to prevent also their scalding the bathers in their haste? And the <pb n="v.3.p.831"/> Sybarites were the first people to forbid those who practise
                  noisy arts from dwelling in their city; such as braziers, and smiths, and
                  carpenters, and men of similar trades; providing that their slumbers should always

               <p>And Timæus relates concerning them, that a citizen of Sybaris once going into the
                  country, seeing the husbandmen digging, said that he himself felt as if he had
                  broker his bones by the sight; and some one who heard him replied, <quote>I, when
                     I heard you say this, felt as if I had a pain in my side.</quote> And once, at
                  Crotona, some Sybarites were standing by some one of the athletes who was digging
                  up dust for the palæstra, and said they marvelled that men who had such a city had
                  no slaves to dig the palæstra for them. But another Sybarite, coming to Lacedæmon,
                  and being invited to the phiditium, sitting down on a wooden seat and eating with
                  them, said that originally he had been surprised at hearing of the valour of the
                  Lacedæmonians; but that now that he had seen it, he thought that they in no
                  respect surpassed other men: for that the greatest coward on earth would rather
                  die a thousand times than live and endure such a life as theirs.</p>

                  are ranked among the ephebi, should wear purple robes, and curls braided with
                  gold. And it is a custom with them also to breed up in their houses little
                  mannikins and dwarfs (as Timon says) who are called by some people <foreign xml:lang="grc">στίλπωνες;</foreign> and also little Maltese dogs, which follow
                  them even to the gymnasia. And it was these men, and men like them, to whom

               <p>The Sybarites used to wear also garments made of Milesian wool, from which there
                  arose a great friendship between the two cities, as Timæus relates. For of the
                  inhabitants of Italy, the Milesians gave the preference to the Tyrrhenians, and of
                  foreigners to the Ionians, because they were devoted to luxury. But the cavalry of
                  the Sybarites, being in number more than five thousand, used to go in procession
                  with saffron-coloured robes over their breastplates; and in the summer their
                  younger men used to go away to the caves of the Lusiades Nymphs, and live there in
                  all kinds of luxury. And whenever the rich men of that country left the city for
                  the country, although they always travelled in chariots, still they used to
                  consume three days in a day's journey. And some of the roads which led to their
                  villas in the country were covered with awnings all over; and a great many of them
                  had cellars near the sea, into which their wine was brought by canals from the
                  country, and some of it was then sold out of the district, but some was brought
                  into the city in boats. They also celebrate in public numbers of feasts; and they
                  honour those who display great magnificence on such occasions with golden crowns,
                  and they proclaim their names at the public sacrifices and games; announcing not
                  only their general goodwill towards the city, but also the great magnificence
                  which they had displayed in the feasts. And on these occasions they even crown
                  those cooks who have served up the most exquisite dishes. And among the Sybarites
                  there were found baths in which, while they lay down, they were steamed with warm
                  vapours. And they were the first people who introduced the custom of bringing
                  chamber-pots into entertainments. But laughing at those who left their countries
                  to travel in foreign lands, they themselves used to boast that they had grown old
                  without ever having crossed the bridges which led over their frontier rivers.</p>

               <p>But it seems to me, that besides the fact of the riches of the Sybarites, the very
                  natural character of their country,— since there are no harbours on their coasts,
                  and since, in consequence, nearly all the produce of the land is consumed by the
                  citizens themselves,—and to some extent also an oracle of the God, has excited
                  them all to luxury, and has cased them to live in practices of most immoderate
                  dissoluteness. But their city lies in a hollow, and in summer is liable to excess
                  of cold both morning and evening, but in the middle of the day the heat is
                  intolerable, so that the greater part of them believe that the rivers contribute a
                  great deal to the health of the inhabitants; on which account it has been said,
                  that <quote>an man who, living at Sybaris, wishes not to die before his time,
                     ought never to see the sun either rise or set.</quote> And once they sent to
                  the oracle to consult the God (and one of the ambassadors was named Amyris), and
                  to ask how long their prosperity should last; and the priestess of Delphi answered
                  them— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You shall be happy, Sybarite,—very happy,</l>
                     <l>And all your time in entertainments pass,</l>
                     <l>While you continue to th' immortal gods</l>
                     <l>The worship due: but when you come, at length,</l>
                     <l>To honour mortal man beyond the gods,</l>
                     <l>Then foreign war and intestine sedition</l>
                     <l>Shall come upon you, and shall crush your city.</l>
                  </quote> When they had heard this they thought the God had said to them that they
                  should never have their luxury terminated; for that there was no chance of their
                  ever honouring a man more than God. But in agreement with the oracle they
                  experienced a change of fortune, when one of them flogging one of his slaves,
                  continued to beat him after he had sought an asylum in a temple; but when at last
                  he fled to the tomb of his father, he let him go, out of shame. But their whole
                  revenues were dissipated by the way in which then rivalled one another in luxury.
                  And the city also rivalled all other cities in luxury. And not long after this
                  circumstance, when many omens of impending destruction, which it is not necessary
                  to allude to further at present, had given them notice, they were destroyed.</p>

               <p>But they had carried their luxury to such a pitch that they had taught even their
                  horses to dance at their feasts to the music of the flute. Accordingly the people
                  of Crotona, <pb n="v.3.p.834"/> knowing this, and being at war with them, as
                  Aristotle relates in his History of the Constitution of Sybaris, played before

                  Crotona also had fluteplayers in military uniform. And as soon as the horses heard
                  them playing on the flute, they not only began to dance, but ran over to the army
                  of the Crotonians, carrying their riders with them.</p>
               <p>And Charon of Lampsacus tells a similar story about the Cardians, in the second
                  book of his Annals, writing as follows:—<quote>The Bisaltæ invaded the territory
                     of the Cardians, and conquered them. But the general of the Bisaltæ was Onaris;
                     and he, while he was a boy, had been sold as a slave in Cardia; and having
                     lived as a slave to one of the Cardians, he had been taught the trade of a
                     barber. And the Cardians had an oracle warning them that the Bisaltæ would some
                     day invade them; and they very often used to talk over this oracle while
                     sitting in this barber's shop. And Onaris, escaping from Cardia to his own
                     country, prompted the Bisaltæ to invade the Cardians, and was himself elected
                     general of the Bisaltæ. But all the Cardians had been in the habit of teaching
                     their horses to dance at their feasts to the music of the flute; and they,
                     standing on their hind feet, used to dance with their fore feet in time to the
                     airs which they had been taught. Onaris then, knowing these things, got a

                     to the Bisaltæ, taught many of their fluteplayers; and when they had learnt
                     sufficiently, he took them in his army against the Cardians. And when the
                     battle took place, he ordered the fluteplayers to play the airs which they had
                     learnt, and which the horses of the Cardians knew. And when the horses heard
                     the flute, they stood up on their hind feet, and took to dancing. But the main
                     strength of the Cardians was in their cavalry, and so they were

                  was a law at Syracuse, that the women should not wear golden ornaments, nor
                  garments embroidered with flowers, nor robes with purple borders, unless they
                  professed that they were public prostitutes; and that there was another law, that
                  a man should not adorn his person, nor wear any extraordinarily handsome robes,
                  different from the rest of the citizens, unless he meant to confess that he was.
                  an adulterer and a profligate: and also, that a freewoman was not to walk abroad
                  when the sun had set, unless she was going to commit adultery; and even by day
                  they were not allowed to go out without the leave of the regulators of the women,
                  and without one female servant following them,)— Phylarchus, I say, states, that
                     <quote>the Sybarites, having given loose to their luxury, made a law that women
                     might be invited to banquets, and that those who intended to invite them to
                     sacred festivities must make preparation a year before, in order that they
                     might have all that time to provide themselves with garments and other
                     ornaments in a suitable manner worthy of the occasion, and so might come to the
                     banquet to which they were invited. And if any confectioner or cook invented
                     any peculiar and excellent dish, no other artist was allowed to make this for a
                     year; but he alone who invented it was entitled to all the profit to be derived

                     duced to labour at excelling in such pursuits. And the same way, it was
                     provided that those who sold eels were not to be liable to pay tribute, nor
                     those who caught them either. And in the same way the laws exempted from all

               <p>They, then, having carried their luxury and insolence to a great height, at last,
                  when thirty ambassadors came to them from the people of Crotona, slew them all,
                  and threw <pb n="v.3.p.836"/> their bodies down over the wall, and left them
                  there to be eaten by beasts. And this was the beginning of great evils to them, as
                  the Deity was much offended at it. Accordingly, a few days afterwards all their
                  chief magistrates appeared to see the same vision on one night; for they thought
                  that they saw Juno coming into the midst of the market-place, and vomiting gall;
                  and a spring of blood arose in her temple. But even then they did not desist from
                  their arrogance, until they were all destroyed by the Crotonians. But Heraclides
                  of Pontus, in his treatise on Justice, says,—<quote>The Sybarites having put down
                     the tyranny of Telys, and having destroyed all those who had exercised

                     a fountain of blood, so that they were forced to cover all the place around
                     with brazen tablets, wishing to stop the rising of the blood: on which account
                     they were all driven from their city and destroyed. And they had also been
                     desirous to obscure the glory of the famous games at Olympia; for watching the

               <p>And the men of Crotona, as Timæus says, after they had destroyed the people of
                  Sybaris, began to indulge in luxury; so that their chief magistrate went about the
                  city clad in a purple robe, and wearing a golden crown on his head, and wearing
                  also white sandals. But some say that this was not done out of luxury, but owing
                  to Democedes the physician, who was by birth a native of Crotona; and who having
                  lived with Polycrates the tyrant of Samos, and having been taken prisoner by the
                  Persians after his death, was taken to the king of Persia, after Orœtes had put
                  Polycrates to death. And Democedes, having cured Atossa, the wife of Darius, and
                  daughter of Cyrus, who had a complaint in her breast, asked of her this reward, to
                  be sent back to Greece, on condition of returning again to Persia; and having
                  obtained his request he came to Crotona. And as he wished to remain there, when
                  some Persian laid hold of him and said that he was a slave of the king of Persia,
                  the Crotonians took him away, and having stripped the Persian of his robe, dressed
                  the lictor of their chief magistrate in it. And <pb n="v.3.p.837"/> from that
                  time forward, the lictor, having on the Persian robe, went round with the chief
                  magistrate to all the altars every seventh day; not for the sake of luxury or
                  insolence, but doing it for the purpose of insulting the Persians. But after this
                  the men of Crotona, as Timæus says, attempted to put an end to the Assembly at
                  Olympia, by appointing a meeting for games, with enormously rich prizes, to be
                  held at exactly the same time as the Olympian games; but some say that the

               <p>But Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, says that the people of Tarentum,
                  being a very valiant and powerful people, carried their luxury to such a height,
                  that they used to make their whole body smooth, and that they were the first
                  people who set other nations an example of this smoothness. They also, says he,
                  all wore very beautiful fringes on their garments; such as those with which now
                  the life of woman is refined. And afterwards, being led on by their luxury to
                  insolence, they overthrew a city of the Iapyges, called Carbina, and collected all
                  the boys and maidens, and women in the flower of their age, out of it into the
                  temples of the Carbinians; and building tents there, they exposed them naked by
                  day for all who chose to come and look at them, so that whoever pleased, leaping,
                  as it were, on this unfortunate band, might satiate his appetites with the beauty
                  of those who were there assembled, in the sight of every one, and above all of the
                  Gods, whom they were thinking of but little. And this aroused the indignation of
                  the Deity, so that he struck all the Tarentines who behaved so impiously in
                  Carbina with his thunderbolts. And even to this day at Tarentum every one of the
                  houses has the same number of pillars before its doors as that of the people whom
                  it received back of those who were sent to Iapygia. And, when the day comes which
                  is the anniversary of their death, they do not bewail those who perished at those
                  pillars, nor do they offer the libations which are customary in other cases, but
                  they offer sacrifices to Jupiter the Thunderer.</p>

               <p>Now the race of the Iapygians came originally from Crete, being descended from
                  those Cretans who came to seek for Glaucus, and settled in that part of Italy; but
                  afterwards, they, forgetting the orderly life of the Cretans came to such a pitch
                  of luxury, and from thence to such a degree <pb n="v.3.p.838"/> of insolence,
                  that they were the first people who painted their faces, and who wore headbands
                  and false hair, and who clothed themselves in robes embroidered with flowers, and
                  who considered it disgraceful to cultivate the land, or to do any kind of labour.
                  And most of them made their houses more beautiful than the temples of the gods;
                  and so they say, that the leaders of the Iapygians, treating the Deity with
                  insult, destroyed the images of the gods out of the temples, ordering them to give
                  place to their superiors. On which account, being struck with fire and
                  thunderbolts, they gave rise to this report; for indeed the thunderbolts with
                  which they were stricken down were visible a long time afterwards. And to this
                  very day all their descendants live with shaven heads and in mourning apparel, in

                  hindered by their dress from displaying their vigour in war; but the people of
                  Massilia became very effeminate, wearing the same highly ornamented kind of dress
                  which the Spaniards used to wear; but they behave in a shameless manner, on
                  account of the effeminacy of their souls, behaving like women, out of luxury: from
                  which the proverb has gone about,—May you sail to Massilia. And the inhabitants of
                  Siris, which place was first inhabited by people who touched there on their return
                  from Troy, and after them by the Colophonians, as Timæus and Aristotle tell us,
                  indulged in luxury no less than the Sybarites; for it was a peculiar national
                  custom of theirs to wear embroidered tunics, which they girded up with expensive
                  girdles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίτραι</foreign>); and on this account they were
                  called by the inhabitants of the adjacent countries <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιτροχίτωνες,</foreign> since Homer calls those who have no girdles <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμιτροχίτωνες.</foreign> And Archilochus the poet marvelled beyond
                  anything at the country of the Siritans, and at their prosperity. Accordingly,
                  speaking of Thasos as inferior to Siris, he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  from a woman named Siris, but according to Archilochus, from a river of the same
                  name. And the number of the population was very great in proportion to the size of
                  the place and extent of the country, owing to the luxurious and delicious
                  character of the climate all around. On which account nearly all that part of

                  citizens, not loving equity, destroyed their enemies root and branch. For all the
                  rich men and the populace formed opposite factions (and they call the populace
                  Gergithæ). At first the people got the better, and drove out the rich men, and,
                  collecting the children of those who fled into some threshing-floors, collected a
                  lot of oxen, and so trampled them to death, destroying them in a most impious

                  smeared over all those whom they got into their power with pitch, and so burnt
                  them alive. And when they were being burnt, they say that many other prodigies
                  were seen, and also that a sacred olive took fire of its own accord; on which
                  account the God drove them for a long time from his oracle; and when they asked

               <p>And concerning the Scythians, Clearchus, in what follows these last words,
                  proceeds to say—-"The nation of the Scythians was the first to use common laws;
                  but after that, they became in their turn the most miserable of all nations, on
                  account of their insolence: for they indulged in luxury to a degree in which no
                  other nation did, being prosperous in everything, and having great resources of
                  all sorts for such indulgences. And this is plain from the traces which exist of
                  it to this day in the apparel worn, and way of life practised, by their chief men.
                  For they, being very luxurious, and indeed being the first men who abandoned
                  themselves wholly to luxury, proceeded to such a pitch of insolence that they used
                  to cut off the noses of all the men wherever they came; and their descendants,
                  after they emigrated to other countries, even now derive their name from this
                  treatment. But their wives used to tattoo the wives of the Thracians, (of those
                  Thracians, that is, who lived on the northern and western frontiers of Scythia,)
                  all over their bodies, drawing figures on them with the tongues of their buckles;
                  on which account, many years afterwards, the wives of the Thracians who had been
                  treated in this manner effaced this disgrace in a peculiar manner of their own,
                  tattooing also all the rest of their skin all over, in order that by this means
                  the brand of disgrace and insult which was imprinted on their bodies, being
                  multiplied in so various a manner, might efface the reproach by being called an
                  ornament. And they lorded it over all other nations in so tyrannical a manner,
                  that the offices of slavery, which are painful enough to all men, made it plain to

                     their heads are in like manner embroidered with figures of animals. They wear
                     also garments called sarapes, of yellow, or scarlet, or white, and some even of
                     purple: and they wear also long robes called calasires, of Corinthian
                     workmanship; and some of these are purple, and some violet-coloured, and some
                     hyacinth-coloured; and one may also see some which are of a fiery red, and
                     others which are of a sea-green colour. There are also Persian calasires, which
                     are the most beautiful of all. And one may see also,</quote> continues
                  Democritus, <quote>the garments which they call actææ; and the actæa is the most
                     costly of all the Persian articles of dress: and this actæa is woven for the
                     sake of fineness and of strength, and it is ornamented all over with golden
                     millet-grains; and all the millet-grains have knots of purple thread passing
                     through the middle, to fasten them inside the garment.</quote> And he says that

                  unseemly drunkenness, that some of them never once saw the sun either rise or set:
                  and they passed a law, which continued even to our time, that the female

                  receive pay from daybreak to midday, and until the lamps were lighted; but after

                     constantly sold for its weight in silver. And so, owing to these practices,
                     they fell under the power of tyrants, and became torn by factions, and so were

                     harbour, were very intemperate, and in the constant habit of feasting and
                     drinking at the wine-sellers'. But the Chalcedonians, before they became
                     members of the same city with them, were men who at all times cultivated better
                     habits and principles of life; but after they had tasted of the democracy of
                     the Byzantians, they fell into ruinous luxury, and, from having been most
                     temperate and moderate in their daily life, they became a nation of hard

                     they indulge also in all other such practices as naturally follow on such

                  him, wore golden brocaded garments all day, and robes embroidered with flowers;
                  and used to go to the fields with their wives, riding in chariots.—And this is

               <p>But of individual instances I have heard tile following stories:—Ctesias, in the
                  third book of his History of Persia, says, that all those who were ever kings in
                  Asia devoted themselves mainly to luxury; and above all of them, Ninyas did so,
                  the son of Ninus and Semiramis. He, therefore, remaining in-doors and living
                  luxuriously, was never seen by any one, except by his eunuchs and by his own
                  women.</p>
               <p>And another king of this sort was Sardanapalus, whom some call the son of
                  Anacyndaraxes, and others the son of Anabaxarus. And so, when Arbaces, who was one
                  of the generals under him, a Mede by birth, endeavoured to manage, by the
                  assistance of one of the eunuchs, whose name was Sparamizus, to see Sardanaplus;
                  and when he with difficulty prevailed upon him, with the consent of the king
                  himself,—when the Mede entered and saw him, pointed with vermilion and adorned
                  like a woman, sitting among his concubines carding purple wool, and sitting among
                  them with his feet up, wearing a woman's robe, and with his beard carefully
                  scraped, and his face smoothed with pumice-stone (for he was whiter than milk, and
                  pencilled under his eyes and eyebrows; and when he saw Arbaces, he was just
                  putting a little more white under his eyes), most historians, among whom Duris is
                  one, relate that Arbaces, being indignant at his countrymen being ruled over by
                  such a monarch as that, stabbed him and slew him. But Ctesias says that he went to
                  war with him, and collected a great army, and then that Sardanapalus, being
                  dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself alive in his palace, having heaped up
                  a funeral pile four plethra in extent, on which he placed a hundred and fifty
                  golden couches, and a corresponding number of tables, these, too, being all made
                  of gold. And he also erected on the funeral pile a chamber a hundred feet long,
                  made of wood; and in it he had couches spread, and there he himself lay down with
                  his wife, and his concubines lay on other couches around. For he had sent on his
                  three sons and his daughters, when he saw that his affairs were getting in a
                  dangerous state, to Nineveh, to the king of that city, giving them three thousand
                  talents <pb n="v.3.p.848"/> of gold. And he made the roof of this apartment of
                  large stout beams, and then all the walls of it he made of numerous thick planks,
                  so that it was impossible to escape out of it. And in it he placed ten millions of
                  talents of gold, and a hundred millions of talents of silver, and robes, and
                  purple garments, and every kind of apparel imaginable. And after that he bade the
                  slaves set fire to the pile; and it was fifteen days burning. And those who saw
                  the smoke wondered, and thought that he was celebrating a great sacrifice; but the
                  eunuchs alone knew what was really being done. And in this way Sardanapalus, who
                  had spent his life in extraordinary luxury, died with as much magnanimity as
                  possible.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="39">
               <p>But Clearchus, relating the history of the king of Persia, says that—<quote>in a
                     very prudent manner he proposed prizes for any one who could invent any
                     delicious food. For this is what, I imagine, is meant by the brains of Jupiter
                     and the king. On which account,</quote> continues he, <quote>Sardanapalus was
                     the most happy of all monarchs, who during his whole life preferred enjoyment
                     to everything else, and who, even after his death, shows by his fingers, in the
                     figure carved on his tomb, how much ridicule all human affairs deserve, being
                     not worth the snap of his fingers which he makes . . . . . . . . anxiety about

               <p>However, Sardanapalus does not appear to have lived all his life in entire

                  Nineveh there is a very high mound, which Cyrus levelled with the ground when he
                  besieged the city, and raised another mound against the city; and that this mound
                  was said to have been erected by Sardanapalus the son of King Ninus; and that on
                  it there was said to be inscribed, on a marble pillar and in Chaldaic characters,
                  the following inscription, which Chærilus translated into Greek, and reduced to
                  metre. And the inscription is as follows— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Sardanapalus died of old age after he had lost the sovereignty over the Syrians.
                  And Aristobulus says— "In Anchiale, which was built by Sardanapalus, did
                  Alexander, when he was on his expedition against the Persians, pitch his camp. And
                  at no great distance was the monument of Sardanapalus, on which there was a marble
                  figure putting together the fingers of its right hand, as if it were giving a
                  fillip. And there was on it the following inscription in Assyrian characters—

               <p>But Sardanapalus was not the only king who was very luxurious, but so was also
                  Androcotus the Phrygian. For he also used to wear a robe embroidered with flowers;
                  and to adorn himself more superbly than a woman, as Mnaseas relates, in the third
                  book of his History of Europe. But Clearchus, in the fifth book of his Lives, says
                  that Sagaus the king of the Mariandyni used, out of luxury, to eat, till he
                  arrived at old age, out of his nurse's mouth, that he might not have the trouble
                  of chewing his own food; and that he never put his hand lower than his navel; on
                  which account Aristotle, laughing at Xenocrates the Chalcedonian, for a similar
                  preposterous piece of laziness, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  governor of Babylon, wore the entire dress and ornaments of a woman; and though he
                  was only a slave of the king, there used to come into the room while he was at
                  supper a hundred and fifty women playing the lyre and singing. And they played and
                  sang all the time that he was eating. And Phoenix of Colophon, the poet, speaking
                  of Ninus, in the first book of his Iambics, says— <pb n="v.3.p.850"/>

               <p>But Theopompus, in the fifteenth book of his History of Philip, says that
                     <quote>Straton the king of Sidon surpassed all men in luxury and devotion to
                     pleasure. For as Homer has represented the Phæacians as living feasting and
                     drinking, and listening to harp-players and rhapsodists, so also did Straton
                     pass the whole of his life; and so much the more devoted to pleasure was he
                     than they, that the Phæacians, as Homer reports, used to hold their banquets in
                     the company of their own wives and daughters; but Straton used to prepare his
                     entertainments with flute-playing and harp-playing and lyre-playing women. And
                     he sent for many courtesans from Peloponnesus, and for many musicians from
                     Ionia, and for other girls from every part of Greece; some skilful in singing
                     and some in dancing, for exhibitions of skill in which they had contests before
                     himself and his friends; and with these women he spent a great deal of his
                     time. He then, <pb n="v.3.p.851"/> delighting in such a life as this, and
                     being by nature a slave to his passions, was also especially urged on by
                     rivalry with Nicocles. For he and Nicocles were always rivalling one another;
                     each of them devoted all his attention to living more luxuriously and
                     pleasantly than the other. And so they carried their emulation to such a
                     height, as we have heard, that when either of them heard from his visitors what
                     was the furniture of the other's house, and how great was the expense gone to
                     by the other for any sacrifice, he immediately set to work to surpass him in
                     such things. And they were anxious to appear to all men prosperous and
                     deserving of envy. Not but what neither of them continued prosperous throughout
                     the whole of their lives, but were both of them destroyed by violent

                  was the king of Salamis in Cyprus, and who was exceedingly devoted to luxury and
                  debauchery, and that they both came to a violent end.</p>

                     was a strong place in Thrace, having a large grove kept in beautiful order, and
                     full of every resource for living pleasantly, especially during the summer. For
                     it was one of the places which had been especially selected by Cotys, who, of
                     all the kings that ever lived in Thrace, was the most eager in his pursuit of
                     pleasure and luxury. And going round all the country, wherever he saw any place
                     shaded with trees and well watered with springs, he made it into a banqueting
                     place. And going to them whenever he chose, he used to celebrate sacrifices to
                     the Gods, and there he would stay with his lieutenants, being a very happy and
                     enviable man, until he took it into his head to blaspheme Minerva, and to treat
                     her with contempt.</quote> And the historian goes on to say, that Cotys once
                  prepared a feast, as if Minerva had married him; and prepared a bedchamber for
                  her, and then, in a state of intoxication, he waited for the goddess. And being
                  already totally out of his mind, he sent one of his body-guards to see whether the
                  goddess had arrived at the bedchamber. And when he came there, and went back and
                  reported that <pb n="v.3.p.852"/> there was nobody there, he shot him and killed
                  him. And he treated a second in the same way, until a third went, and on his
                  return told him that the goddess had been a long time waiting for him. And this
                  king, being once jealous of his wife, cut her up with his own hands, beginning at
                  her legs.</p>

               <p>But in the thirteenth book of his History of the Affairs of Philip, speaking of
                  Chabrias the Athenian, he says —<quote>But he was unable to live in the city,
                     partly on account of his intemperance, and partly because of the extravagant
                     habits of his daily life, and partly because of the Athenians. For they are
                     always unfavourable to eminent men; on which account their most illustrious
                     citizens preferred to live out of the city. For instance, Iphicrates lived in
                     Thrace, and Conon in Cyprus, and Timotheus in Lesbos, and Chares at Sigeum, and
                     Chabrias himself in Egypt.</quote> And about Chares he says, in his forty-fifth
                  book—"But Chares was a slow and stupid man, and one wholly devoted to pleasure.
                  And even when he was engaged in his military expeditions, he used to take about
                  with him female flute-players, and female harp-players, and a lot of common
                  courtesans. And of the money which was contributed for the purposes of the war,
                  some he expended on this sort of profligacy, and some he left behind at Athens, to
                  be distributed among the orators and those who propose decrees, and on those
                  private individuals who had actions depending. And for all this the Athenian
                  populace was so far from being indignant, that for this very reason he became more
                  popular than any other citizen; and naturally too: for they all lived in this
                  manner, that their young men spent all their time among flute-players and
                  courtesans; and those who were a little older than they, devoted themselves to

                  its public banquets and entertainments than on the provision necessary for the
                  well-doing of the state.</p>

                     sixty talents by means of Lysander. And with this money he gave a banquet to
                     the Athenians in the market-place, celebrating a triumphal sacrifice in honour
                     of their victory gained in the battle which <pb n="v.3.p.853"/> took place
                     against the foreign troops of Philip.</quote> And these troops were commanded
                  by Adæus, surnamed the Cock, con- cerning whom Heraclides the comic poet speaks in
                  the following manner— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But Idomeneus tells us that the Pisistratidæ also, Hippias and Hipparchus,
                  instituted banquets and entertainments; on which account they had a vast quantity
                  of horses and other articles of luxury. And this it was that made their government
                  so oppressive. And yet their father, Pisistratus, had been a moderate man in his
                  pleasures, so that he never stationed guards in his fortified places, nor in his
                  gardens, as Theopompus relates in his twenty-first book, but let any one who chose
                  come in and enjoy them, and take whatever he pleased. And Cimon afterwards adopted
                  the same conduct, in imitation of Pisistratus. And Theopompus mentions Cimon in
                  the tenth book of his History of the Affairs of Philip, saying—<quote>Cimon the
                     Athenian never placed any one in his fields or gardens to protect the fruit, in
                     order that any of the citizens who chose might go in and pick the fruit, and
                     take whatever they wanted in those places. And besides this, he opened his
                     house to every one, and made a daily practice of providing a plain meal for a
                     great number of people; and all the poor Athenians who came that way might
                     enter and partake of it. He also paid great attention to all those who from day
                     to day came to ask something of him; and they say that he used always to take
                     about with him one or two young men bearing bags of money. And he ordered them
                     to give money to whoever came to him to ask anything of him. And they say that
                     he also often contributed towards the expense of funerals. And this too is a
                     thing that he often did; whenever he met any citizen badly clad, he used to
                     order one of the young men who were following him to change cloaks with him.
                     And so by all these means he acquired a high reputation, and was the fist of
                     all the citizens.</quote>

               <p>And Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, says that Pericles,
                  nicknamed the Olympian, after he got rid of his wife out of his house, and devoted
                  himself to a life of pleasure, lived with Aspasia, the courtesan from Megara, and
                  spent the greater part of his substance on her. And Themistocles, when the
                  Athenians were not yet in such a state of intoxication, and had not yet begun to
                  use courtesans, openly filled a chariot with prostitutes, and drove early in the
                  morning through the Ceramicus when it was full. But Idomeneus has made this
                  statement in an ambiguous manner, so as to leave it uncertain whether he means
                  that he harnessed the prostitutes in his chariot like horses, or merely that he
                  made them mount his four-horsed chariot. And Possis, in the third book of his
                  History of the Affairs of Magnesia, says, that Themistocles, having been invested
                  with a crowned magistracy in Magnesia, sacrificed to Minerva, and called the
                  festival the Panathenæa. And he sacrificed also to Dionysius Choopotes, and
                  celebrated the festival of the Choeis there. But Clearchus, in the first book of
                  his treatise on Friendship, says that Themistocles had a triclinium of great
                  beauty made for him, and said that he should be quite contented if he could fill
                  that with friends.</p>

               <p>But Satyrus, speaking of the beautiful Alcibiades, says, —“It is said that when he
                  was in Ionia, he was more luxurious than the Ionians themselves. And when he was
                  in Thebes he trained himself, and practised gymnastic exercises, being more of a
                  Bœotian than the Thebans themselves. And in Thessaly he loved horses and drove
                  chariots; being fonder of horses than the Aleuadæ: and at Sparta he practiced
                  courage and fortitude, and surpassed the Lacedæmonians themselves. And again, in
                  Thrace he out-drank even the Thracians themselves. And once wishing to tempt his
                  wife, he sent her a thousand Darics in another man's name: and being exceedingly
                  beautiful in his person, he cherished his hair the greater part of his life, and
                  used to wear an extraordinary kind of shoe, which is called Alcibias from him. And
                  whenever he was a choregus, he made a procession clad in a purple robe; and going
                  into the theatre he was admired not only by the men, but also by the women: on
                  which account Antisthenes, the pupil of Socrates, who often had seen Alcibiades,
                  speaks of him as a powerful and manly man, and impatient of restraint, and
                  audacious, and exceedingly beautiful through all his life.</p>

                  <quote>And whenever he went on a journey he used four of the allied cities as his
                     maid-servants. For the Ephesians used to put up a Persian tent for him; and the
                     Chians used to find him food for his horses; and the people of Cyzicus supplied
                     him with victims for his sacrifices and banquet; and the Lesbians gave him
                     wine, and everything else which he wanted for his daily food. And when he came

                     beautiful than any of the women. And even when on military expeditions he

                     intemperance, anxious to live in foreign countries. And when the Tarentines
                     sent an embassy about an alliance, he was anxious to go out with them as an
                     ally; and being there, and having been slain in the wars, he was not thought
                     worthy even of a burial, although the Tarentines offered a great deal of money
                     to the enemy to be allowed to take up his body.</quote>

               <p>Now Callias and his flatterers we have already sufficiently mentioned. But since
                  Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasures, speaks of him, we will return
                  to the subject and quote what he says:—"When first the Persians made an expedition
                  against Greece, there was, as they say, an Eretrian of the name of Diomnestus, who
                  became master of all the treasures of the general; for he happened to have pitched
                  his tent in his field, and to have put his money away in some room of his house.
                  But when the Persians were all destroyed, then Diomnestus took the money without
                  any one being aware of it; but when the king of Persia sent an army into Eretria
                  the second time, ordering his generals utterly to destroy the city, then, as was
                  natural, all who were at all well off carried away their treasures. Accordingly
                  those of the family of Diomnestus who were left, secretly removed their money to
                  Athens, to the house of Hipponicus the son of Callias, who was surnamed Ammon; and
                  when all the Eretrians had been driven out of their city by the Persians, this
                  family remained still in possession of their wealth, which was great. So
                  Hipponicus, who was the son of that man who had originally received the deposit,
                  begged the Athenians to grant him a place in the Acropolis, where he might
                  construct a room to store up all this money in, saying that it was not safe for
                  such vast sums to remain in a private house. And the Athenians did grant him such
                  a place; but afterwards, he, being warned against such a step by his friends,
                  changed his mind.</p>
               <p>"Callias, therefore, became the master of all this money, and lived a life of
                  pleasure, (for what limit was there to the flatterers who surrounded him, or to
                  the troops of companions who were always about him? and what extravagance was
                  there which he did not think nothing of?) However, his voluptuous life afterwards
                  reduced him so low, that he was compelled to pass the rest of his life with one
                  barbarian old woman for a servant, and he was in want of actual daily necessaries,
                  and so he died.</p>

                     park a golden throne, and couches with silver feet, on which he used to sit and
                     transact business with his companions.</quote> But Nicobule says, that
                     <quote>while he was at supper all the morris dancers and athletes studied to
                     amuse the king; and at his very last banquet, Alexander, remembering an episode
                     in the Andromeda of Euripides, recited it in a declamatory manner, and then
                     drank a cup of unmixed wine with great eagerness, and compelled all the rest to
                     do so too.</quote> And Ephippus tells us that <quote>Alexander used to wear
                     even the sacred vestments at his entertainments; and sometimes he would wear
                     the purple robe, and cloven sandals, and horns of Ammon, as if he had been the
                     god; and sometimes he would imitate Diana, whose dress he often wore while
                     driving in his chariot; having on also a Persian robe, but displaying above his
                     shoulders the bow and javelin of the goddess. Sometimes also he would appear in
                     the guise of Mercury; at other times, and indeed almost every day, he would
                     wear a purple cloak, and a tunic shot with white, and a cap which had a royal
                     diadem attached to it. And when he was in private with his friends he wore the
                     sandals of Mercury, and the petasus on his head, and held the caduceus in his
                     hand. Often also he wore a lion's skin, and carried a club, like
                     Hercules.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>What wonder then is it, if in our time the emperor Com- modus, when he drove
                  abroad in his chariot, had the club of Hercules lying beside him, with a lion's
                  skin spread at his feet, and liked to be called Hercules, when even Alexander, the
                  pupil of Aristotle, represented himself as like so many gods, and even like Diana?
                  And Alexander used to have the floor sprinkled with exquisite perfumes and with
                  fragrant wine; and myrrh was burnt before him, and other kinds of incense; and all
                  the bystanders kept silence, or spoke only words of good omen, out of fear. For he
                  was a very violent man, with no regard for human life; for he appeared to be a man
                  of a melancholic constitution. And on one occasion, at Ecbatana, when he was
                  offering a sacrifice to Bacchus, and when everything was prepared in a most lavish
                  manner for the banquet, . . . and <pb n="v.3.p.861"/> Satrabates the satrap,

                  arrogant proclamations published, more insolent even than Persian arrogance was
                  wont to dictate. For, as different people were publishing different proclamations,
                  and proposing to make Alexander large presents, which they called crowns, one of
                  the keepers of his armoury, going beyond all previous flattery, having previously
                  arranged the matter with Alexander, ordered the herald to proclaim that Gorgos,
                  the keeper of the armoury, presents Alexander, the son of Ammon, with three
                  thousand pieces of gold; and will also present him, when he lays siege to Athens,
                  with ten thousand complete suits of armour, and with an equal number of catapults
                  and all weapons required for the war.</p>

               <p>And Chares, in the tenth book of his History of Alexander, says—"When he took
                  Darius prisoner, he celebrated a marriage-feast for himself and his companions,
                  having had ninety-two bedchambers prepared in the same place. There was a house
                  built capable of containing a hundred couches; and in it every couch was adorned
                  with wedding paraphernalia to the value of twenty minæ, and was made of silver
                  itself; but his own bed had golden feet. And he also invited to the banquet which
                  he gave, all his own private friends, and those he arranged opposite to himself
                  and the other bridegrooms; and his forces also belonging to the army and navy, and
                  all the ambassadors which were present, and all the other strangers who were
                  staying at his court. And the apartment was furnished in the most costly and
                  magnificent manner, with sumptuous garments and cloths, and beneath them were
                  other cloths of purple, and scarlet, and gold. And, for the sake of solidity,
                  pillars supported the tent, each twenty cubits long, plated all over with gold and
                  silver, and inlaid with precious stones; and all around these were spread costly
                  curtains embroidered with figures of animals, and with gold, having gold and
                  silver curtain-rods. And the circumference of the court was four stadia. And the
                  banquet took place, beginning at the sound of trumpet, at that marriage feast, and
                  on other occasions whenever the king offered a solemn sacrifice, so that all the
                  army knew it.</p>
               <pb n="v.3.p.862"/>
               <p>And this marriage feast lasted five days. And a great num- ber both of barbarians
                  and Greeks brought contributions to it; and also some of the Indian tribes did so.
                  And there were present some wonderful conjurors—Scymnus of Tarentum, and
                  Philistides of Syracuse, and Heraclitus of Mitylene; after whom also Alexis of
                  Tarentum, the rhapsodist, exhibited his skill. There came also harp-players, who
                  played without singing,—Cratinus of Methymne, and Aristonymus the Athenian, and
                  Athenodorus the Teian. And Heraclitus the Tarentine played on the harp,
                  accompanying himself with his voice, and so did Aristocrates the Theban. And of
                  fluteplayers accompanied with song, there were present Dionysius of Heraclea, and
                  Hyperbolus of Cyzicus. And of other fluteplayers there were the following, who
                  first of all played the air called The Pythian, and afterwards played with the
                  choruses,—Timotheus, Phrynichus, Caphesias, Diophantus, and also Evius the
                  Chalcidian. And from this time forward, those who were formerly called
                     Dionysio-colaces,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλαξ,</foreign> a flatterer.</note> were called
                  Alexandro-colaces, on account of the extravagant liberality of their presents,
                  with which Alexander was pleased. And there were also tragedians who
                  acted,—Thessalus, and Athenodorus, and Aristocritus; and of comic actors there
                  were Lycon, and Phormion, and Ariston. There was also Phasimelus the harp-player.
                  And the crowns sent by the ambassadors and by other people amounted in value to
                  fifteen thousand talents.</p>

                  Agatharchides of Cnidus, in the tenth book of his History of Asia, say that the
                  companions also of Alexander gave way to the most extravagant <pb n="v.3.p.863"/>
                  luxury. And one of them was a man named Agnon, who used to wear golden studs in
                  his sandals and shoes. And Cleitus, who was surnamed The White, whenever he was
                  about to transact business, used to converse with every one who came to him while
                  walking about on a purple carpet. And Perdiccas and Craterus, who were fond of
                  athletic exercises, had men follow them with hides fastened together so as to
                  cover a place an entire stadium in extent; and then they selected a spot within
                  the encampment which they had covered with these skins as an awning; and under
                  this they practised their gymnastics.</p>
               <p>They were followed also by numerous beasts of burden, which carried sand for the
                  use of the palæstra. And Leonnatus and Menelaus, who were very fond of hunting,
                  had curtains brought after them calculated to enclose a space a hundred stadia in
                  circumference, with which they fenced in a large space and then practised hunting
                  within it. And as for the golden plane-trees, and the golden vine—having on it
                  bunches of grapes made of emeralds and Indian carbuncles, and all sorts of other
                  stones of the most costly ad magnificent description, under which the kings of
                  Persia used often to sit when transacting business,—the expense of all this, says
                  Phylarchus, was far less than the daily sums squandered by Alexander; for he had a
                  tent capable of containing a hundred couches, and fifty golden pillars supported
                  it. And over it were spread golden canopies wrought with the most superb and
                  costly embroidery, to shade all the upper part of it. And first of all, five
                  hundred Persian Melophori stood all round the inside of it, clad in robes of
                  purple and apple-green; and besides them there were bowmen to the number of a
                  thousand, some clad in garments of a fiery red, and others in purple; and many of
                  them had blue cloaks. And in front of them stood five hundred Macedonian
                  Argyraspides; and in the middle of the tent was placed a golden chair, on which
                  Alexander used to sit and transact business, his body-guards standing all around.
                  And on the outside, all round the tent, was a troop of elephants regularly
                  equipped, and a thousand Macedonians, having Macedonian dresses; and then ten
                  thousand Persians: and the number of those who wore purple amounted to five
                  hundred, to whom Alexander gave this dress for them to wear. And though he had
                  such a numerous <pb n="v.3.p.864"/> retinue of friends and servants, still no one
                  dared to approach Alexander of his own accord; so great was his dignity and the
                  veneration with which they regarded him. And at that time Alexander wrote letters
                  to the cities in Ionia, and to the Chians first of all, to send him a quantity of
                  purple; for he wished all his companions to wear purple robes. And when his letter

                     <quote>Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, collected everything that was worth
                     speaking of everywhere to gratify his luxury, having assembled dogs from
                     Epirus, and goats from Scyros, and sheep from Miletus, and swine from
                     Sicily.</quote>
                  <pb n="v.3.p.865"/> And Alexis, in the third book of his Samian Annals, says that
                     <quote>Samos was adorned by Polycrates with the productions of many other
                     cities; as he imported Molossian and Lacedæmonian dogs, and goats from Scyros
                     and Naxos, and sheep from Miletus and Attica. He also,</quote> says he,
                     <quote>sent for artists, promising them enormous wages. But before he became
                     tyrant, having prepared a number of costly couches and goblets, he allowed any
                     one the use of them who was prepping any marriage-feast or extraordinary
                     entertainment.</quote> And after hearing all these particulars we may well
                  admire the tyrant, because it was nowhere written that he had sent for any women
                  or boys from any other countries, although he was of a very amorous constitution,
                  and was a rival in love of Anacreon the poet; and once, in a fit of jealousy, he
                  cut off all the hair of the object of his passion. And Polycrates was the first
                  man who called the ships which he had built Samians, in honour of his country.</p>
               <p>But Clearchus says that <quote>Polycrates, the tyrant of the effeminate Samos, was
                     ruined by the intemperance of his life, imitating the effeminate practices of
                     the Lydians; on which account, in opposition to the place in Sardis called the
                     beautiful Ancon, he prepared a place in the chief city of the Samians, called
                     Laura; he made those famous, Samian flowers in opposition to the Lydian. And
                     the Samian Laura was a narrow street in the city, full of common women, and of
                     all kinds of food calculated to gratify intemperance and to promote enjoyment,
                     with which he actually filled Greece. But the flowers of the Samians are the
                     preeminent beauty of the men and women, and indeed of the whole city, at its
                     festivals and banquets.</quote> And these are the words of Clearchus. And I
                  myself am acquainted with a narrow street in my native city of Alexandria, which
                  to this very day is called the Happy Street, in which every apparatus of luxury
                  used to be sold.</p>

                     such excessive expensive-ness that he exhibited it at Lacinium, at the festival

                  Polemo also speaks of it in his book entitled, A Treatise concerning the Sacred
                  Garments at Carthage. But concerning Smindyrides of Sybaris, and his luxury,
                  Herodotus has told us, in his sixth book, saying that he sailed from Sybaris to
                  court Agariste, the daughter of Clisthenes the tyrant of Sicyon.
                     <quote>And,</quote> says he, <quote>there came from Italy Smindyrides, the son
                     of Hippocrates, a citizen of Sybaris; who carried his luxury to the greatest
                     height that ever was heard of among men. At all events he was attended by a
                     thousand cooks and bird-catchers.</quote> Timæus also mentions him in his
                  seventh book. But of the luxury of Dionysius the younger, who was also tyrant of
                  Sicily, an account is given by Satyrus the Peripatetic, in his Lives. For he says
                  that he used to fill rooms holding thirty couches with feasters. And Clearchus, in
                  the fourth book of his Lives, writes as follows:—<quote>But Dionysius, the son of
                     Dionysius, the cruel oppressor of all Sicily, when he came to the city of the
                     Locrians, which was his metropolis, (for Doris his mother was a Locrian woman
                     by birth,) having strewed the floor of the largest house in the city with wild
                     thyme and roses, sent for all the maidens of the Locrians in turn; and then
                     rolled about naked, with them naked also, on this layer of flowers, omitting no
                     circumstance of infamy. And so, not long afterwards, they who had been insulted
                     in this manner having got his wife and children into their power, prostituted
                     them in the public roads with great insult, sparing them no kind of
                     degradation. And when they had wreaked their vengeance upon them, they thrust
                     needles under the nails of their fingers, and put them to death with torture.
                     And when they were dead, they pounded their bones in mortars, and having cut up
                     and distributed the rest of their flesh, they imprecated curses on all who did
                     not eat of it; and in accordance with this unholy imprecation, they put their
                     flesh into the mills with the flour, that it might be eaten by all those who
                     made bread. And all the other parts they sunk in the sea. But Dionysius
                     himself, at last going about as a begging priest of Cybele, and beating the
                     drum, ended his life very miserably. We, therefore, ought to guard against what
                     is called luxury, which is the ruin of a man's life; and we ought to think
                     insolence the destruction of everything.</quote>

                  that he was a slave to his luxury, writes as follows:—"He therefore was a slave to
                  luxury and debauchery. And he used to drive through the country on a four-wheeled
                  chariot, taking with him horses, and servants of great personal beauty, and a
                  disorderly crowd of flatterers and military boys running around his chariot. And

               <p>And Demetrius Phalereus, as Duris says in the sixteenth volume of his Histories,
                  being possessed of a revenue of twelve hundred talents a-year, and spending a
                  small portion of it on his soldiers, and on the necessary expenses of the state,
                  squandered all the rest of it on gratifying his innate love of debauchery, having
                  splendid banquets eve y day, and a great number of guests to feast with him. And
                  in the prodigality of his expense in his entertainments he outdid even <pb n="v.3.p.868"/> the Macedonians, and, at the same time, in the elegance of
                  them, he surpassed the Cyprians and Phœnicians. And perfumes were sprinkled over
                  the ground, and many of the floors in the men's apartments were inlaid with
                  flowers, and were exquisitely wrought in other ways by the artists. There were
                  also secret meetings with women, and other scenes more shameful still. And
                  Demetrius, who gave laws to others, and who regulated the lives of others,
                  exhibited in his own life an utter contempt of all law. He also paid great
                  attention to his personal appearance, and dyed the hair of his head with a yellow
                  colour, and anointed his face with rouge, and smeared himself over with other
                  unguents also; for he was anxious to appear agreeable and beautiful in the eyes of
                  all whom he met.</p>
               <p>And in the procession of the Dionysia, which he celebrated when he was archon at
                  Athens, a chorus sang an ode of Siromen the Solensian, addressed to him, in which
                  he was called, Like the Sun:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Honours you, Bacchus, with a holy worship.</l>
                  </quote> And Carystius of Pergamus, in the third book of his Commentaries,
                     says—<quote>Demetrius Phalereus, when his brother Himeræus was put to death by
                     Antipater, was himself staying with Nicanor; and he was accused of having
                     sacrificed the Epiphaneia in honour of his brother. And after he became a
                     friend of Cassander, he was very powerful. And at first his dinner consisted of
                     a kind of pickle, containing olives from all countries, and cheese from the
                     islands; but when he became rich, he bought Moschion, the most skilful of all
                     the cooks and confectioners of that age. And he had such vast quantities of
                     food prepared for him every day, that, as he gave Moschion what was left each
                     day, he (Moschion) in two years purchased three detached houses in the city;
                     and insulted free-born boys, and some of the wives of the most eminent of the
                     citizens: and all the boys envied Theognis, with whom he was in love. And so
                     important an honour was it considered to be allowed to come near Demetrius,
                     that, as he one day had walked about after dinner near the Tripods, on all the
                     following days all the most beautiful boys came together to that place, in the
                     hopes of being seen by him.</quote>

                  triumph, and gave an account of the war against Mithridates, ran into the most
                  unbounded extravagance, after having previously been very moderate; and was
                  altogether the first guide to luxury, and the first example of it, among the
                  Romans, having become master of the riches of two kings, Mithridates and Tigranes.
                  And Sittius, also, was a man very notorious among the Romans for his luxury and
                  effeminacy, as Rutilitius tells us; for as to Apicius, we have already spoken of

                  notorious for their luxury; on which account Agis said of Lysander, that Sparta
                  had produced him as a second Pausanias. But Theopompus, in the tenth book of his
                  History of the Affairs of Greece, gives exactly the contrary account of Lysander,
                  saying that <quote>he was a most laborious man, able to earn the goodwill of both
                     private individuals and monarchs, being very moderate and temperate, and
                     superior to all the allurements of pleasure; and accordingly, when he had
                     become master of almost the whole of Greece, it will be found that he never in
                     any city indulged in amatory excesses, or in unreasonable drinking parties and

                  luxurious, and also to a degree beyond what was becoming to a painter, laid claim,
                  in words, to great virtue, and inscribed upon the works which were done by him—

                  </quote> And once, at Samos, when he was contending with a very inferior painter
                  in a picture of Ajax, and was defeated, when his friends were sympathising with
                  him and expressing their indignation, he said that he himself cared very little
                  about it, but that he was sorry for Ajax, who was thus defeated a second time. And
                  so great was his luxury, that he wore a purple robe, and a white turban on his
                  head; and used to lean on a stick, ornamented all round with golden fretted work:
                  and he used even to fasten the strings of his sandals with golden clasps. However,
                  as regarded his art, he was not churlish or ill-tempered, but affable and
                  good-humoured; so that he sang all the time that he was painting, as Theophrastus
                  relates, in his treatise on Happiness.</p>

                  in that form and dress which was the best adapted for painting; on which account

               <p>We find also whole schools of philosophers which have openly professed to have
                  made choice of pleasure. And there is the school called the Cyrenaic, which
                  derives its origin from Aristippus the pupil of Socrates: and he devoted himself
                  to pleasure in such a way, that he said that it was the main end of life; and that
                  happiness was founded on it, and that happiness was at best but short-lived. And
                  he, like the most debauched of men, thought that he had nothing to do either with
                  the recollection of past enjoyments, or with the hope of future ones; but he
                  judged of all good by the present alone, and thought that having enjoyed, and
                  being about to enjoy, did not at all concern him; since the one case had no longer
                  any existence, and the other did not yet exist and was necessarily uncertain:
                  acting in this respect like thoroughly <pb n="v.3.p.871"/> dissolute men, who are
                  content with being prosperous at the present moment. And his life was quite
                  consistent with his theory; for he spent the whole of it in all kinds of luxury
                  and extravagance, both in perfumes, and dress, and women. Accordingly, he openly
                  kept Lais as his mistress; and he delighted in all the extravagance of Dionysius,
                  although he was often treated insultingly by him.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, Hegesander says that once, when he was assigned a very mean place at
                  a banquet by Dionysius, he endured it patiently; and when Dionysius asked him what
                  he thought of his present place, in comparison of his yesterday's seat, he said,
                     <quote>That the one was much the same as the other; for that one,</quote> says
                  he, <quote>is a mean seat to-day, because it is deprived of me; but it was
                     yesterday the most respectable seat in the room, owing to me: and this one
                     to-day has become respectable, because of my presence in it; but yesterday it
                     was an inglorious seat, as I was not present in it.</quote> And in another
                  place Hegesander says—<quote>Aristippus, being ducked with water by Dionysius's
                     servants, and being ridiculed by Antiphon for bearing it patiently, said, 'But
                     suppose I had been out fishing, and got wet, was I to have left my employment,
                     and come away? '</quote> And Aristippus sojourned a considerable time in
                  Aegina, indulging in every kind of luxury; on which account Xenophon says in his
                  Memorabilia, that Socrates often reproved him, and invented the apologue of Virtue
                  and Pleasure to apply it to him. And Aristippus said, respecting Lais, <quote>I
                     have her, and I am not possessed by her.</quote> And when he was at the court
                  of Diony- sius, he once had a quarrel with some people about a choice of three
                  women. And he used to wash with perfumes, and to say that— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And Aristoxenus the musician, in his Life of Archytas, represents ambassadors as
                  having been sent by Dionysius the younger to the city of the Tarentines, among
                  whom was Polyarchus, who was surnamed the Luxurious, a man wholly devoted to
                  sensual pleasures, not only in deed, but in word and profession also. And he was a
                  friend of Archytas, and not wholly unversed in philosophy; and so he used to come
                  with him into the sacred precincts, and to walk with him and with his friends,
                  listening to his lectures and arguments: and once, when there was a long dispute
                  and discussion about the passions, and altogether about sensual pleasures,
                  Polyarchus said—<quote>I, indeed, my friends, have often considered the matter,
                     and it has seemed to me that this system of the virtues is altogether a long
                     way removed from nature; for nature, when it utters its own voice, orders one
                     to follow pleasure, and says that this is the conduct of a wise man: but that
                     to oppose it, and to bring one's appetites into a state of slavery, is neither
                     the part of a wise man, nor of a fortunate man, nor indeed of one who has any
                     accurate understanding of what the constitution of human nature really is. And
                     it is a strong proof of this, that all men, when they have acquired any power
                     worth speaking of, betake themselves to sensual pleasures, and think the power
                     of indulging them the principal advantage to be gained from the possession of
                     power, and everything else, so to say, as unimportant and superfluous. And we
                     may adduce the example of the Persian king at present, and every other tyrant
                     possessed of any power worth speaking of,—and in former times, the sovereigns
                     of the Lydians and of the Medes,—and even in earlier times still, the tyrants
                     of the Syrians behaved in the same manner; for <pb n="v.3.p.873"/> all these
                     men left no kind of pleasure unexplored: and it is even said that rewards were
                     offered by the Persians to any one who was able to invent a new pleasure. And
                     it was a very wise offer to make; for the nature of man is soon satiated with
                     long-continued pleasures, even if they be of very exquisite nature. So that,
                     since novelty has a very great effect in making a pleasure appear greater, we
                     must not despise it, but rather pay great attention to it. And on this account
                     it is that many different kinds of dishes have been invented, and many sorts of
                     sweetmeats; and many discoveries have been made in the articles of incenses and
                     perfumes, and clothes, and beds, and, above all, of cups and other articles of
                     furniture. For all these things contribute some amount of pleasure, when the
                     material which is admired by human nature is properly employed: and this
                     appears to be the case with gold and silver, and with most things which are
                     pleasing to the eye and also rare, and with all things which are elaborated to
                     a high degree of perfection by manual arts and skill.</quote>

               <p>And having discussed after this all the attendance with which the king of the
                  Persians is surrounded, and what a number of servants he has, and what their
                  different offices are, and also about his amorous indulgences, and also about the
                  sweet perfume of his skin, and his personal beauty, and the way in which he lives
                  among his friends, and the pleasing sights or sounds which are sought out to
                  gratify him, he said that he considered <quote>the king of Persia the happiest of
                     all men now alive. For there are pleasures prepared for him which are both most
                     numerous and most perfect in their kind. And next to him,</quote> said he,
                     <quote>any one may fairly rank our sovereign, though he falls far short of the
                     king of Persia. For this latter has all Asia to supply him with luxury, but the
                     store which supplies Dionysius will seem very contemptible if compared with
                     his. That, then, such a life as h s is worth struggling for, is plain from what
                     has happened. For the Medes, after encountering the greatest dangers, derived
                     the Syrians of the supremacy, for no other object except to possess themselves
                     of the unrestrained licence of the Syria ns. And the Persians overthrew the
                     Medes for the same reason, namely, in order to have an unrestrained enjoyment
                     of sensual pleasures. And the lawgivers who wish the whole race of men to be on
                     an equality, and that no citizens shall indulge in <pb n="v.3.p.874"/>
                     superfluous luxury, have made some species of virtue hold its head up. And they
                     have written laws about contracts and other matters of the same kind, and
                     whatever appeared to be necessary for political communion, and also with
                     respect to dress, and to all the other circumstances of life, that they should
                     be similar among all the citizens. And so, as all the lawgivers made war upon
                     every kind of covetousness, then first the praises of justice began to be more
                     thought of: and one of the poets spoke of— <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <l>The golden face of justice;</l>
                     </quote> and in another passage some one speaks of— <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <l>The golden eye of justice.</l>
                     </quote> And the very name of justice came to be accounted divine, so that in
                     some countries there were altars erected and sacrifices instituted to Justice.
                     And next to this they inculcated a respect for modesty and temperance, and
                     called an excess in enjoyment covetousness; so that a man who obeyed the laws
                     and was influenced by the common conversation of men in general, was
                     necessarily moderate with respect to sensual pleasures.</quote>

                  as a young man he had come to Athens for the sake of his education, was most
                  accurately informed about everything relating to banquets and drinking parties,
                  and as to how much pay every courtesan required. But afterwards having become the
                  chief man of the Peripatetic school, he used to entertain his friends at banquets
                  with excessive arrogance and extravagance. For, besides the music which was
                  provided at his entertainments, and the silver plate and coverlets which were
                  exhibited, all the rest of the preparation and the superb character of the dishes
                  was such, and the multitude of tables and cooks was so great, that many people
                  were actually alarmed, and, though they wished to be admitted into his school,
                  shrunk back, fearing to enter, as into a badly governed state, which was always
                  burdening its citizens with liturgies and other expensive offices.</p>
               <p>For men were compelled to undertake the regular office of chief of the Peripatetic
                  school. And the duties of this office were, to superintend all the novices for
                  thirty days, and see that they conducted themselves with regularity. And then, on
                  the last day of the month, having received nine obols from each of the novices, he
                  received at supper not only all those who contributed their share, but all those
                  also whom Lycon might chance to invite, and also all those of the elders who were
                  diligent in attending the school; so that the money which was collected was not

                  to perform the sacrifices, and to become an overseer of the Muses. All which <pb n="v.3.p.877"/> duties appeared to have but little connexion with reason or
                  with philosophy, but to be more akin to luxury and parade. For if any people were
                  admitted who were not able to spend money on these objects, they, setting out with
                  a very scanty and ordinary choregia . . . . and the money was very much out of
                  proportion . . . . . For Plato and Speusippus had not established these
                  entertainments, in order that people might dwell upon the pleasures of the table
                  from day-break, or for the sake of getting drunk; but in order that men might
                  appear to honour the Deity, and to associate with one another in a natural manner;
                  and chiefly with a view to natural relaxation and conversation; all which things
                  afterwards became in their eyes second to the softness of their garments, and to
                  their indulgence in their before-mentioned extravagance. Nor do I except the rest.
                  For Lycon, to gratify his luxurious and insolent disposition, had a room large
                  enough to hold twenty couches, in the most frequented part of the city, in Conon's
                  house, which was well adapted for him to give parties in. And Lycon was a skilful

                     intemperance of all those who employed her. And his baker used to knead the
                     dough wearing gloves on his hands, and a cover on his mouth, to prevent any
                     perspiration running off his hands, and also to prevent him from breathing on

               <p>But the story which we have of Tithonus represents him as a person sleeping from
                  daybreak to sunset, so that his appetites scarcely awakened him by evening. On
                  which account he was said to sleep with Aurora, because he was so wholly enslaved
                  by his appetites. And as he was at a later period of life prevented from indulging
                  them by old age, and being wholly dependent on them. . . . And Melanthius,
                  stretching out his neck, was choked by his enjoyments, being a greater glutton
                  than the Melanthius of Ulysses. And many other men have destroyed their bodily
                  strength entirely by their unreasonable indulgence; and some have become
                  inordinately fat; and others have become stupid and insensible by reason of their
                  inordinate luxury. Accordingly, Nymphis of Heraclea, in the second book of his
                  History of Heraclea, says —<quote>Dionysius the son of Clearchus, who was the
                     first tyrant <pb n="v.3.p.879"/> of Heraclea, and who was himself afterwards
                     tyrant of his country, grew enormously fat without perceiving it, owing to his
                     luxury and to his daily gluttony; so the on account of his obesity he was
                     constantly oppressed by difficulty of breathing and a feeling of suffocation.
                     On which account his physicians ordered thin needles of an exceedingly great
                     length to be made, to be run into his sides an chest whenever he fell into a
                     deeper sleep than usual. And up to a certain point his flesh was so callous by
                     reason of the fat, that it never felt the needles; but if ever they touched a
                     part that was not so overloaded, then he felt them, and was awakened by them.
                     And he used to give answers to people who came to him, holding a chest in front
                     of his body so as to conceal all the rest of his person, and leave only his
                     face visible; and in this condition he conversed with these who came to
                     him.</quote> And Menander also, who was a person as little given to
                  evil-speaking as possible, mentions him in his Fishermen, introducing some exiles
                  from Heraclea as saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  the seventh book of his History, —But owing to his luxury his whole body was eaten
                  up with fat, and with the greatness of his belly, which was so large that no one
                  could put his arms all round it; and he wore <pb n="v.3.p.880"/> over it a tunic
                  which reached down to his feet, having sleeves which reached to his wrists, and he
                  never by any chance walked out except on this occasion of Scipio's visit." And
                  that this king was not averse to luxury, he tells us when he speaks of himself,
                  relating, in the eighth book of his Commentaries, how he was priest of Apollo at
                  Cyrene, and how he gave a banquet to those who had been priests before him;

                     sets before each of them a separate dish. And this dish is an earthenware
                     vessel, holding about twenty artabæ,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The artabe was equivalent to the Greek medimnus, which was a measure

                     attendant. But we ourselves omitted all this, and instead we furnished them
                     with cups of solid silver, each being of as much value as all the things which
                     we have just enumerated put together; and also we presented each man with a

               <p>And Agatharchides, in the sixteenth book of his History of Europe, says that
                  Magas, who was king of Cyrene for fifty years, and who never had any wars, but
                  spent all his time in luxury, became, towards the end of his life, so im- <pb n="v.3.p.881"/> mensely bulky and burdensome to himself, that he was at last
                  actually choked by his fat, from the inactivity of his body, and the enormous
                  quantity of food which he consumed. But among the Lacedæmonians, the same man
                  relates, in his twenty-seventh book, that it is thought a proof of no ordinary
                  infamy if any one is of an unmanly appearance, or if any one appears at all
                  inclined to have a large belly; as the young men are exhibited naked before the
                  ephori every ten days. And the ephori used every day to take notice both of the
                  clothes and bedding of the young men; and very properly. For the cooks at
                  Lacedæmon were employed solely on dressing meat plainly, and on nothing else. And
                  in his twenty-seventh book, Agatharchides says that the Lacedæmonians brought
                  Nauclides, the son of Polybiades, who was enormously fat in his body, and who had
                  become of a vast size through luxury, into the middle of the assembly; and then,
                  after Lysander had publicly reproached him as an effeminate voluptuary, they
                  nearly banished him from the city, and threatened him that they would certainly do
                  so if he did not reform his life; on which occasion Lysander said that Agesilaus
                  also, when he was in the country near the Hellespont, making war against the
                  barbarians, seeing the Asiatics very expensively clothed, but utterly useless in
                  their bodies, ordered all who were taken prisoners, to be stripped naked and sold
                  by the auctioneer; and after that he ordered their clothes to be sold without
                  them; in order that the allies, knowing that they had to fight for a great prize,
                  and against very contemptible men, might advance with greater spirit against their
                  enemies. And Python the orator, of Byzantium, as Leon, his fellow-citizen,
                  relates, was enormously fat; and once, when the Byzantians were divided against
                  one another in seditious quarrels, he, exhorting his fellow-citizens to unanimity,
                     said—<quote>You see, my friends, what a size my body is; but I have a wife who
                     is much fatter than I am; now, when we are both agreed, one small bed is large
                     enough for both of us; but when we quarrel, the whole house is not big enough

               <p>And Cinesias was in reality an exceedingly tall and exceedingly thin man; on whom
                  Strattis wrote an entire play, calling him the Phthian Achilles, because in his
                  own poetry he was constantly using the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθιῶτα.</foreign> And accordingly, he, playing on his appearance, continually
                  addresses him— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But others, as, for instance, Aristophanes, often call him <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλύρινος κινησίας,</foreign> because he took a plank of linden
                  wood <pb n="v.3.p.883"/> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλύρα</foreign>), and fastened
                  it to his waist under his girdle, in order to avoid stooping, because of his great
                  height and extreme thin, ness. But that Cinesias was a man of delicate health, and
                  badly off in other respects, we are told by Lysias the orator, in his oration
                  inscribed, <quote>For Phanias accused of illegal Practices,</quote> in which he
                  says that he, having abandoned his regular profession, had taken to trumping up
                  false accusations against people, and to making money by such means. And that he
                  means the poet here, and no one else, is plain from the fact that he shows also
                  that he had been attacked by the comic poets for impiety. And he also, in the
                  oration itself, shows that he was a person of that character. And the words of the
                  orator are as follows:—“But I marvel that you are not indignant at such a man as
                  Cinesias coming forward in aid of the laws, whom you all know to be the most
                  impious of all men, and the greatest violater of the laws that has ever existed.
                  Is not he the man who has committed such offences against the gods as all other
                  men think it shameful even to speak of, though you hear the comic poets mention
                  such actions of his every year? Did not Apollophanes, and Mystalides, and
                  Lysitheus feast with him, selecting one of the days on which it was not lawful to
                  hold a feast, giving themselves the name of Cacodæmonistæ,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Cacodæmonistæ, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸς,</foreign> bad, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμων,</foreign> a deity.

                  fortunes Nor, indeed, did it occur to them that they were really doing what that
                  name denotes; but they acted in this manner to show their contempt for the gods
                  and for our laws. And accordingly, each of those men perished, as it was
                  reasonable to expect that such men should.</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>But this man, with whom you are all acquainted, the gods have treated in
                     such a manner, that his very enemies would rather that he should live than die,
                     as an example to all other men, that they may see that the immortal Gods do not
                     postpone the punishment due to men who behave insolently towards their Deity,
                     so as to reserve it for their children; but that they destroy the men

                     calamities and diseases than on any other men whatever. For to die, or to be

                     common lot of all of us; but to be in such a condition as they are reduced to,
                     and to remain a long time in such a state, and to be dying every day, and yet
                     not be able to end one's life, is a punishment allotted to men who act as this
                     man has acted, in defiance of all human and divine law.</quote> And this orator

               <p>Philetas also, the Coin poet, was a very thin man; so that, by reason of the
                  leanness of his body, he used to wear balls made of lead fastened to his feet, to
                  prevent himself from being blown over by the wind. And Polemo, surnamed
                  Periegetes, in his treatise on Wonderful People and Things, says that Archestratus
                  the soothsayer, being taken prisoner by the enemy, and being put into the scale,
                  was found to weigh only one obol, so very thin was he. The same man also relates
                  that Panaretus never had occasion to consult a physician, but that he used to be a
                  pupil of Arcesilaus the philosopher; and that he was a companion of Ptolemy
                  Euergetes, receiving from him a salary of twelve talents every year. And he was
                  the thinnest of men, though he never had any illness all his life.</p>
               <p>But Metrodorus the Scepsian, in the second book of his treatise on the Art of
                  Training, says that Hipponax the poet was not only very diminutive in person, but
                  also very thin; and that he, nevertheless, was so strong in his sinews, that,
                  among other feats of strength, he could throw an empty oil cruise an extraordinary
                  distance, although light bodies are not easy to be propelled violently, because
                  they cannot cut the air so well. Philippides, also, was extremely thin, against
                  whom there is an oration extant of Hyperides the orator, who says that he was one
                  of those men who governed the state. And he was very insignificant in appearance
                  by reason of his thinness, as Hyperides has related. And Alexis, in his

               <p>And Clearchus the Solensian, in his treatise on Love Matters, says—“Why is it that

                  carry beautiful things in their hands, and take delight in them? Or do they carry
                  them about for two objects? For by these means the beginning of good fortune, and
                  an indication of one's wishes, is to a <pb n="v.3.p.887"/> certain extent
                  secured; to those who are asked for them, by their being addressed, and to those
                  who give them, because they give an intimation beforehand, that they must give of
                  their beauty in exchange. For a request for beautiful flowers and fruits,
                  intimates that those who receive them are prepared to give in return the beauty of
                  their persons. Perhaps also people are fond of those things, and carry them about
                  them in order to comfort and mitigate the vexation which arises from the neglect
                  or absence of those whom they love. For by the presence of these agreeable
                  objects, the desire for those persons whom we love is blunted; unless, indeed, we
                  may rather say that it is for the sake of personal ornament that people carry
                  those things, and take delight in them, just as they wear anything else which
                  tends to ornament. For not only those people who are crowned with flowers, but
                  those also who carry them in their hands, find their whole appearance is improved
                  by them. Perhaps also, people carry them simply because of their love for any
                  beautiful object. For the love of beautiful objects shows that we are inclined to
                  be fond of the productions of the seasons.</p>
               <p>For the face of spring and autumn is really beautiful, when looked at in their
                  flowers and fruits. And all persons who are in love, being made, as it were,
                  luxurious by their passion, and inclined to admire beauty, are softened by the
                  sight of beauty of any sort. For it is something natural that people who fancy

               <p>And that the luxury of madness is exceedingly great is very pleasantly argued by
                  Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, where he says—<quote>Thrasylaus
                     the Aexonensian, the son of Pythodorus, was once afflicted with such violent
                     madness, that he thought that all the vessels which came to the Piræus belonged
                     to him. And he entered them in his books as such; and sent them away, and
                     regulated their affairs in his mind, and when they returned to port he received
                     them with great joy, as a man might be expected to who was master of so much
                     wealth. And when any were lost, he never inquired about them, but he rejoiced
                     in all that arrived safe; and so he lived with great pleasure. But when his
                     brother Crito returned from Sicily, and took him and put him into the hands of
                     a doctor, and cured him of his madness, he himself related his madness, and
                     said that he had never been happier in his life; for that he never felt any
                     grief, but that the quantity of pleasure which he experienced was something
                     unspeakable.</quote>

               <p>ANTIPHANES the comic writer, my friend Timocrates, when he was reading one of his

                  matters, (for there was a good deal of conversation about married women and about
                  courtesans,) saying what we have to say to people who understand the subject,
                  invoking the Muse Erato to be so good as to impress anew on oar memory that

               <p>For our admirable host, praising the married women, said that Hermippus stated in
                  his book about lawgivers, that at Lacedæmon all the damsels used to be shut up in
                  a dark room, while a number of unmarried young men were shut up with them; and
                  whichever girl each of the young men caught hold of he led away as his wife,
                  without a dowry. On which account they punished Lysander, because he left his
                  former wife, and wished to marry another who was by far more beautiful. But
                  Clearchus the Solensian, in his treatise on Proverbs, says,—<quote>In Lacedæmon
                     the women, on a certain festival, drag the unmarried men to an altar, and then
                     buffet them; in order that, for the purpose of avoiding the insult of such
                     treatment, they may become more affectionate, and in due season may turn their
                     thoughts to marriage. But at Athens, Cecrops was the first person who married a
                     man to one wife only, when before his time connexions had taken place at
                     random, and men had had their wives in common. On which account it was, as some
                     people state, that Cecrops was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">διφυὴς,</foreign>
                     <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">διφυὴς</foreign> meaning, <quote>of double

                     </note> because before his time people did not know who their fathers were, by
                     reason of the numbers of men who might have been so.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>And beginning in this manner, one might fairly blame those who attributed to
                  Socrates two wives, Xanthippe and Myrto, the daughter of Aristides; not of that
                  Aristides who was surnamed the Just, (for the time does not agree,) but of his
                  descendant in the third generation. And the men who made this statement are
                  Callisthenes, and Demetrius Phalereus, and Satyrus the Peripatetic, and
                  Aristoxenus; who were preceded in it by Aristotle, who relates the same story in
                  his <pb n="v.3.p.890"/> treatise on Nobleness of Birth. Unless perhaps this
                  licence was allowed by a decree at that time on account of the scarcity of men, so
                  that any one who pleased might have two wives; to which it must be owing that the
                  comic poets make no mention of this fact, though they very often mention Socrates.
                  And Hieronymus of Rhodes has cited the decree about wives; which I will send to
                  you, since I have the book. But Panætius the Rhodian has contradicted those who
                  make this statement about the wives of Socrates.</p>

               <p>But among the Persians the queen tolerates the king's having a number of
                  concubines, because there the king rules his wife like her master; and also
                  because the queen, as Dinon states in his history of Persia, receives a great deal
                  of respect from the concubines. At all events they offer her adoration. And Priam,
                  too, had a great many women, and Hecuba was not indignant. Accordingly, Priam

               <p>But among the Greeks, the mother of Phœnix does not tolerate the concubine of
                  Amyntor. And Medea, although well acquainted with the fashion, as one well
                  established among the barbarians, refuses to tolerate the marriage of Glauce,
                  having been forsooth already initiated in better and Greek habits. And
                  Clytæmnestra, being exceedingly indignant at a similar provocation, slays
                  Cassandra with Agamemnon himself, whom the monarch brought with him into Greece,
                  having given in to the fashion of barbarian marriages. <quote>And a man may
                     wonder,</quote> says Aristotle, "that Homer has nowhere in the Iliad
                  represented any concubine as living with Menelaus, though he has given wives to
                  every one else. And accordingly, in Homer, even old men sleep with women, such as
                  Nestor and Phoenix. For these men were not worn out or disabled in the time of
                  their youth, either by intoxication, or by too much indulgence in love; or by any
                  weakness of digestion engendered by gluttony; so that it was natural for them to
                  be still vigorous in old age. The king of Sparta, then, appears to have too much
                  respect for his wedded wife Helena, on whose account he collected all the Grecian
                  army; and on this account he keeps aloof from any <pb n="v.3.p.891"/> other
                  connexion. But Agamemnon is reproached by Thersites, as a man with many wives—

               <p>But Hercules is the man who appears to have had more wives than any one else, for
                  he was very much addicted to women; and he had them in turn, like a soldier, and a
                  man employed at different times in different countries. And by them he had also a
                  great multitude of children. For, in one week, as Herodorus relates, he relieved
                  the fifty daughters of Thestias of their virginity. Aegeus also was a may of many
                  wives. For, first of all he married the daughter of Hoples, and after her he
                  married one of the daughters of Chalcodous, and giving both of them to his
                  friends, he cohabited with a great many without marriage. Afterwards he took
                  Aethra, the daughter of Pittheus; after her he took Medea. And Theseus, having
                  attempted to ravish Helen, after that carried off Ariadne. Accordingly Istrus, in
                  the fourteenth book of his History of the Affairs of Athens, giving a catalogue of
                  those women who became the wives of Theseus, says that some of them became so out
                  of love, and that some were carried off by force, and some were married in legal
                  marriage. Now by force were ravished Helen, Ariadne, Hippolyta, and the daughters
                  of Cercyon and Sinis; and he legally married Melibœa, the mother of Ajax. And
                  Hesiod say that he married also Hippe and Aegle; on account of whom he broke the
                  oaths which he had sworn to Ariadne, as Cercops tells us And Pherecydes adds
                  Pherebœa. And before ravishing Helen he had also carried off Anaxo from Troy; and
                  after Hippolyta he also had Phædra.</p>
               <p>And Philip the Macedonian did not take any women with him to his wars, as Darius
                  did, whose power was subverted by Alexander. For he used to take about with him
                     <pb n="v.3.p.892"/> three hundred and fifty concubines in all his wars; as
                  Dicæarchus relates in the third book of his Life in Greece. <quote>But
                     Philip,</quote> says he, <quote>was always marrying new wives in war time. For,
                     in the twenty-two years which he reigned, as Satyrus relates in his History of
                     his Life, having married Audata the Illyrian, he had by her a daughter named
                     Cynna; and he also married Phila, a sister of Derdas and Machatas. And wishing
                     to conciliate the nation of the Thessalians, he had children by two Thessalian
                     women; one of whom was Nicesipolis of Pheræ, who brought him a daughter named
                     Thessalonica; and the other was Philenora of Larissa, by whom he had Aridæus.
                     He also acquired the kingdom of the Molossi, when he married Olympias, by whom
                     he had Alexander and Cleopatra. And when he subdued Thrace, there came to him
                     Cithelas, the king of the Thracians, bringing with him Meda his daughter, and
                     many presents: and having married her, he added her to Olympias. And after all
                     these, being violently in love, he married Cleopatra, the sister of
                     Hippostratus and niece of Attalus. And bringing her also home to Olympias, he
                     made all his life unquiet and troubled. For, as soon as this marriage took
                     place, Attalus said, 'Now, indeed, legitimate kings shall be born, and not
                     bastards.' And Alexander having heard this, smote Attalus with a goblet which
                     he had in his hand; and Attalus in return struck him with his cup. And after
                     that Olympias fled to the Molossi; and Alexander fled to the Illyrians. And
                     Cleopatra bore to Philip a daughter who was named Europa.</quote>

               <p>And I do not think that any of you are ignorant, my friends, that the greatest
                  wars have taken place on account of women:—the Trojan war on account of Helen; the
                  plague which took place in it was on account of Chryseis; the anger of Achilles
                  was excited about Briseis; and the war called the Sacred War, on account of
                  another wife (as Duris relates in the second book of his History), who was a
                  Theban by birth, by name Theano, and who was carried off by some Phocian. And this
                  war also lasted ten years, and in the tenth year was brought to an end by the
                  cooperation of Philip; for by his aid the Thebans took Phocis.</p>
               <p>The war, also, which is called the Crissæan War (as Callisthenes tells us in his
                  account of the Sacred War), when the Crissæans made war upon the Phocians, lasted
                  ten years; and it was excited on this account,—because the Crissæans carried off
                  Megisto, the daughter of Pelagon the Phocian, and the daughters of the Argives, as
                  they were returning from the Pythian temple: and in the tenth year Crissa was
                  taken. And whole families also have been ruined owing to women;— for instance,
                  that of Philip, the father of Alexander, was ruined on account of his marriage
                  with Cleopatra; and Hercules was ruined by his marriage with Iole, the daughter of
                  Eurytus; and Theseus on account of his marriage with Phædra, the daughter of
                  Minos; and Athamas on account of his marriage with Themisto, the daughter of
                  Hypseus; and Jason on account of his marriage with Glauce, the daughter of Creon;
                  and Agamemnon on account of Cassandra. And the expedition of Cambyses against
                  Egypt (as Ctesias relates) took place on account of a woman; for Cambyses, having
                  heard that Egyptian women were far more amorous than other women, sent to Amasis
                  the king of the Egyptians, asking him for one of his daughters in marriage. But he
                  did not give him one of his own daughters, thinking that she would not be honoured
                  as a wife, but only treated as a concubine; but he sent him Nitetis, the daughter
                  of Apries. <pb n="v.3.p.897"/> And Apries had been deposed from the sovereignty
                  of Egypt, because of the defeats which had been received by him from the
                  Cyreneans; and afterwards he had been put to death by Amasis. Accordingly,
                  Cambyses, being much pleased with Nitetis, and being very violently in love with
                  her, learns the whole circumstances of the case from her; and she entreated him to
                  avenge the murder of Apries, and persuaded him to make war upon the Egyptians. But
                  Dinon, in his History of Persia, and Lynceas of Naucratis, in the third book of
                  his History of Egypt, say that it was Cyrus to whom Nitetis was sent by Amasis;
                  and that she was the mother of Cambyses, who made this expedition against Egypt to
                  avenge the wrongs of his mother and her family. But Duris the Samian says that the
                  first war carried on by two women was that between Olympias and Eurydice; in which
                  Olympias advanced something in the manner of a Bacchanalian, with drums beating;
                  but Eurydice came forward armed like a Macedonian soldier, having been already
                  accustomed to war and military habits at the court of Cynnane the Illyrian.</p>

               <p>And Pontianus said that Zeno the Cittiæan thought that Love was the God of
                  Friendship and Liberty, and also that he was the great author of concord among
                  men; but that he had no other office. On which account, he says in his Polity,
                  that Love is a God, being one who cooperates in securing the safety of the city.
                  And the philosophers, also, who preceded him considered Love a venerable Deity,
                  removed from everything discreditable: and this is plain from their having set up
                  holy statues in his honour in their Gymnasia, along with those of Mercury and
                  Hercules—the one of whom is the patron of eloquence, and the other of valour. And
                  when these are united, friendship and unanimity are engendered; by means of which
                  the most perfect liberty is secured to those who excel in these practices. But the
                  Athenians were so far from thinking that Love presided over the gratification of
                  the mere sensual appetites, that, though the Academy was manifestly consecrated to
                  Minerva, they yet erected in that place also a statue of Love, and sacrificed to
                  it.</p>
               <p>The Thespians also celebrate Erotidia, or festivals of Love, just as the Athenians
                  do Athenæa, or festivals of Minerva, and as the Eleans celebrate the Olympian
                  festivals, and the Rhodians the Halæan. And in the public sacrifices, everywhere
                  almost, Love is honoured. And the Lacedæmonians offer sacrifices to Love before
                  they go to battle, thinking that safety and victory depend on the friendship of
                  those who stand side by side in the battle array. And the Cretans, in their line
                  of battle, adorn the handsomest of their citizens, and employ them to offer
                  sacrifices to Love on behalf of the state, as Sosicrates relates. And the regiment
                  among the Thebans which is called the Sacred Band, is wholly composed of mutual
                  lovers, indicating the majesty of the God, as <pb n="v.3.p.899"/> these men
                  prefer a glorious death to a shameful and dis- creditable life. But the Samians
                  (as Erxias says, in his History of Colophon), having consecrated a gymnasium to
                  Love, called the festival which was instituted in his honour the Eleutheria, or
                  Feast of Liberty; and it was owing to this God, too, that the Athenians obtained
                  their freedom. And the Pisistratidæ, after their banishment, were the first people
                  who ever endeavoured to throw discredit on the events which took place through his
                  influence.</p>

               <p>After this had been said, Plutarch cited the following passage from the Phædrus of

                     <l>In great perplexity and sad distress,</l>
                     <l>I fell to thoughts of deep philosophy.</l>
                     <l>And first I thought that all the painters seem</l>
                     <l>Ignorant of the real nature of Love;</l>
                     <l>And so do all the other artists too,</l>
                     <l>Whoe'er make statues of this deity:,</l>
                     <l>For he is neither male nor female either;</l>
                     <l>Again, he is not God, nor yet is he man:</l>
                     <l>He is not foolish, nor yet is he wise;</l>
                     <l>But he's made up of all kinds of quality,</l>
                     <l>And underneath one form bears many natures.</l>
                     <l>His courage is a man's; his cowardice</l>
                     <l>A very woman's. Then his folly is</l>
                     <l>Pure madness, but his wisdom a philosopher's;</l>
                     <l>His vehemence is that of a wild beast,</l>
                     <l>But his endurance is like adamant;</l>
                     <l>His jealousy equals any other god's.</l>

               <p>But Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that all men love seasoned dishes, but
                  not plain meats, or plainly dressed fish. And accordingly, when seasoned dishes
                  are wanting, no one willingly eats either meat or fish; nor does any one desire
                  meat which is raw and unseasoned. For anciently men used to love boys (as
                  Aristophon relates); on which account it came to pass that the objects of their
                  love were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδικά.</foreign> And it was with truth
                  (as Clearchus says in the first book of his treatise on Love and the Affairs of

                  their affection, but only at their eyes, in which modesty makes her abode. And
                  Sophocles somewhere represents Hippodamia as speaking of the beauty of Pelops, and
                  saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But you prefer having all the objects of your love shaved and hairless. And this
                  custom of shaving the beard originated in the age of Alexander, as Chrysippus
                  tells us in the fourth book of his treatise on The Beautiful and on Pleasure. And
                  I think it will not be unseasonable if I quote what he says; for he is an author
                  of whom I am very fond, on account of his great learning and his gentle
                  good-humoured disposition. And this is the language of the philosopher:—
                     <quote>The custom of shaving the beard was introduced in the time of Alexander,
                     for the people in earlier times did not practise it; and Timotheus the
                     flute-player used to play on the flute having a very long beard. And at Athens
                     they even now remember that the man who first shaved his chin, (and he is not a
                     very ancient man indeed,) was given the surname of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόρσης;</foreign>
                     <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="grc">κείρω,</foreign> to cut the hair.</note>: on which account Alexis says—

                        <l>In one of these two ways he may be spoken of:</l>
                        <l>Either he seems to me to think of war,</l>
                        <l>And so to be rehearsing acts of fierce</l>
                        <l>Hostility against his beard and chin;</l>

                     </quote> And Diogenes, when he saw some one once whose chin was smooth, said,
                     'I am afraid you think you have great ground to accuse nature, for having made
                     you a man and not a woman.' And once, when he saw another man, riding a horse,
                     who was shaved in the same manner, and perfumed all over, and clothed, too, in
                     a fashion corresponding to those particulars, he said that he had often asked
                     what a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ʽἱππόπορνος</foreign> was; and now he had found
                     out. And at Rhodes, though there is a law against shaving, still no one ever
                     prosecutes another for doing so, as the whole population is shaved. And at
                     Byzantium, though there is a penalty to which any barber is liable who is
                     possessed of a razor, still every one uses a razor none the less for that
                     law.</quote> And this is the statement of the admirable Chrysippus.</p>

               <p>But I am a great admirer of beauty myself. For, in the contests [at Athens] for
                  the prize of manliness, they select the handsomest, and give them the post of
                  honour to bear the sacred vessels at the festivals of the gods. And at Elis there
                  is a contest as to beauty, and the conqueror has the vessels of the goddess given
                  to him to carry; and the next handsomest has the ox to lead, and the third places
                  the sacrificial cakes on the head of the victim. But Heraclides Lembus relates
                  that in Sparta the handsomest man and the handsomest woman have special honours
                  conferred on them; and Sparta is famous for producing the handsomest women in the
                  world. On which account they tell a story of king Archidamus, that when one wife
                  was offered to him who was very handsome, and another who was ugly but rich, and
                  he chose the rich one, the Ephori imposed a fine upon him, saying that he had

                  contended with one another respecting beauty; and it was on account of his beauty

                  Clitus and Tithonus; and Ceres with Jason; and Venus with Anchises and Adonis. And
                  it was for the sake of beauty also that the greatest of the gods entered through a
                  roof under the form of gold, and became a bull, and often transformed himself into
                  a winged eagle, as he did in the case of Aegina. And Socrates the philosopher, who
                  despised everything, was, for all that, subdued by the beauty of Alcibiades; as
                  also was the venerable Aristotle by the beauty of his pupil Phaselites. And do not
                  we too, even in the case of inanimate things, prefer what is the most beautiful?
                  The fashion, too, of Sparta is much praised, I mean that of displaying their
                  virgins naked to their guests; and in the island of Chios it is a beautiful sight
                  to go to the gymnasia and the race-courses, and to see the young men wrestling

                  run down; as Asclepiades, the son of Areas, relates in his History of Demetrius

               <p>I will now mention to you, O Cynulcus, an Ionian story (spinning it out, as
                  Aeschylus says,) about courtesans, beginning with the beautiful Corinth, since you
                  have reproached me with having been a schoolmaster in that city. It is an ancient
                  custom at Corinth (as Chamæleon of Heraclea relates, in his treatise on Pindar),
                  whenever the city addresses any supplication to Venus about any important matter,
                  to employ as many courtesans as possible to join in the supplication; and they,
                  too, pray to the goddess, and afterwards they are present at the sacrifices. And
                  when the king of Persia was leading his army against Greece (as Theopompus also
                  relates, and so does Timæus, in his seventh book), the Corinthian courtesans
                  offered prayers for the safety of Greece, going to the temple of Venus. On which
                  account, after the Corinthians had consecrated a picture to the goddess (which
                  remains even to this day), and as in this picture they had painted the portraits
                  of the courtesans who made this <pb n="v.3.p.917"/> supplication at the time, and
                  who were present afterwards, Simonides composed this epigram:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>These damsels, in behalf of Greece, and all</l>
                     <l>Their gallant countrymen, stood nobly forth,</l>
                     <l>Praying to Venus, the all-powerful goddess;</l>
                     <l>Nor was the queen of beauty willing ever</l>
                     <l>To leave the citadel of Greece to fall</l>
                     <l>Beneath the arrows of the unwarlike Persians.</l>
                  </quote> And even private individuals sometimes vow to Venus, that if they succeed
                  in the objects for which they are offering their vows, they will bring her a

               <p>As this custom, then, exists with reference to this goddess, Xenophon the
                  Corinthian, when going to Olympia, to the games, vowed that he, if he were
                  victorious, would bring her some courtesans. And Pindar at first wrote a panegyric
                  on him, which begins thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     And there is also a votive offering of hers besides that to Minerva

                  and Athenian women. He also fell in love with Medontis of Abydos, from the mere

                  of his on account of his beauty, (as Lysias the orator states, in his speech
                  against him,) he allowed Axiochus to share her with him. Moreover, Alcibiades used
                  always to carry about two other courtesans with him in all his expeditions,
                  namely, Damasandra, the mother of the younger Lais, and Theodote; by whom, after
                  he was dead, he was buried in Melissa, a village of Phrygia, after he had been
                  overwhelmed by the treachery of Pharnabazus. And we ourselves saw the tomb of
                  Alcibiades at Melissa, when we went from Synadæ to Metropolis; and at that tomb
                  there is sacrificed an ox every year, by the command of that most excellent

               <p>And we must not wonder at people having on some occasions fallen in love with
                  others from the mere report of their beauty, when Chares of Mitylene, in the tenth
                  book of his History of Alexander, says that some people have even seen in dreams
                  those whom they have never beheld before, and fallen in love with them so. And he
                  writes as follows: —<quote>Hystaspes had a younger brother whose name was
                     Zariadres: and they were both men of great personal beauty: And the story told
                     concerning them by the natives of the country is, that they were the offspring
                     of Venus and Adonis. Now Hystaspes was sovereign of Media, and of the lower
                     country adjoining it; and Zariadres was sovereign of the country above the
                     Caspian gates as far as the river Tanais. Now the daughter of Omartes, the king
                     of the Marathi, a tribe dwelling on the other side of the Tanais, was named
                     Odatis. And concerning her it is written in the Histories, that she in her
                     sleep beheld Zariadres, and fell in love with him; and that the very same thing
                     happened to him with respect to her. And so for a long time they were in love
                     with one another, simply on account of the visions which they had seen in their
                     dreams. And Odatis was the most beautiful of all the women in Asia; and
                     Zariadres also was very handsome. Accordingly, when Zariadres sent to Omartes
                     and expressed a desire to marry the damsel, Omartes would not agree to it,
                     because he was destitute of male offspring; <pb n="v.3.p.920"/> for he wished
                     to give her to one of his own people about his court. And not long afterwards,
                     Omartes having assembled all the chief men of his kingdom, and all his friends
                     and relations, held a marriage feast, without saying beforehand to whom he was
                     going to give his daughter. And as the wine went round, her father summoned
                     Odatis to the banquet, and said, in the hearing of all the guests,—'We, my
                     daughter Odatis, are now celebrating your marriage feast; so now do you look
                     around, and survey all those who are present, and then take a golden goblet and
                     fill it, and give it to the man to whom you like to be married; for you shall
                     be called his wife.' And she, having looked round upon them all, went away
                     weeping, being anxious to see Zariadres, for she had sent him word that her
                     marriage feast was about to be celebrated. But he, being encamped on the
                     Tanais, and leaving the army encamped there without being perceived, crossed
                     the river with his charioteer alone; and going by night in his chariot, passed
                     through the city, having gone about eight hundred stadia without stopping. And
                     when he got near the town in which the marriage festival was being celebrated,
                     and leaving, in some place near, his chariot with the charioteer, he went
                     forward by himself, clad in a Scythian robe. And when he arrived at the palace,
                     and seeing Odatis standing in front of the sideboard in tears, and filling the
                     goblet very slowly, he stood near her and said, '0 Odatis, here I am come, as
                     you requested me to,—I, Zariadres.' And she, perceiving a stranger, and a
                     handsome man, and that he resembled the man whom she had beheld in her sleep,
                     being exceedingly rejoiced, gave him the bowl. And he, seizing on her, led her
                     away to his chariot, and fled away, having Odatis with him. And the servants
                     and the handmaidens, knowing their love, said not a word. And when her father
                     ordered them to summon her, they said that they did not know which way she was
                     gone. And the story of this love is often told by the barbarians who dwell in
                     Asia, and is exceedingly admired; and they have painted representations of the
                     story in their temples and palaces, and also in their private houses. And a
                     great many of the princes in those countries give their daughters the name of
                     Odatis.</quote>

               <p>Aristotle also, in his Constitution of the Massilians, mentions a similar
                  circumstance as having taken place, writing <pb n="v.3.p.921"/> as

                     Marseilles. And Euxenus the Phocæan was connected by ties of hospitality with
                     Nanus; this was the name of the king of that country. This Nanus was
                     celebrating the marriage feast of his daughter, and invited Euxenus, who
                     happened to be in the neighborhood, to the feast. And the marriage was to be
                     conducted in this manner: —After the supper was over the damsel was to come in,
                     and to give a goblet full of wine properly mixed to whichever of the suitors
                     who were present she chose; and to whomsoever she gave it, he was to be the
                     bridegroom. And the damsel coming in, whether it was by chance or whether it
                     was for any other reason, gives the goblet to Euxenus. And the name of the
                     maiden was Petta. And when the cup had been given in this way, and her father
                     (thinking that she had been directed by the Deity in her giving of it) had
                     consented that Euxenus should have her, he took her for his wife, and cohabited
                     with her, changing her name to Aristoxena. And the family which is descended
                     from that damsel remains in Marseilles to this day, and is known as the
                     Protiadæ; for Protis was the name of the son of Euxenus and Aristoxena.</quote>

                  afterwards changed to Aspasia. And a Milesian concubine also accompanied him. And

                  law, that every one who was not born of a woman who was a citizen should be
                  accounted a bastard, was himself convicted, by Calliades the comic poet, of having
                  children by a courtesan named Choregis, as the same Carystius relates in the third
                  book of his Commentaries.</p>
               <p>Besides all these men, was not Demetrius Poliorcetes evidently in love with Lamia
                  the flute-player, by whom he had a daughter named Phila? And Polemo, in his
                  treatise on the colonnade called Pæcile at Sicyon, says that Lamia was the
                  daughter of Cleanor an Athenian, and that she built the before-mentioned colonnade
                  for the people of Sicyon. Demetrius was also in love with Leæna, and she was also
                  an Athenian courtesan; and with a great many other women besides.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="39">
               <p>And Machon the comic poet, in his play entitled the Chriæ, speaks thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But as Leæna was by nature form'd</l>
                     <l>To give her lovers most exceeding pleasure,</l>
                     <l>And was besides much favour'd by Demetrius,</l>
                     <l>They say that Lamia also gratified</l>
                     <l>The king; and when he praised her grace and quickness,</l>
                     <l>The damsel answer'd: And besides you can,</l>
                     <l>If you do wish, subdue a lioness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λέαιναν.</foreign>)</l>
                  </quote> But Lamia was always very witty and prompt in repartee, as also was
                  Gnathæna, whom we shall mention presently. And again Machon writes thus about
                  Lamia:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Demetrius the king was once displaying</l>

                     <l>Of kinds of perfumes to his Lamia:</l>
                     <l>Now Lamia was a female flute-player,</l>
                     <l>With whom 'tis always said Demetrius</l>
                     <l>Was very much in love. But when she scoff'd</l>
                     <l>At all his perfumes, and, moreover, treated</l>
                     <l>The monarch with exceeding insolence,</l>
                     <l>He bade a slave bring some cheap unguent, and</l>
                     <l>He rubbed himself with that, and smear'd his fingers,</l>
                     <l>And said, "At least smell this, O Lamia,</l>
                     <l>And see how much this scent does beat all others."</l>
                     <l>She laughingly replied: "But know, O king,</l>
                     <l>That smell does seem to me the worst of all."</l>
                     <l>
                        <quote>But,</quote> said Demetrius, "I swear, by the gods,</l>

                     says—<quote>Philip the Macedonian promoted Philinna, the dancing woman, by whom
                     he had Aridæus, who was king of Macedonia after Alexander. And Demetrius
                     Poliorcetes, besides the women who have already been mentioned, had a mistress
                     named Mania; and Antigonus had one named Demo, by whom he had a son named
                     Alcyoneus; and Seleucus the younger had two, whose names were Mysta and
                     Nysa.</quote> But Heraclides Lenebus, in the thirty-sixth book of his History,
                  says that Demo was the mistress of Demetrius; and that his father Antigonus was

            <div type="chapter" n="41">
               <p>But concerning the name of Mania, which we have just mentioned, the same Machon
                  says this:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Some one perhaps of those who hear this now,</l>
                     <l>May fairly wonder how it came to pass</l>
                     <l>That an Athenian woman had a name,</l>
                     <l>Or e'en a nickname, such as Mania.</l>
                     <l>For 'tis disgraceful for a woman thus</l>
                     <l>To bear a Phrygian name; she being, too,</l>
                     <l>A courtesan from the very heart of Greece.</l>
                     <l>And how came she to sink the city of Athens,</l>
                     <l>By which all other nations are much sway'd?</l>
                     <l>The fact is that her name from early childhood</l>
                     <l>Was this—Melitta. And as she grew up</l>
                     <l>A trifle shorter than her playfellows,</l>
                     <l>But with a sweet voice and engaging manners,</l>
                     <l>And with such beauty and excellence of face</l>
                     <l>As made a deep impression upon all men,</l>
                     <l>She 'd many lovers, foreigners and citizens.</l>
                     <l>So that when any conversation</l>
                     <l>Arose about this woman, each man said,</l>
                     <l>The fair Melitta was his madness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μανία.</foreign>)
                        Aye,</l>
                     <l>And she herself contributed to this name;</l>
                     <l>For when she jested she would oft repeat</l>
                     <l>This word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μανία;</foreign> and when in sport she
                        blamed</l>
                     <l>Or praised any one, she would bring in,</l>
                     <l>In either sentence, this word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μανία.</foreign>
                     </l>
                     <l>So some one of her lovers, dwelling on</l>
                     <l>The word, appears to have nicknamed the girl</l>
                     <l>Mania; and this extra name prevailed</l>
                     <l>More than her real one. It seems, besides,</l>
                     <l>That Mania was afflicted with the stone.</l>

               <p>And that Mania was also excellent in witty repartee, Machon tells us in these

                     <l>There was a victor in the pancratium,</l>

                     <l>And kept her with him as his lawful wife;</l>
                     <l>But finding afterwards that she did play</l>
                     <l>The harlot with Antenor, was indignant:</l>
                     <l>But she replied,—"My darling, never mind;</l>

                     <l>They say again that Mania once was ask'd,</l>

                     <l>Of all her beauties; and she, in return,</l>

                     <l>To reach a dish of hare, he tried to raise</l>
                     <l>A joke upon her, and thus spoke,—"My friends,</l>

                     <l>But this brave soldier, looking somewhat fierce,</l>
                     <l>Sent her away. And as she was departing,</l>
                     <l>She said," My love, don't be so much annoy'd;</l>

                  will not be unseasonable to enumerate some of them now. Accordingly he mentions
                  Gnathæna thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Diphilus once was drinking with Gnathæna.</l>

                     <l>And she replied, "'Tis no great wonder, Diphilus,</l>

                     <l>Diphilus was once invited to a banquet</l>

                     <l>Fish, and a cook, and a female flute-player.</l>
                     <l>In the meantime a Syrian friend of hers</l>
                     <l>Sent her some snow, and one saperdes; she</l>

                     <l>She had received such gifts, and, above all men,</l>
                     <l>Fearing lest Diphilus should get at them,</l>
                     <l>And show her up in one of his Comedies,</l>
                     <l>She bade a slave to carry off at once</l>
                     <l>The salt fish to the men who wanted salt,</l>
                     <l>As every one did know; the snow she told him</l>
                     <l>To mix with the wine unseen by any one.</l>
                     <l>And then she bade the boy to fill the cup</l>
                     <l>With ten full cyathi of wine, and bear it</l>
                     <l>At once to Diphilus. He eagerly</l>
                     <l>Received the cup, and drain'd it to the bottom,</l>

                     <l>Gnathæna, looking on his purple robe,</l>
                     <l>And princely bodyguard, said, "A thousand drachmæ."</l>
                     <l>He, as if smitten with a mortal wound,</l>
                     <l>Said, "I perceive, because of all these soldiers,</l>
                     <l>You look upon me as a captured enemy;</l>
                     <l>But take five mince, and agree with me,</l>
                     <l>And let them get a bed prepared for us."</l>
                     <l>She, as the satrap seem'd a witty man,</l>
                     <l>Received his terms, and said, "Give what you like,</l>

                     <l>You'll give my daughter twice as much at night."</l>
                     <l>There was at Athens once a handsome smith,</l>
                     <l>When she, Gnathænium, had almost abandon'd</l>
                     <l>Her trade, and would no longer common be,</l>
                     <l>Moved by the love of the actor Andronicus;</l>
                     <l>(But at this moment he was gone away,</l>
                     <l>After she'd brought him a male child;) this smith</l>
                     <l>Then long besought the fair Gnathænium</l>
                     <l>To fix her price; and though she long refused,</l>
                     <l>By long entreaty and liberality,</l>
                     <l>At last he won her over to consent.</l>
                     <l>But being but a rude and ill-bred clown,</l>
                     <l>He, one day sitting with some friends of his</l>
                     <l>In a leather-cutter's shop, began to talk</l>
                     <l>About Gnathænium to divert their leisure,</l>
                     <l>Narrating all their fond love passages.</l>
                     <l>But after this, when Andronicus came</l>
                     <l>From Corinth back again, and heard the news,</l>
                     <l>He bitterly reproach'd her, and at supper</l>
                     <l>He said, with just complaint, unto Gnathænium,</l>
                     <l>That she had never granted him such liberties</l>
                     <l>As this flogg'd slave had had allow'd to him.</l>
                     <l>And then they say Gnathænium thus replied:</l>
                     <l>That she was her own mistress, and the smith</l>
                     <l>Was so begrimed with soot and dirt that she</l>
                     <l>Had no more than she could help to do with him.</l>
                     <l>One day they say Gnathænium, at supper,</l>
                     <l>Would not kiss Andronicus when he wish'd,</l>
                     <l>Though she had done so every day before;</l>
                     <l>But she was angry that he gave her nothing.</l>
                     <l>Said he, on this, "Gnathena, don't you see</l>
                     <l>How haughtily your daughter's treating me?"</l>
                     <l>And she, indignant, said, "You wretched girl,</l>
                     <l>Take him and kiss him if he wishes it."</l>
                     <l>But she replied, "Why should I kiss him, mother,</l>
                     <l>Who does no good to any one in the house,</l>
                     <l>But seeks to have his Argos all for nothing "</l>
                     <l>Once, on a day of festival, Gnathænium</l>
                     <l>Went down to the Piræus to a lover,</l>

                     <l>Then, at a narrow spot in the road, they met</l>
                     <l>One of those knavish wrestlers, men who sell</l>
                     <l>Their battles, always taking care to lose them;</l>
                     <l>And as he could not pass by easily,</l>
                     <l>Being crowded up, he cried—"You wretched man,</l>

                     <l>Out of my way, I will upset these women,</l>
                     <l>And all the donkeys and the mule to boot."</l>
                     <l>But quick Gnathænium said, "My friend, I pray you,</l>

                  events, Aristophanes the Byzantian counted up a hundred and thirty-five, and
                  Apollodorus a still greater number; and Gorgias enumerated still more, saying
                  that, among a great many more, these eminent ones had been omitted by
                  Aristophanes—namely, one who was surnamed Paroinos, and Lampyris, and Euphrosyne:
                  and this last was the daughter of a fuller. And, besides these, he has omitted
                  Megisto, Agallis, Thaumarium, Theoclea (and she was nicknamed the Crow),
                  Lenætocystos, Astra, Gnathæna, and her grand-daughter Gnathænium, and Sige, and

                  violently in love with Gnathæna, (as has been already stated, and as Lynceus the
                  Samian relates in his Commentaries;) and so once, when on the stage he had acted
                  very badly, and was turned out (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠρμένος</foreign>) of the
                  theatre, and, for all that, came to Gnathæna as if nothing had happened; and when
                  he, after he had arrived, begged Gnathæna to wash his feet, <quote>Why do you want
                     that?</quote> said she; <quote>were you not carried (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠρμένος</foreign>) hither?</quote> And Gnathæna was very ready with her
                  repartees. And there were other courtesans who had a great opinion of themselves,
                  paying attention to education, and spending a part of their time on literature; so
                  that they were very ready with their rejoinders and replies.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, when on one occasion Stilpo, at a banquet, was accusing Glycera of
                  seducing the young men of the city, (as Satyrus mentions in his Lives,) Glycera
                  took him up and said, "You and I are accused of the same thing, O Stilpo; for they
                  say that you corrupt all who come to you, by teaching them profitless and amorous
                  sophistries; and they accuse me of the same thing: for if people waste their time,
                  and are treated ill, it makes no difference whether they are living with a
                  philosopher or with a harlot." For, according to Agathon, <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And Lynceus has recorded many repartees of Gnathæna. There was a parasite who used
                  to live upon an old woman, and kept himself in very good condition; and Gnathæna,
                  seeing him, said, <quote>My young friend, you appear to be in very good

                     guineas.</quote> There was a man who once gave her daughter a mina, and never

                  other certainly wanted it as Gnathæna hinted. On one occasion, some men were
                  drinking in her house, and were eating some lentils dressed with onions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βολβοφάκη</foreign>); as the maidservant was clearing the table,

                  excusing them, I will enumerate some instances of those who have done so. For
                  Demosthenes, in his speech against Androtion, mentions Sinope and Phanostrate; and
                  respecting Sinope, Herodicus the pupil of Crates says, in the sixth book of his
                  treatise on People mentioned in the Comic Poets, that she was called Abydus,
                  because she was an old woman. And Antiphanes <pb n="v.3.p.935"/> mentions her in
                  his Arcadian, and in his Gardener, and in his Sempstress, and in his Female
                  Fisher, and in his Neottis. And Alexis mentions her in his Cleobuline, and
                  Callicrates speaks of her in his Moschion; and concerning Phanostrate,
                  Apollodorus, in his treatise on the Courtesans at Athens, says that she was called
                  Phtheiropyle, because she used to stand at the door (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πύλη</foreign>) and hunt for lice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φθεῖρες</foreign>).</p>
               <p>And in his oration against Aristagoras, Hyperides says— <quote>And again you have
                     named, in the same manner, the animals called aphyæ.</quote> Now, aphyæ,
                  besides meaning anchovies, was also a nickname for some courtesans; concerning
                  whom the before-mentioned Apollodorus says—<quote>Stagonium and Amphis were two
                     sisters, and they were called Aphyæ, because they were white, and thin, and had
                     large eyes.</quote> And Antiphanes, in his book on Courtesans, says that
                  Nicostratis was called Aphya for the same reason. And the same Hyperides, in his
                  speech against Mantitheus, who was being prosecuted for an assault, speaks in the
                  following manner respecting Glycera—<quote>Bringing with him Glycera the daughter
                     of Thalassis in a pair-horse chariot.</quote> But it is uncertain whether this
                  is the same Glycera who was take mistress of Harpalus; concerning whom Theopompus
                  speaks in his treatise on the Chian Epistle, saying that after the death of
                  Pythionica, Harpalus sent for Glycera to come to him from Athens; and when she
                  came, she lived in the palace which is at Tarsus, and was honoured with royal
                  honours by the populace, and was called queen; and an edict was issued, forbidding
                  any one to present Harpalus with a crown, without at the same time presenting
                  Glycera with another. And at Rhossus, he went so far as to erect a brazen statue
                  of her by the side of his own statue. And Clitarchus has given the same account in
                  his History of Alexander. But the author of Agen, a satyric drama, (whoever he
                  was, whether it was Python of Catana, or king Alexander himself,) says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And now they say that Harpalus has sent them</l>

               <p>And Lysias, in his oration against Lais, if, indeed, the speech is a genuine one,

                     she was <pb n="v.3.p.936"/> still quite young; and so did Scione, and

                  Antea, by either Eunicus or Philyllius. And the author of the oration against
                  Neæra, whoever he was, also mentions her. But in the oration against Philonides,
                  who was being prosecuted for an assault, Lysias, if at least it is a genuine
                  speech of his, mentions also a courtesan called Nais. And in his speech against
                  Medon, for perjury, he mentions one by the name of Anticyra; but this was only a
                  nickname given to a woman, whose real name was Hoia, as Antiphanes informs us in
                  his treatise on Courtesans, where he says that she was called Anticyra,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Anticyra was the name of three islands
                     celebrated as producing a great quantity of hellebore. Horace, speaking of a

                  or else because she was at one time the mistress of Nicostratus the physician, and
                  he, when he died, left her a great quantity of hellebore, and nothing else.
                  Lycurgus, also, in his oration against Leocrates, mentions a courtesan named
                  Irenis, as being the mistress of Leocrates. And Hyperides mentions Nico in his
                  oration against Patrocles. And we have already mentioned that she used to be
                  nicknamed the Goat, because she had ruined Thallus the innkeeper. And that the
                  goats are very fond of the young shoots of the olive (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλλοι</foreign>), on which account the animal is never allowed to approach
                  the Acropolis, and is also never sacrificed to Minerva, is a fact which we shall
                  dilate upon hereafter. But Sophocles, in his play called The Shepherds, mentions
                  that this animal does browse upon the young shoots, speaking as follows— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>By the projecting headland.</l>
                  </quote> Alexis also mentions Nannium, in his Tarentines, thus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     nicknamed the Proscenium, because she had a beautiful face, and used to wear
                     very costly garments embroidered with gold, but when she was undressed s e was
                     a very bad figure. And Corone was Nannium's daughter, and she was nicknamed
                     Tethe, from her exceedingly debauched habits.</quote> Hyperides, in his oration
                  against Patrocles, also speaks of a female flute-player named Nemeas. And we may
                  wonder how it was that the Athenians permitted a courtesan to have such a name,
                  which was that of a most honourable and solemn festival. For not only those who
                  prostituted themselves, but all other slaves also were forbidden to take such
                  names as that, as Polemo tells us, in his treatise on the Acropolis.</p>

                  called Voluptuaries, yourselves broke down the wall of pleasure, as Eratosthenes
                  somewhere or other expresses it. And indeed I have now quoted enough of the smart
                  sayings of the courtesans, and I will pass on to another topic. And first of all,
                  I will speak of that most devoted lover of truth, Epicurus, who, never having been
                  initiated into the encyclic series of learning, used to say that those were well
                  off who applied themselves to philosophy in the same way in which he did himself;
                  and these were his words—<quote>I praise and congratulate you, my young man,
                     because you have come over to the study of philosophy unimbued with any

                  celebrated as a courtesan? But she did not cease to live as a prostitute when she
                  began to learn philosophy, but still prostituted herself to the whole sect of
                  Epicureans in the gardens, and to Epicurus himself, in the most open manner; so
                  that this great philosopher was exceedingly fond of her, though he mentions this
                  fact in his epistles to Hermarchus.</p>

               <p>But as for Lais of Hyccara—(and Hyccara is a city in Sicily, from which place she
                  came to Corinth, having been made a prisoner of war, as Polemo relates in the
                  sixth book of his History, addressed to Timæus: and Aristippus was one of her
                  lovers, and so was Demosthenes the orator, and Diogenes the Cynic: and it was also
                  said that the Venus, which is at Corinth, and is called Melænis, appeared to her
                  in a dream, intimating to her by such an appearance that she would be courted by
                  many lovers of great wealth;)—Lais, I say, is mentioned by Hyperides, in the
                  second of his speeches against Aristagoras. And Apelles the painter, having seen
                     <pb n="v.3.p.939"/> Lais while she was still a maiden, drawing water at the
                  fountain Pirene, and marvelling at her beauty, took her with him on one occasion
                  to a banquet of his friends. And when his companions laughed at him because he had
                  brought a maiden with him to the party, instead of a courtesan he said —<quote>Do
                     not wonder, for I will show you that she is quite beautiful enough for future
                     enjoyment within three years.</quote> And a prediction of this sort was made by
                  Socrates also, respecting Theodote the Athenian, as Xenophon tells us in his
                  Memorabilia, for he used to say—<quote>That she was very beautiful, and had a
                     bosom finely shaped beyond all description. And let us,</quote> said he,
                     <quote>go and see the woman; for people cannot judge of beauty by
                     hearsay.</quote> But Lais was so beautiful, that painters used to come to her
                  to copy her bosom and her breasts. And Lais was a rival of Phryne, and had an
                  immense number of lovers, never caring whether they were rich or poor, and never
                  treating them with any insolence.</p>

               <p>And Aristippus every year used to spend whole days with her in Aegina, at the

                     myself may enjoy her, and not that no one else may.</quote> And when Diogenes
                  said, "Since you, O Aristippus, cohabit with a common prostitute, either,
                  therefore, become a Cynic yourself, as I am, or else abandon her;" Aristippus
                  answered him—<quote>Does it appear to you, O Diogenes, an absurd thing to live in
                     a house where other men have lived before you.?</quote>
                  <quote>Not at all,</quote> said he. <quote>Well, then, does it appear to you

                  <quote>By no means,</quote> said he. <quote>Well, then,</quote> replied
                  Aristippus, <quote>it is not a bit more absurd to be in love with a woman with

                  Socrates; and that, too, though he was a man who had acquired such a vast
                  reputation for wisdom and political sagacity? But, indeed, Pericles was always a

                  Antisthenes, the pupil of Socrates, tells us that Pericles, being in love with
                  Aspasia, used to kiss her twice every day, once when he entered her house, and
                  once when he left it. And when she was impeached for impiety, he himself spoke in
                  her behalf, and shed more tears for her sake than he did when his own property and
                  his own life were imperilled. Moreover, when Cimon had had an incestuous intrigue
                  with Elpinice, his sister, who was afterwards given in marriage to Callias, and

                  Phœnix. Learn, then, that Alexis, in his <pb n="v.3.p.942"/> Pyraunus, has said
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν τίγριν,</foreign> using the word in the mas- culine
                  gender; and these are his words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Come, open quick the door; I have been here,</l>
                     <l>Though all unseen, walking some time,—a statue,</l>
                     <l>A millstone, and a seahorse, and a wall,</l>
                     <l>The tiger (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ τίγρις</foreign>) of Seleucus.</l>
                  </quote> And I might quote other evidences of the fact, but I postpone them for
                  the present, while I finish my catalogue, as far as it comprehends the beautiful
                  women.</p>

               <p>For Clearchus speaks thus concerning Epaminondas: <quote>Epaminondas the Theban
                     behaved with more dignity than these men did; but still there was a want of
                     dignity in the way in which he was induced to waver in his sentiments in his
                     association with women, as any one will admit who considers his conduct with
                     the wife of Lacon.</quote> But Hyperides the orator, having driven his son
                  Glaucippus out of his house, received into it that most extravagant courtesan
                  Myrrhina, and kept her in the city; and he also kept Aristagora in the Piræus, and
                  Phila at Eleusis, whom he bought for a very large sum, and then emancipated; and
                  after that he made her his housekeeper, as Idomeneus relates. But, in his oration
                  in defence of Phryne, Hyperides confesses that he is in love with the woman; and
                  yet, before he had got cured of that love, he introduced the above-mentioned
                  Myrrhina into his house.</p>

               <p>Now Phryne was a native of Thespiæ; and being prosecuted by Euthias on a capital
                  charge, she was acquitted: on which account Euthias was so indignant that he never
                  instituted any prosecution afterwards, as Hermippus tells us. But Hyperides, when
                  pleading Phryne's cause, as he did not succeed at all, but it was plain that the
                  judges were about to condemn her, brought her forth into the middle of the court,
                  and, tearing open her tunic and displaying her naked bosom, employed all the end
                  of his speech, with the highest oratorical art, to excite the pity of her judges
                  by the sight of her beauty, and inspired the judges with a superstitious fear, so
                  that they were so moved by pity as not to be able to stand the idea of condemning
                  to death <quote>a prophetess and priestess of Venus.</quote> And when she was
                  acquitted, a decree was drawn up in the following form: <quote>That hereafter no

                     one, and that no man or woman, when impeached, shall have his or her case

               </p>
               <p>But Phryne was a really beautiful woman, even in those parts of her person which
                  were not generally seen: on which account it was not easy to see her naked; for
                  she used to wear a tunic which covered her whole person, and she never used the
                  public baths. But on the solemn assembly of the Eleusinian festival, and on the
                  feast of the Posidonia, then she laid aside her garments in the sight of all the
                  assembled Greeks, and having undone her hair, she went to bathe in the sea; and it
                  was from her that Apelles took his picture of the Venus Anadyomene; and Praxiteles
                  the statuary, who was a lover of hers, modelled the Cnidian Venus from her body;
                  and on the pedestal of his statue of Cupid, which is placed below the stage in the
                  theatre, he wrote the following inscription:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Praxiteles has devoted earnest care</l>

                     <l>Drawing his model from his inmost heart:</l>
                     <l>I gave myself to Phryne for her wages,</l>
                     <l>And now I no more charms employ, nor arrows,</l>
                     <l>Save those of earnest glances at my love.</l>
                  </quote> And he gave Phryne the choice of his statues, whether she chose to take
                  the Cupid, or the Satyrus which is in the street called the Tripods; and she,
                  having chosen the Cupid, consecrated it in the temple at Thespiæ. And the people
                  of her neighbourhood, having had a statue made of Phryne herself, of solid gold,
                  consecrated it in the temple of Delphi, having had it placed on a pillar of
                  Pentelican marble; and the statue was made by Praxiteles. And when Crates the

                  king of the Lacedæmonians, and that of Philip the son of Amyntas; and it bore this

                  told by Alcetas, in the second book of his treatise on the Offerings at

               <p>But Apollodorus, in his book on Courtesans, says that there were two women named
                  Phryne, one of whom was nicknamed Clausigelos,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλαίω,</foreign> to weep, and

                  Saperdium. But Herodicus, <pb n="v.3.p.944"/> in the sixth book of his Essay on
                  People mentioned by the Comic Poets, says that the one who is mentioned by the
                  orators was called Sestos, because she sifted (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποσήθω</foreign>) and stripped bare all her lovers; and that the other was
                  the native of Thespiæ. But Phryne was exceedingly rich, and she offered to build a
                  wall round Thebes, if the Thebans would inscribe on the wall, <quote>Alexander
                     destroyed this wall, but Phryne the courtesan restored it;</quote> as
                  Callistratus states in his treatise on Courtesans. And Timocles the comic poet, in
                  his Neæra, has mentioned her riches (the passage has been already cited); and so
                  has Amphis, in his Curis. And Gryllion was a parasite of Phryne's, though he was
                  one of the judges of the Areopagus; as also Satyrus, the Olynthian actor, was a
                  parasite of Pamphila. But Aristogiton, in his book against Phryne, says that her
                  proper name was Mnesarete; and I am aware that Diodorus Periegetes says that the
                  oration against her which is ascribed to Euthias, is really the work of
                  Anaximenes. But Posidippus the comic poet, in his Ephesian Women, speaks in the
                  following manner concerning her:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>But she besought the judges separately</l>

               <p>And I would have you all to know that Democles, the orator, became the father of
                  Demeas, by a female flute-player who was a courtesan; and once when he, Demeas,
                  was giving himself airs in the tribune, Hyperides stepped his mouth, saying,
                     <quote>Will not you be silent, young man? why, you make more puffing than your
                     mother did.</quote> And also Bion of the Borysthenes, the philosopher, was the
                  son of a Laced$emonian courtesan named Olympia; as Nicias the Nicæan informs us in
                  his treatise called the Successions of the Philosophers. And Sophocles the
                  tragedian, when he was an old man, was a lover of Theoris the courtesan; and
                  accordingly, supplicating the favour and assistance of Venus, he says— <pb n="v.3.p.945"/>

               <p>But Isocrates also, the most modest of all the orators, had a mistress named
                  Metanira, who was very beautiful, as Lysias relates in his Letters. But
                  Demosthenes, in his oration against Neæra, says that Metanira was the mistress of
                  Lysias. And Lysias also was desperately in love with Lagis the courtesan, whose
                  panegyric Cephalus the orator wrote, just as Alcidamas the Elæan, the pupil of
                  Gorgias, himself wrote a panegyric on the courtesan Nais. And, in his oration
                  against Philonides, who was under prosecution for an assault, (if, at least, the
                  oration be a genuine one,) Lysias says that Nais was the mistress of Philonides,
                  writing as follows:—<quote>There is then a woman who is a courtesan, Nais by name,
                     whose keeper is Archias; but your friend Philonides states himself to be in
                     love with her.</quote> Aristophanes also mentions her in his Gerytades, and
                  perhaps also in his Plutus, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Is it not owing to you the greedy Lais</l>
                     <l>Does love Philonides</l>
                  </quote> For perhaps here we ought to read Nais, and not Lais. But Hermippus, in
                  his Essay on Isocrates, says that Isocrates, when he was advancing in years, took
                  the courtesan Lagisca to his house, and had a daughter by her. And Strattis speaks
                  of her in these lines:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  in the following words:—"Philyra indeed abandoned the trade of a courtesan while
                  she was still young; and Scione, and Hippaphesis, and Theoclea, and Psamathe, and

               <p>But it is reported that Demosthenes the orator had children by a courtesan; at all
                  events he himself, in his speech about gold, introduced his children before the
                  court, in order to obtain pity by their means, without their mother; although it
                  was customary to bring forward the wives of those who were on their trial;
                  however, he did this for shame's sake, hoping to avoid calumny. But this orator
                  was exceedingly addicted to amorous indulgences, as Idomeneus tells us.
                  Accordingly, being in love with a youth named Aristarchus, he once, when he was
                  intoxicated, insulted Nicodemus on his account, and struck out his eyes. He is
                  related also to have been very extravagant in his table, and his followers, and in
                  women. Therefore, his secretary once said, <quote>But what can any one say of
                     Demosthenes? For everything that he has thought of for a whole year, is all
                     thrown into confusion by one woman in one night.</quote> Accordingly, he is
                  said to have received into his house a youth named Cnosion, although he had a

                  her his partner in the kingdom, as Nicolaus of Damascus tells us. And Ptolemy the
                  son of Ptolemy Philadelphus the king, who was governor of the garrison in Ephesus,
                  had a mistress named Irene. And she, when plots were laid against Ptolemy by the
                  Thracians at Ephesus, and when he fled to the temple of Diana, fled with him: and
                  when the conspirators had murdered him, Irene seizing hold of the bars of the
                  doors of the temple, sprinkled the altar with his blood till they slew her also.
                  And Sophron the governor of Ephesus had a mistress, Danae, the daughter of
                  Leontium the Epicurean, who was also a courtesan herself. And by her means he was
                  saved when a plot was laid against him by Laodice, and Laodice was thrown <pb n="v.3.p.947"/> down a precipice, as Phylarchus relates in his twelfth book in
                  these words: “Danae was a chosen companion of Laodice, and was trusted by her with
                  all her secrets; and, being the daughter of that Leontium who had studied with
                  Epicurus the natural philosopher, and having been herself formerly the mistress of
                  Sophron, she, perceiving that Laodice was laying a plot to murder Sophron,
                  revealed the plot to Sophron by a sign. And he, understanding the sign, and
                  pretending to agree to what she was saying to him, asked two days to deliberate on
                  what he should do. And, when she had agreed to that, he fled away by night to
                  Ephesus. But Laodice, when she learnt what had been done by Danae, threw her down
                  a precipice, discarding all recollection of their former friendship. And they say
                  that Danae, when she perceived the danger which was impending over her, was
                  interrogated by Laodice, and refused to give her any answer; but, when she was
                  dragged to the precipice, then she said, that <quote>many people justly despise
                     the Deity, and they may justify themselves by my case, who having saved a man
                     who was to me as my husband, am requited in this manner by the Deity. But
                     Laodice, who murdered her husband, is thought worthy of such honour.</quote>

               <p>The same Phylarchus also speaks of Mysta, in his fourteenth book, in these terms:
                     <quote>Mysta was the mistress of Seleucus the king, and when Seleucus was
                     defeated by the Galatæ, and was with difficulty able to save himself by flight,
                     she put off the robes of a queen which she had been accustomed to wear, and
                     assumed the garment of an ordinary servant; and being taken prisoner, was
                     carried away with the rest of the captives. And being sold in the same manner
                     as her handmaidens, she came to Rhodes; and there, when she had revealed who
                     she was, she was sent back with great honour to Seleucus by the

                  Phila, Isthmias, and Neæra. But Neæra was the mistress of Stratoclides, and also
                  of Xenoclides the poet, and of Hipparchus the actor, and of Phrynion the Pæanian,
                  who was the son of Demon and the nephew of Demochares. And Phrynichus. and
                  Stephanus the orator used to have Neæra in turn, each a day, since their friends
                  had so arbitrated the matter for them; and the daughter of Neæra, whose name was
                  Strymbela, and who was afterwards called Phano, Stephanus gave (as if she had been
                  his own daughter) in marriage to Phrastor of Aegialea; as Demosthenes tells us in
                  his oration against Neæra. And he also speaks in the following manner about Sinope
                  the courtesan: <quote>And you punished Archias the hierophant, when he was
                     convicted before the regular tribunals of behaving with impiety, and offering
                     sacrifices which were contrary to the laws of the nation. And he was accused
                     also of other things, and among them of having sacrificed a victim on the
                     festival of Ceres, which was offered by Sinope the courtesan, on the altar
                     which is in the court of the temple at Eleusis, though it is against the law to
                     sacrifice any victims on that day; and though, too, it was no part of his duty
                     to sacrifice at all, but it belonged to the priestess to do so.</quote>

               <p>Plangon the Milesian was also a celebrated courtesan; and she, as she was most
                  wonderfully beautiful, was beloved by a young man of Colophon, who had a mistress
                  already whose name was Bacchis. Accordingly, when this young man began to address
                  his solicitations to Plangon, she, having heard of. the beauty of Bacchis, and
                  wishing to make the young man abandon his love for her, when she was unable to
                  effect that, she required as the price of her favours the necklace of Bacchis,
                  which was very celebrated. And he, as he was exceedingly in love, entreated
                  Bacchis not to see him totally overwhelmed with despair; and Bacchis, seeing the
                  excited state of the young man, gave him the necklace. And Plangon, when she saw
                  the freedom from jealousy which was exhibited by Bacchis, sent her back the
                  necklace, but kept the young man: and ever after Plangon and Bacchis were friends,
                  loving the young man in common; and the Ionians being amazed at this, as Menetor

               <p>That Menander the poet was a lover of Glycera, is notorious to everybody; but
                  still he was not well pleased with her. For when Philemon was in love with a
                  courtesan, and in one of his plays called her <quote>Excellent,</quote> Menander,
                  in one of his plays, said, in contradiction to this, that there was no courtesan

               <p> And Harpalus the Macedonian, who robbed Alexander of vast sums of money and then
                  fled to Athens, being in love with Pythionica, spent an immense deal of money on
                  her; and she was a courtesan. And when she died he erected a monument to her which
                  cost him many talents. And as he was carrying her out to burial, as Posidonius
                  tells us in the twenty-second book of his History, he had the body accompanied
                  with a band of the most eminent artists of all kinds, and with all sorts of
                  musical instruments and songs. And Dicæarchus, in his Essay on the Descent to the
                  Cave of Trophonius, says,—<quote>And that same sort of thing may happen to any one
                     who goes to the city of the Athenians, and who proceeds by the road leading
                     from Eleusis, which is called the Sacred Road; for, if he stops at that point
                     from which he first gets a sight of Athens, and of the temple, and of the
                     citadel, he will see a tomb built by the wayside, of such a size that there is
                     none other near which can be compared with it for magnitude. And at first, as
                     would be natural, he would pronounce it to be the tomb, beyond all question, of
                     Miltiades, or Cimon, or Pericles, or of some other of the great men of Athens.
                     And above all, he would feel sure that it had been erected by the city at the
                     public expense; or at all events by some public decree; and then, again, when
                     he heard it was the tomb of Pythionica the courtesan, what must be his
                     feelings?</quote>
               </p>
               <p>And Theopompus also, in his letter to Alexander, speaking reproachfully of the
                  profligacy of Harpalus, says,—<quote>But just consider and listen to the truth, as
                     you may hear from the people of Babylon, as to the manner in which he treated
                     Pythionica when she was dead; who was originally the slave of <pb n="v.3.p.950"/> Bacchis, the female flute-player. And Bacchis herself had
                     been the slave of Sinope the Thracian, who brought her establishment of harlots
                     from Aegina to Athens; so that she was not only trebly a slave, but also trebly
                     a harlot. He, however, erected two monuments to her at an expense exceeding two
                     hundred talents. And every one marvelled that no one of all those who died in
                     Cilicia, in defence of your dominions and of the freedom of the Greeks, had had
                     any tomb adorned for them either by him or by any other of the governors of the
                     state; but that a tomb should be erected to Pythionica the courtesan, both in
                     Athens and in Babylon; and they have now stood a long time. For a man who
                     ventured to call himself a friend to you, has dared to consecrate a temple and
                     a spot of ground to a woman whom everybody knew to have been common to every
                     one who chose at the same fixed price, and to call both the temple and the
                     altar those of Pythionica Venus; and in so doing, he despised also the
                     vengeance of the Gods, and endeavoured to insult the honours to which you are
                     entitled.</quote> Philemon also mentions these circumstances, in his comedy
                  called the Babylonian, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Pythionica and proud Harpalus.</l>

            <div type="chapter" n="68">
               <p>But after the death of Pythionica, Harpalus sent for Glycera, and she also was a
                  courtesan, as Theopompus relates, when he says that Harpalus issued an edict that
                  no one should present him with a crown, without at the same time paying a similar
                  compliment to his prostitute; and adds,— <quote>He has also erected a brazen
                     statue to Glycera in Rhossus of Syria, where he intends to erect one of you,
                     and another of himself. And he has permitted her to dwell in the palace in
                     Tarsus, and he permits her to receive adoration from the people, and to bear
                     the title of Queen, and to be complimented with other presents, which are only
                     fit for your own mother and your own wife.</quote> And we have a testimony
                  coinciding with this from the author of the Satyric drama called Agen, which was
                  exhibited, on the occasion when the Dionysian festival was celebrated on the banks
                  of the river Hydaspes, by the author, whether he was Pythen of Catana or
                  Byzantium, or the king himself. And it was exhibited when Harpalus was <pb n="v.3.p.951"/> now flying to the sea-shore, after he had revolted; and it
                  mentions Pythionica as already dead; and Glycera, as being with Harpalus, and as
                  being the person who encouraged the Athenians to receive presents from Harpalus.
                  And the verses of the play are as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> And the author of the play calls Harpalus Pallides in this passage; but

               <p>Naucratis also has produced some very celebrated courtesans of exceeding beauty;

                  accuses in her poetry of having stripped Charaxus of a great deal of his property.
                  But Herodots calls her Rhodopis, being evidently ignorant that Rhodopis and
                  Doricha were two different people; and it was Rhodopis who dedicated those

               <p>But in this Hermesianax is mistaken where he represents Sappho and Anacreon as
                  contemporaries. For the one lived in the time of Cyrus and Polycrates; but Sappho
                  lived in the reign of Alyattes, the father of Croesus. But Chameleon, in his
                  treatise on Sappho, does assert that some people say that these verses were made

                     <l>And will prefer a younger lover.</l>

               <p>But it is plain enough in reality that this piece of poetry is not Sappho's. And I
                  think myself that Hermesianax is joking concerning the love of Anacreon and
                  Sappho. For Diphilus the comic poet, in his play called Sappho, has represented
                  Archilochus and Hipponax as the lovers of Sappho.</p>
               <p>Now it appears to me, my friends, that I have displayed some diligence in getting
                  up this amorous catalogue for you, as I myself am not a person so mad about love
                  as Cynulcus, with his calumnious spirit, has represented me. I confess, indeed,
                  that I am amorous, but I do deny that I am frantic on the subject. <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Therefore I, considering that Love is a mighty and most powerful deity, and that

                  say— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And many men used to be as fond of having boys for their favourites as women for
                  their mistresses. And this was a frequent fashion in many very well regulated
                  cities of Greece. Accordingly, the Cretans, as I have said before, and the
                  Chalcidians in Eubœa, were very much addicted to the custom of having
                  boy-favourites. Therefore Echemens, in his History of Crete, says that it was not
                  Jupiter who carried off Ganymede, but Minos. But the before-mentioned Chalcidians
                  say that Ganymede was carried off from them by <pb n="v.3.p.960"/> Jupiter; and
                  they show the spot, which they call Harpagius;<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁρπάζω,</foreign> to carry
                     off.</note> and it is a place which produces extraordinary myrtles. And Minos
                  abandoned his enmity to the Athenians, (although it had originated in consequence
                  of the death of his son, out of his love for Theseus: and he gave his daughter
                  Phædra to him for his wife,) as Zenis, or Zeneus, the Chian, tells us in his
                  treatise on Country.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="78">
               <p>But Hieronymus the Peripatetic says that the ancients were anxious to encourage
                  the practice of having boy-favourites, because the vigorous disposition of youths,
                  and the confidence engendered by their association with each other, has often led
                  to the overthrow of tyrannies. For in the presence of his favourite, a man would
                  choose to do anything rather than to get the character of a coward. And this was
                  proved in practice in the case of the Sacred Band, as it was called, which was
                  established at Thebes by Epaminondas. And the death of the Pisistratidæ was
                  brought about by Harmodius and Aristogiton; and at Agrigentum in Sicily, the
                  mutual love of Chariton and Melanippus produced a similar result, as we are told
                  by Heraclides of Pontus, in his treatise on Amatory Matters. For Melanippus and
                  Chariton, being informed against as plotting against Phalaris, and being put to
                  the torture in order to compel them to reveal their accomplices, not only did not
                  betray them, but even made Phalaris himself pity them, on account of the tortures
                  which they had undergone, so that he dismissed them with great praise. On which
                  account Apollo, being pleased at this conduct, gave Phalaris a respite from death;
                  declaring this to the men who consulted the Pythian priestess as to how they might
                  best attack him. He also gave them an oracle respecting Chariton, putting the
                  Pentameter before the Hexameter, in the same way as afterwards Dionysius the
                  Athenian did, who was nicknamed the Brazen, in his Elegies; and the oracle runs as
                  follows— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Happy were Chariton and Melanippus,</l>
                     <l>Authors of heavenly love to many men.</l>

               <p>The circumstances, too, that happened to Cratinus the Athenian, are very
                  notorious. For he, being a very beautiful boy, at the time when Epimenides was
                  purifying Attica by human sacrifices, on account of some old pollution, as
                  Neanthes of Cyzicus relates in the second book of his treatise on <pb n="v.3.p.961"/> Sacrifices, willingly gave himself up to secure the safety of
                  the woman who had brought him up. And after his death, Apollodorus, his friend,
                  also devoted himself to death, and so the calamities of the country were
                  terminated. Ad owing to favouritism of this kind, the tyrants (for friendships of
                  this sort were very adverse to their interests) altogether forbad the fashion of
                  making favourites of boys, and wholly abolished it. And some of them even burnt
                  down and rased to the ground the palæstræ, considering them as fortresses hostile
                  to their own citadels; as, for instance, Polycrates the tyrant of Samos did.</p>

               <p>But I am not ignorant that the stories which are told about Cratinus and
                  Aristodemus are stated by Polemo Periegetes, in his Replies to Neanthes, to be all
                  mere inventions. But you, O Cynulcus, believe that all these stories are true, let
                  them be ever so false. And you take the greatest pleasure in all such poems as
                  turn on boys and favourite; of that kind; while the fashion of making favourites
                  of boys was first introduced among the Grecians from Crete, as Timæus informs us.
                  But others say that Laius was the originator of this custom, when he was received
                  in hospitality by Pelops; and that he took a great fancy to his son, Chrysipps,
                  whom he put into his chariot and carried off, and fled with to Thebes. But
                  Praxilla the Sicyonian says that Chrysippus was carried off by Jupiter. And the
                  Celtæ, too, although they have the most beautiful women of all the barbarians,
                  still make great favourites of boys . . . . . And the Persians, according to the
                  statement of Herodotus, learnt from the Greeks to adopt this fashion.</p>

               <p>Alexander the king was also very much in the habit <pb n="v.3.p.962"/> of giving
                  in to this fashion. Accordingly, Dicæarchus, in his treatise on the Sacrifice at
                  Troy, says that he was so much under the influence of Bagoas the eunuch, that he
                  embraced him in the sight of the whole theatre; and that when the whole theatre
                  shouted in approval of the action, he repeated it. And Carystius, in his Historic
                  Commentaries, says,—<quote>Charon the Chalcidian had a boy of great beauty, who
                     was a great favourite of his: but when Alexander, on one occasion, at a great
                     entertainment given by Craterus, praised this boy very much, Charon bade the
                     boy go and salute Alexander: and he said, 'Not so, for he will not please me so
                     much as he will vex you.' For though the king was of a very amorous
                     disposition, still he was at all times sufficiently master of himself to have a
                     due regard to decorum, and to the preservation of appearances. And in the same
                     spirit, when he had taken as prisoners the daughters of Darius, and his wife,
                     who was of extraordinary beauty, he not only abstained from offering them any
                     insult, but he took care never to let them feel that they were prisoners at
                     all; but ordered them to be treated in every respect, and to be supplied with
                     everything, just as if Darius had still been in his palace; on which account,
                     Darius, when he heard of this conduct, raised his hands to the Sun and prayed
                     that either he might be king, or Alexander.</quote>

               <p>But Ibycus states that Talus was a great favourite of Rhadamanthus the Just. And
                  Diotimus, in his Heraclea, says that Eurystheus was a great favourite of Hercules,
                  on which account he willingly endured all his labours for his sake. And it is said
                  that Argynnus was a favourite of Agamemnon; and that they first became acquainted
                  from Agamemnon seeing Argynnus bathing in the Cephisus. And afterwards, when he
                  was drowned in this river, (for he was continually bathing in it,) Agamemnon
                  buried him, and raised a temple on the spot to Venus Argynnis. But Licymnius of
                  Chios, in his Dithyrambics, says that it was Hymenæus of whom Argynnus was a
                  favourite. And Aristocles the harp-player was a favourite of King Antigonus: and
                  Antigonus the Carystian, in his Life of Zeno, writes of him in the following
                  terms: —<quote>Antigonus the king used often to go to sup with Zeno; and once, as

                  Sophocles the poet in Chios, when he was sailing to Lesbos as the general: he was
                  a man very pleasant over his wine, and very witty. And when Hermesilaus, who was
                  connected with him by ancient ties of hospitality, and who was also the

                     between two states, or between an individual or a family on the one hand, and a
                     whole state on the other . . . . When two states established public
                     hospitality, it was necessary that in each state persons should be appointed to
                     show hospitality to, and watch over the interests of all persons who came from
                     the state connected by hospitality. The persons who were appointed to this
                     office, as the recognised agents of the state for which they acted, were called

                        hereditary in a particular family. When a state appointed a proxenus, it
                        either sent out one of its own citizens to reside in the other state, or it
                        selected one of the citizens of the other, and conferred on him the honour
                        of proxenus . . . . This custom seems in later times to have been univer-
                        sally adopted by the Greeks. . . .</p>
                     <p>"The principal duties of a proxenus were to receive those persons,
                        especially ambassadors, who came from the state which he represented; to
                        procure for them admission to the assembly, and seats in the theatre; to act
                        as the patron of the strangers, and to mediate between the two states, if
                        any dispute arose. If a stranger died in the state, the proxenus of his
                        country had to take care of the property of the deceased. The proxenus
                        usually enjoyed exemption from taxes; and their persons were inviolable both

                  standing by the fire, being a boy of a very beautiful complexion, but made red by
                  the fire: so Sophocles called him and said, 'Do you wish me to drink with
                  pleasure? and when he said that he did, he said, 'Well, then, bring me the cup,
                  and take it away again in a leisurely manner.' And as the boy blushed all the more
                  at this, Sophocles said to the guest who was sitting next to him, 'How well did
                  Phrynichus speak when he said— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  mark of beauty. For if a painter were to cover the cheeks of this boy with purple
                  paint he would not be beautiful at all. And so it is not well to compare what is
                  beautiful with what is not so.' And on this Sophocles, laughing at the Eretrian,
                  said,—' Then, my friend, I suppose you are not pleased with the line in Simonides
                  which is generally considered among the Greeks to be a beautiful one— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  at this, the Eretrian was checked by the reproof; and Sophocles again turned to
                  pursue the conversation with the boy; for he asked him, as he was brushing away
                  the straws from the cup with his little finger, whether he saw any straws: and
                  when he said that he did, he said, 'Blow them away, then, that you may not dirty
                  your fingers.' And when he brought his face near the cup he held the cup nearer to
                  his own mouth, so as to bring his own head nearer to the head of the boy. And when
                  he was very near he took him by the hand and kissed him. And when all clapped
                  their hands, laughing and shouting out, to see how well he had taken the boy in,
                  he said, ' I, my friends, am meditating on the art of generalship, since Pericles
                  has said that I know how to compose poetry, but not how to be a general; now has
                  not this stratagem of mine succeeded perfectly?' And he both said and did many
                  things of this kind in a witty manner, drinking and giving himself up to mirth:
                  but as to political affairs he was not able nor energetic in them, but behaved as
                  any other virtuous Athenian might have done.</p>

               <p>Now I warn you, O philosophers, who indulge in unnatural passions, and who treat
                  the great goddess Venus with impiety, to beware, lest you be destroyed in the same
                  manner. For boys are only handsome, as Glycera the courtesan said, while they are
                  like women: at least, this is the saying attributed to her by Clearchus. But my
                  opinion is that the conduct of Cleonymus the Spartan was in strict conformity with
                  nature, who was the first man to take such hostages as he took from the
                  Metapontines—namely, two hundred of their most respectable and beautiful virgins;
                  as is related by Duris the Samian, in the third book of his History of Agathocles.

                  . . . . . . . . . . . . as Clearchus says. For a bull was excited by the sight of
                  the brazen cow at Pirene: and in a picture that existed of a bitch, and a pigeon,
                  and a goose; and a gander came up to the goose, and a dog to the bitch, and a male
                  pigeon to the pigeon, and not one of them discovered the deception till they got
                  close to them; but when they got near enough to touch them, they desisted; just as
                  Clisophus the Salymbrian did. For he fell in love with a statue of Parian marble
                  that then was at Samos, and shut himself up in the temple to gratify his
                  affection; but when he found that he could make no impression on the coldness and
                  unimpressibility of the stone, then he discarded his passion. And Alexis the poet
                  mentions this circumstance in his drama entitled The Picture, where he says—

                  it, and shut himself up with it, and presented it with a crown; but when he was
                  detected, the god ordered the Delphians, who consulted his oracle with reference
                  to the subject, to dismiss him freely, for that he had given him a handsome

               <p>And even brute beasts have fallen in love with men: for there was a cock who took
                  a fancy to a man of the name of Secundus, a cupbearer of the king; and the cock
                  was nicknamed the Centaur. But this Secundus was a slave of Nicomedes the king of
                  Bithynia; as Nicander informs us in the sixth book of his essay on the Revolutions
                  of Fortune. And, at Egium, a goose took a fancy to a boy; as Clearchus relates in
                  the first book of his Amatory Anecdotes. And Theophrastus, in his essay on Love,
                  says that the name of this boy was Amphilochus, and that he was a native of
                  Olenus. And Hermeas the son of Hermodorus, who was a Samian by birth, says that a
                  goose also took a fancy to Lacydes the philosopher. And in Leucadia according to a
                  story told by Clearchus), a peacock fell so in love with a maiden there, that when
                  she died, the bird died top. There is a story also that, at Iasus, a dolphin took
                  a fancy to a boy (and this story is told by Duris, in the ninth book of his
                  History); and the subject of that book is the history of Alexander, and the
                  historian's words are these: "He likewise sent for the boy from Iasus. For near
                  Iasus there was a boy whose name was Dionysius, and he once, when leaving the
                  palæstra with the rest of the boys, went down to the sea and bathed; and a dolphin
                  came forward out of the deep water to meet him, and taking him on his back, swam
                  sway with him a considerable distance into the open sea, and then brought him back
                  again to land." But the dolphin is an animal which is very fond of men, and very
                  intelligent, and one very susceptible of gratitude. Accordingly Phylarchus, in his
                  twelfth book, says—<quote>Coiranus the Milesian, when he saw some fishermen who
                     had caught a dolphin in a net, and who <pb n="v.3.p.968"/> were about to cut
                     it up, gave them some money and bought the fish, and took it down and put it
                     back in the sea again. And after this it happened to him to be shipwrecked near
                     Myconos, and while every one else perished, Coiranus alone was saved by a
                     dolphin. And when, at last, he died of old age in his native country, as it so
                     happened that his funeral procession passed along the sea-shore close to
                     Miletus, a great shoal of dolphins appeared on that day in the harbour, keeping
                     only a very little distance from those who were attending the funeral of
                     Coiranus, as if they also were joining in the procession and sharing in their
                     grief.</quote>

               <p>The same Phylarchus also relates, in the twentieth book of his History, the great
                  affection which was once displayed by an elephant for a boy. And his words are
                  these: <quote>But there was a female elephant kept with this elephant, and the
                     name of the female elephant was Nicæa; and to her the wife of the king of
                     India, when dying, entrusted her child, which was just a month old. And when
                     the woman did die, the affection for the child displayed by the beast, was most
                     extraordinary; for it could not endure the child to be away; and whenever it
                     did not see him, it was out of spirits. And so, whenever the nurse fed the
                     infant with milk, she placed it in its cradle between the feet of the beast;
                     and if she had not done so, the elephant would not take any food; and after
                     this, it would take whatever reeds and grass there were near, and, while the
                     child was sleeping, beat away the flies with the bundle. And whenever the child
                     wept, it would rock the cradle with its trunk, and lull it to sleep. And very
                     often the male elephant did the same.</quote>

                  Banquets, says loudly,—“It is a very consistent subject of conversation at
                  drinking-parties for men to talk of amatory matters; for we are naturally inclined

                  those who go to excess in it, and behave in a beastly manner. But if logicians,
                  when assembled in a social party, were to talk about syllogisms, then a man might
                  very fairly think that they were acting very unseasonably. And a <pb n="v.3.p.969"/> respectable and virtuous man will at times get drunk; but they
                  who wish to appear extraordinarily temperate, keep up this character amid their
                  cups for a certain time, but afterwards, as the wine begins to take effect on
                  them, they descend to every kind of impropriety and indecency. And this was the
                  case very lately with the ambassadors who came to Antigonus from Arcadia; for they
                  sat at dinner with great severity of countenance, and with great propriety, as
                  they thought,- not only not looking at any one of us, but not even looking at one
                  another. But as the wine went round, and music of different kinds was introduced,
                  and when the Thessalian dancing-women, as their fashion is, came in, and danced
                  quite naked, except that they had girdles round their waists, then the men could
                  not restrain themselves any longer, but jumped up off the couches, and shouted as
                  if they were beholding a most gratifying sight; and they congratulated the king
                  because he had it in his power to indulge in such pastimes; and they did and said
                  a great many more vulgar things of the same kind.</p>
               <p>"And one of the philosophers who was once drinking with us, when a flute-playing
                  girl came in, and when there was plenty of room near him, when the girl wished to
                  sit down near him, would not allow her, but drew himself up and looked grave. And
                  then afterwards, when the girl was put up to auction, as is often the fashion at
                  such entertainments, he was exceedingly eager to buy her, and quarrelled with the
                  man who sold her, on the ground that he had knocked her down too speedily to some
                  one else; and he said that the auctioneer had not fairly sold her. And at last his
                  grave philosopher, he who at first would not permit the girl even to sit near him,
                  came to blows about her." And perhaps this very philosopher, who came to blows
                  about the flute-playing girl, may have been Persæus himself; for Antinus the
                  Carystian, in his treatise on Zeno, makes the following statement:—<quote>Zeno the
                     Cittiæan, when once Persæus and a drinking-party bought a flute-playing girl,
                     and after that was afraid to bring her home, because he lived in the same house
                     with Zeno, becoming acquainted with the circumstance, brought the girl home
                     himself, and shut her up with Persæus.</quote> I know, also, that Polystratus
                  the Athenian, who was a pupil of Theophrastus, and who was surnamed the <pb n="v.3.p.970"/> Tyrrhenian, used often to put on the garments of the female
                  flute-players.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="87">
               <p> Kings, too, have shown great anxiety about musical women; as Parmenion tells us
                  in his Letter to Alexander, which he sent to that monarch after he had taken
                  Damascus, and after he had become master of all the baggage of Darius.
                  Accordingly, having enumerated all the things which he had taken, he writes as
                     follows:—<quote>I found three hundred and twenty-nine concubines of the king,
                     all skilled in music; and forty-six men who were skilful in making garlands,
                     and two hundred and seventy-seven confectioners, and twenty-nine boilers of
                     pots, and thirteen cooks skilful in pre- paring milk, and seventeen artists who
                     mixed drinks, and seventy slaves who strain wine, and forty preparers of
                     perfumes.</quote> And I say to you, O my companions, that there is no sight
                  which has a greater tendency to gladden the eyes than the beauty of a woman.
                  Accordingly Œneus, in the play of Chæremon the tragedian, speaking of some maidens
                  whom he had seen, says, in the play called Œneus,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And one did lie with garment well thrown back,</l>

                     <l>Another, as she lightly danced, display'd</l>
                     <l>The fair proportions of her lefthand side,</l>
                     <l>Naked-a lovely picture for the air</l>

                     <l>Strove with the darkening shades. Another bared</l>
                     <l>Her lovely arms and taper fingers all:</l>
                     <l>Another, with her robe high round her neck,</l>

               <p>Now there have been many women celebrated for their beauty (for, as Euripides
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>E'en an old bard may sing of memory)</l>
                  </quote> There was, for instance, Thargelia the Milesian, who was married to
                  fourteen different husbands, so very beautiful and accomplished was she, as
                  Hippias the Sophist says, in his book which is entitled Synagoge. But Dinon, in
                  the fifth book of his History of Persia, and in the first part of it, says that
                  the wife of Bagazus, who was a sister of Xerxes by the same father, (and her name
                  was Anytis,) was the most beautiful and the most licentious of all the woman in
                  Asia. And Phylarchus, in his nineteenth book, says that Timosa, the concubine of
                  Oxyartes, surpassed all women in beauty, and that the king of Egypt had originally
                  sent her as a present to Statira, the wife of the king.</p>
               <p>And Theopompus, in the fifty-sixth book of his History, speaks of Xenopithea, the
                  mother of Lysandrides, as the most beautiful of all the women in Peloponnesus. And
                  the Lacedæmonians put her to death, and her sister Chryse also, when Agesilaus the
                  king, having raised a seditious tumult in the city, procured Lysandrides, who was
                  his enemy, to be banished by the Lacedæmonians. Pantica of Cyprus was <pb n="v.3.p.972"/> also a very beautiful woman; and she is mentioned by
                  Phylarchus, in the tenth book of his History, where he says that when she was with
                  Olympias, the mother of Alexander, Monimus, the son of Pythion, asked her in
                  marriage. And, as she was a very licentious woman, Olympias said to him— <quote>O
                     wretched man, you are marrying with your eyes, and not with your
                     understanding.</quote> They also say that the woman who brought back
                  Pisistratus to assume the tyranny, clad in the semblance of Minerva the Saviour,
                  was very beautiful, as indeed she ought to have been, seeing that she assumed the
                  appearance of a goddess. And she was a seller of garlands; and Pisistratus
                  afterwards gave her in marriage to Hipparchus his son, as Clidemus relates in the
                  eighth book of his Returns, where he says—-<quote>And he also gave the woman, by
                     name Phya, who had been in the chariot with him, in marriage to his son
                     Hipparchus. And she was the daughter of a man named Socrates. And he took for
                     Hippias, who succeeded him in the tyranny, the daughter of Charmus the
                     polemarch, who was extraordinarily beautiful.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>And it happened, as it is said, that Charmus was a great admirer of Hippias, and
                  that he was the man who first erected a statue of Love in the Academy, on which
                  there is the following inscription— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>O wily Love, Charmus this altar raised</l>
                     <l>At the well-shaded bounds of her Gymnasium.</l>
                  </quote> Hesiod, also, in the third book of his Melampodia, calls Chalcis in
                  Eubœa, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Land of fair women;—</l>
                  </quote> for the women there are very beautiful, as Theophrastus also asserts. And
                  Nymphodorus, in his Voyage round Asia, says that there are nowhere more beautiful
                  women than those in Tenedos, an island close to Troy.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="90">
               <p>I am aware, too, that on one occasion there was a contest of beauty instituted
                  among women. And Nicias, speaking of it in his History of Arcadia, says that
                  Cypselus instituted it, having built a city in the plain which is watered by the
                  Alpheus; in which he established some Parrhasians, and consecrated a plot of
                  sacred ground and an altar to Ceres of Eleusis, in whose festival it was that he
                  had instituted this contest of beauty. And he says that the woman who gained the
                  victory in this contest was Herodice. And <pb n="v.3.p.973"/> even to this day
                  this contest is continued; and the women who contend in it are called Goldbearing.
                  And Theophrastus says that there is also a contest of beauty which takes place
                  among the Eleans, and that the decision is come to with great care and
                  deliberation; and that those who gain the victory receive arms as their prize,
                  which Dionysius of Leuctra says are offered up to Minerva. And he says, too, that
                  the victor is adorned with fillets by his friends, and goes in procession to the
                  temple; and that a crown of myrtle is given to him (at least this is the statement
                  of Myrsilus, in his Historical Paradoxes). <quote>But in some places,</quote> says
                  the same Theophrastus, <quote>there are contests between the women in respect of
                     modesty and good management, as there are among the barbarians; and at other
                     places also there are contests about beauty, on the ground that this also is
                     entitled to honour, as for instance, there are in Tenedos and Lesbos. But they
                     say that this is the gift of chance, or of nature; but that the honour paid to
                     modesty ought to be one of a greater degree. For that it is in consequence of
                     modesty that beauty is beautiful; for without modesty it is apt to be subdued
                     by intemperance.</quote>

                  calculated to overwhelm the hearers than to do them any good? And if any one were
                  to inquire of you, who they were who were shut up in the wooden horse, you would
                  perhaps be able to tell the names of one or two; and even this you would not do
                  out of the verses of Stesichorus, (for that could hardly be,) but out of the
                  Storming of Troy, by Sacadas the Argive; for he has given a catalogue of a great
                  number of names. Nor indeed could you properly <pb n="v.3.p.974"/> give a list of

                  flute-players. And Myrtilus said,—But where has Phylarchus stated this For I have

                  corrupting the youth of the city, though, at a subsequent time, somehow or other,

                  profitless discussions to which they give rise; owing to which it was that,
                  Socrates was put to death; he, who argued <pb n="v.3.p.975"/> against the judges
                  who were given him by lot, discoursing of justice to them when they were a pack of
                  most corrupt men. And it is owing to this, too, that Theodorus the Atheist was put
                  to death, and that Diagoras was banished; and this latter, sailing away when he
                  was banished, was wrecked. But Theotimus, who wrote the books against Epicurus,
                  was accused by Zeno the Epicurean, and put to death; as is related by Demetrius
                  the Magnesian, in his treatise in People and Things which go by the same Name.</p>

               <p>And, in short, according to Clearchus the Solensian, you do not adopt a manly
                  system of life, but you do really aim at a system which might become a dog; but
                  although this animal has four excellent qualities, you select none but the worst
                  of his qualities for your imitation. For a dog is a wonderful animal as to his
                  power of smelling and of distinguishing what belongs to his own family and what
                  does not; and the way in which he associates with man and the manner in which he
                  watches over and protects the houses of all those who are kind to him, is
                  extraordinary. But you who imitate the dogs, do neither of these things. For you
                  do not associate with men, nor do you distinguish, between those with whom you are
                  acquainted; and being very deficient in sensibility, you live in an indolent and
                  indifferent manner. But while the dog is also a snarling and greedy animal, and
                  also hard in his way of living, and naked; these habits of his you practise, being
                  abusive and gluttonous, and, besides all this, living without a home or a hearth.
                  The result of all which circumstances is, that you are destitute of virtue, and
                  quite unserviceable for any useful purpose in life. For there is nothing less
                  philosophical than those persons who are called philosophers. For whoever supposed
                  that Aeschines, the pupil of Socrates, would have been such a man in his manners
                  as Lysias the orator, in his speeches on the Contracts, represents him to have
                  been; when, out of the dialogues which are extant, and generally represented to be
                  his work, we are inclined to admire him as an equitable and moderate man? unless,
                  indeed, those writings are in reality the work of the wise Socrates, and were
                  given to Aeschines by Xanthippe, the wife of Socrates, after his death, which
                  Idomeneus asserts to be the case.</p>

               <p>But Lysias, in the oration which bears this title— <pb n="v.3.p.976"/>
                  <quote>Against Aeschines, the Pupil of Socrates, for Debt,</quote> (for I will
                  recite the passage, even though it be a rather long one, on account of your
                  excessive arrogance, O philosophers,)— begins in the following manner—<quote>I
                     never should have imagined, O judges, that Aeschines would have dared to come
                     into court on a trial which is so discreditable to him. For a more
                     disgracefully false accusation than the one which he has brought forward, I do
                     not believe it to be easy to find. For he, O judges, owing a sum of money with
                     a covenanted interest of three drachmæ to Sosinomus the banker and Aristogiton,
                     came to me, and besought me not to allow him to be wholly stripped of his own
                     property, in consequence of this high interest. ' And I,' said he, am at this
                     moment carrying on the trade of a perfumer; but I want capital to go on with,
                     and I will pay you nine<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">This would have
                        been 18 per cent. Three drachmæ were about 36 per cent. The former appears
                        to have been the usual rate of interest at Athens in the time of Lysias; for
                        we find in Demosthenes that interest <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ

                        mina lent, was considered low. It was exceedingly common, however, among the
                        money-lenders, to exact an exorbitant rate of interest, going even as high
                        as a drachma every four days.—See Smith's Dict. Ant. v. <hi rend="italics">Interest,</hi> p. 524.</note> obols a month interest.</quote> A fine end
                  to the happiness of this philosopher was the trade of a perfumer, and admirably
                  harmonizing with the philosophy of Socrates, a man who utterly rejected the use of
                  all perfumes and unguents! And moreover, Solon the lawgiver expressly forbade a
                  man to devote himself to any such business: on which account Pherecrates, in his
                  Oven, or Woman sitting up all Night, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Why should he practise a perfumer's trade,</l>
                     <l>Sitting beneath a high umbrella there,</l>
                     <l>Preparing for himself a seat on which</l>
                     <l>To gossip with the youths the whole day long?</l>
                  </quote> And presently afterwards he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And no one ever saw a female cook</l>
                     <l>Or any fishwoman; for every class</l>
                     <l>Should practise arts which are best suited to it.</l>
                  </quote> And after what I have already quoted, the orator proceeds to
                     say—<quote>And I was persuaded by this speech of his, considering also that
                     this Aeschines had been the pupil of Socrates, and was a man who uttered fine
                     sentiments about <pb n="v.3.p.977"/> virtue and justice, and who would never
                     attempt nor venture on the actions practised by dishonest and unjust
                     men.</quote>

            <div type="chapter" n="95">
               <p>And after this again, after he had run through the accusation of Aeschines, and
                  had explained how he had bor- rowed the money, and how he never paid either
                  interest or principal, and how, when an action was brought against him, he had
                  allowed judgment to go by default, and how a branded slave of his had been put
                  forward by him as security; and after he had brought a good many more charges of
                  the same kind against him, he thus proceeded:—“But, O judges, I am not the only
                  person to whom he behaves in this manner, but he treats every one who has any
                  dealings with him in the same manner. Are not even all the wine-sellers who live
                  near him, from whom he gets wine for his entertainments and never pays for it,
                  bringing actions against him, having already closed their shops against him? And
                  his neighbours are ill- treated by him to such a degree that they leave their own
                  houses, and go and rent others which are at a distance from him. And with respect
                  to all the contributions which he collects, he never himself puts down the
                  remaining share which is due from him, but all the money which ever gets into this
                  pedlar's hands is lost as if it were utterly destroyed. And such a number of men
                  come to his house daily at dawn, to ask for their money which he owes them, that
                  passers-by suppose he must be dead, and that such a crowd can only be collected to
                  attend his funeral.</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>And those men who live in the Piræus have such an opi- nion of him, that
                     they think it a far less perilous business to sail to the Adriatic than to deal
                     with him; for he thinks that all that he can borrow is much more actually his
                     own thin what his father left him. Has he not got possession of the property of
                     Hermæus the perfumer, after having seduced his wife, though she was seventy
                     years old? whom he pretended to be in love with, and then treated in such a
                     manner that she reduced her husband and her sons to beggary, and made him a
                     per- fumer instead of a pedlar! in so amorous a manner did he handle the
                     damsel, enjoying the fruit of her youth, when it would have been less trouble
                     to him to count her teeth than the fingers of her hand, they were so much fewer

                  music, and also jesters and buffoons, let us have a little talk about them.
                  Although I am aware that Anacharsis the Scythian, when on one occasion jesters
                  were introduced in his company, remained without moving a muscle of his
                  countenance; but afterwards, when a monkey was brought in, he burst out laughing,
                  and said, <quote>Now this fellow is laughable by his nature, but man is only so
                     through practice.</quote> And Euripides, in his Melanippe in Chains, has said—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But many men, from the wish to raise a laugh,</l>

               </p>
               <p>And Parmeniscus of Metapontum, as Semus tells us in the fifth book of his Delias,
                  a man of the highest consideration both as to family and in respect of his riches,
                  having gone down to the cave of Trophonius, after he had come up again, was not
                  able to laugh at all. And when he consulted the oracle on this subject, the
                  Pythian priestess replied to him— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>You're asking me, you laughless man,</l>
                     <l>About the power to laugh again;</l>

                     <l>If you with reverence to her come.</l>
                  </quote> So, on this, he hoped that when he returned to his country he should be
                  able to laugh again; but when he found that he could laugh no more now than he
                  could before, he considered that he had been deceived; till, by some chance, he
                  came to Delos; and as he was admiring everything he saw in the island, he came
                  into the temple of Latona, expecting to see some very superb statue of the mother
                  of Apollo; but when he saw only a wooden shapeless figure, he unexpectedly burst
                  out laughing. And then, comparing what had happened with the oracle of the god,
                  and being cured of his infirmity, he honoured the goddess greatly.</p>

               <p>Xenophon also, in his Banquet, mentions jesters; introducing Philip, of whom he
                  speaks in the following manner: —<quote>But Philip the jester, having knocked at
                     the door, told the boy who answered, to tell the guests who he was, and that he
                     was desirous to be admitted; and he said that he came provided with everything
                     which could qualify him for supping at other people's expense. And he said,
                     too, that his boy was in a good deal of distress because he had brought
                     nothing, and because he had had no dinner.</quote> And Hippolochus the
                  Macedonian, in his epistle to Lynceus, mentions the jesters Mandrogenes and Strato
                  the Athenian. And at Athens there was a great deal of this kind of cleverness.
                  Accordingly, in the Heracleum at Diomea<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diomea was a small village in Attica, where there was a celebrated temple of
                     Hercules, and where a festival was kept in his honour: Aristophanes says—

                  Callimedon, nicknamed the Crab, and Dinias, and also Mnasigeiton and Menæchmus, as
                  Telephanes tells us in his treatise on the City. And their reputation for amusing
                  qualities was so great, that Philip the Macedonian heard of it, and sent them a
                  talent to engage them to write out their witticisms and send them to him. And the
                  fact of this king having been a man who was very fond of jokes is testified to us

               <p>And we have mentioned before this that Sylla, the general of the Romans, was very
                  fond of anything laughable. And Lucius Anicius, who was also a general of the
                  Romans, after he had subdued the Illyrians, and brought with him Genthius the king
                  of the Illyrians as his prisoner, with all his children, when he was celebrating
                  his triumphal games at Rome, did many things of the most laughable character
                  possible, as Polybius relates in his thirtieth book:—<quote>For having sent for
                     the most eminent artists from Greece, and having erected a very large theatre
                     in the circus, he first of all introduced all the flute-players. And these were
                     Theodorus the Bœotian, and Theopompus, and Hermippus, surnamed Lysimachus, who
                     were the most eminent men in their profession. And having brought these men in
                     front of the stage after the chorus was over, he ordered them all to play the
                     flute. And as they accompanied their music with appropriate gestures, he sent
                     to them and said that they were not playing well, and desired them to be more
                     vehement. And while they were in perplexity, one of the lictors told them that
                     what Anicius wished was that they should turn round so as to advance towards
                     each other, and give a representation of a battle. And then the flute-players,
                     taking this hint, and adopting a movement not unsuited to their habitual
                     wantonness, caused a great tumult and confusion; and turning the middle of the
                     chorus towards the extremities, the flute-players, all blowing unpremeditated
                     notes, and letting their flutes be all out of tune, rushed upon one another in
                     turn: and at the same time the choruses, all making a noise to correspond to
                     them, and coming on the stage at the same time, rushed also upon one another,
                     and then again retreated, advancing and retreating alternately. But when one of
                     the chorus-dancers tucked up his garment, and suddenly turned round and raised
                     his hands against the flute-player who was coming towards him, as if he was
                     going to box with him, then there arose an extraordinary <pb n="v.3.p.982"/>
                     clapping and shouting on the part of the spectators. And while all these men
                     were fighting as if in regular battle, two dancers were introduced into the
                     orchestra with a symphony, and four boxers mounted the stage, with trumpeters
                     and horn-players: and when all these men were striving together, the spectacle
                     was quite indescribable: and as for the tragedians,</quote> says Polybius,
                     <quote>if I were to attempt to describe what took place with respect to them, I
                     should be thought by some people to be jesting.</quote>

               <p>Now when Ulpian had said thus much, and when all were laughing at the idea of this
                  exhibition of Anicius, a discussion arose about the men who are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλάνοι.</foreign> And the question was asked, Whether there was
                  any mention of these men in any of the ancient authors? for of the jugglers

                  Magnus said,— Dionysius of Sinope, the comic poet, in his play entitled the

                  </quote> There was also a man named Pantaleon, who is mentioned by Theognetus, in

                  </quote> And Chrysippus the philosopher, in the fifth book of his treatise on

               <p>And our party was not deficient in men fond of raising a laugh by bitter speeches.
                  And respecting a man of this kind, Chrysippus subsequently, in the same book,
                  writes as follows:—<quote>Once when a man fond of saying bitter things was about
                     to be put to death by the executioner, he said that he wished to die like the

                  Myrtilus having had a good many jokes cut on him by people of this sort, got
                  angry, and said that Lysimachus the king had done a very sensible thing; for he,
                  hearing Telesphorus, one of his lieutenants, at an entertainment, ridiculing
                  Arsinoe (and she was the wife of Lysimachus), as being a woman in the habit of
                  vomiting, in the following line— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  word <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλεάγρα,</foreign> it occurs in Hyperides the orator;
                  and the passage you may find out for yourself.</p>
               <p>And Tachaos the king of Egypt ridiculed Agesilaus king of Lacedæmon, when he came
                  to him as an ally (for he was a very short man), and lost his, kingdom in
                  consequence, as Agesilaus abandoned his alliance. And the expression of Tachaos
                  was as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The mountain was in labour; Jupiter</l>
                     <l>Was greatly frighten'd: lo! a mouse was born.</l>
                  </quote> And Agesilaus hearing of this, and being indignant at it, said, <quote>I
                     will prove a lion to you.</quote> So afterwards, when the Egyptians revolted
                  (as Theopompus relates, and Lyceas of Naucratis confirms the statement in his
                  History of Egypt), Agesilaus refused to cooperate with him, and, in consequence,
                  Tachaos lost his kingdom, and fled to the Persians.</p>

               <p>So as there was a great deal of music introduced, and not always the same

                  them, (without always giving the names of those who took part in it,) I will
                  enumerate the chief things which were said. For concerning <pb n="v.3.p.984"/>
                  flutes, somebody said that Melanippides, in his Marsyas, dis- paraging the art of
                  playing the flute, had said very cleverly about Minerva:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Minerva cast away those instruments</l>
                     <l>Down from her sacred hand; and said, in scorn,</l>
                     <l>"Away, you shameful things—you stains of the body!</l>
                     <l>Shall I now yield myself to such malpractices'"</l>
                  </quote> And some one, replying to him, said,—But Telestes of Selinus, in
                  opposition to Melanippides, says in his Argo (and it is of Minerva that he too is
                  speaking):— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>It seems to me a scarcely credible thing</l>
                     <l>That the wise Pallas, holiest of goddesses,</l>
                     <l>Should in the mountain groves have taken up</l>
                     <l>That clever instrument, and then again</l>
                     <l>Thrown it away, fearing to draw her mouth</l>
                     <l>Into an unseemly shape, to be a glory</l>
                     <l>To the nymph-born, noisy monster Marsyas.</l>
                     <l>For how should chaste Minerva be so anxious</l>
                     <l>About her beauty, when the Fates had given her</l>
                     <l>A childless, husbandless virginity?</l>
                  </quote> intimating his belief that she, as she was and always was to continue a
                  maid, could not be alarmed at the idea of disfiguring her beauty. And in a
                  subsequent passage he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But this report, spread by vain-speaking men,</l>
                     <l>Hostile to every chorus, flew most causelessly</l>
                     <l>Through Greece, to raise an envy and reproach</l>
                     <l>Against the wise and sacred art of music.</l>
                  </quote> And after this, in an express panegyric on the art of flute-playing, he

                  </quote> And very neatly, in his Aesculapius, has Telestes vindicated the use of

               <p>And of the union of flutes with the lyre (for that concert has often been a great
                  delight to us ourselves), Ephippus, in his Traffic, speaks as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Clearly, O youth, the music of the flute,</l>
                     <l>And that which from the lyre comes, does suit</l>

                     <l>Then is the greatest pleasure felt by all.</l>
                  </quote> And the exact meaning of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναυλία</foreign> is shown by Semus the Delian, in the fifth book of his
                  Delias, where he writes—<quote>But as the term 'concert' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συναυλία</foreign>) is not understood by many people, we must speak of it.
                     It is wren there is a union of the flute and of rhythm in alternation, without
                     any words accompanying the melody.</quote> And Antiphanes explains it very
                  neatly in his Flute-player, where he says— <pb n="v.3.p.986"/>

                  as Duris remarks in the second book of his History of Agathocles, because
                  Seirites, who appears to have been the first inventor of the art of flute-playing,
                  was a Libyan, of one of the Nomad tribes; and he was the first person who played
                  airs on the flute in the festival of Cybele." And the different kinds of airs
                  which can be played on the flute (as Tryphon tells us in the second book of his
                  treatise on Names) have the following names:—the Comus, the Bucoliasmus, the
                  Gingras, the Tetracomus, the Epiphallus, the Choreus, the Callinicus, the Martial,
                  the Hedycomus, the Sicynnotyrbe, the Thyrocopicum, which is the same as the
                  Crousithyrum (or Door-knocker), the Cnismus, the Mothon. And all these airs on the
                  flute, when played, were accompanied with dancing.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="10">
               <p>Tryphon also gives a list of the different names of songs, as follows. He
                  says—"There is the Himæus, which is also called the Millstone song, which men used
                  to sing while grinding corn, perhaps from the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμαλίς.</foreign>. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμαλίς</foreign> is a Dorian
                  word, signifying a return, and also the quantity of corn which the millers gave
                  into the bargain. Then there is the Elinus, which is the song of the men who
                  worked at the loom; as Epicharmus shows us in his Atalantas. There is also the
                  Ioulos, sung by the women who spin. And Semus the Delian, in his treatise on
                  Pæans, says—'"They used to call the handfuls of barley taken separately, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμάλαι;</foreign> but when they were collected so that a great
                  many were made into one sheaf, then they were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔλοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴουλοι.</foreign>. And Ceres herself
                  was called sometimes Chloe, and sometimes Ioulo; and, as being the inventions of
                  this goddess, both the fruits of the ground and also the songs addressed to the
                  goddess were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖλοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴουλοι</foreign>: and so, too, we have the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημήτρουλοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλλίουλοι,</foreign> and the line— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     </l>
                  </quote> But others say that the Ioulis is the song of the workers in <pb n="v.3.p.987"/> wool. There are also the songs of nurses, which are called
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταβαυκαλήσεις.</foreign> There was also a song used at
                  the feast of Swings,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">There is no account
                     of what this feast of Swings was. The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔωραι.</foreign> Some have fancied it may have had some connexion with the
                     images of Bacchus (oscilla) hung up in the trees. See Virg. G. ii. 389.</note>
                  in honour of Erigone, which is called Aletis. At all events, Aristotle says, in
                  his treatise on the Constitution of the Colophonians—<quote>Theodorus also himself
                     died afterwards by a violent death. And he is said to have been a very
                     luxurious man, as is evident from his poetry; for even now the women sing his
                     songs on the festival of the Swing.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>There was also a reaper's song called Lityerses; and another song sung by hired
                  servants when going to the fields, as Teleclides tells us in his Amphictyons.
                  There were songs, too, of bathing men, as we learn from Crates in his Deeds of
                  Daring; and a song of women baking, as Aristophanes intimates in his
                  Thesmophoriazusæ, and Nicochares in his Hercules Choregus. And another song in use
                  among those who drove herds, and this was called the Bucoliasmus. And the man who
                  first invented this species of song was Diomus, a Sicilian cowherd; and it is
                  mentioned by Epicharmus in his Halcyon, and in his Ulysses Shipwrecked. The song
                  used at deaths and in mourning is called Olophyrmus; and the songs called Iouli
                  are used in honour of Ceres and Proserpine. The song sung in honour of Apollo is
                  called Philhelias, as we learn from Telesilla; and those addressed to Diana are
                  called Upingi.</p>
               <p>There were also laws composed by Charondas, which were sung at Athens at
                  drinking-parties; as Hermippus tells us in the sixth book of his treatise on
                  Lawgivers. And Aristophanes, in his catalogue of Attic Expressions, say—<quote>The
                     Himæus is the song of people grinding; the Hymenæus is the song used at
                     marriage-feasts; and that employed in lamentation is called Ialemus. But the
                     Linus and the Aelinus are not confined to occasions of mourning, but are in use
                     also in good fortune, as we may gather from Euripides.</quote>

            <div type="chapter" n="11">
               <p>But Clearchus, in the first book of his treatise on matters relating to Love, says
                  that there was a kind of song called Nomium, derived from Eriphanis; and his words
                  are these:—"Eriphanis was a lyric poetess, the mistress of Menalcas the hunter;
                  and she, pursuing him with her passions, hunted too. For often frequenting the
                  mountains, and <pb n="v.3.p.988"/> wandering over them, she came to the different
                  groves, equal- ling in her wanderings the celebrated journeys of Io; so that not
                  only those men who were most remarkable for their deficiency in the tender
                  passion, but even the fiercest beasts, joined in weeping for her misfortunes,
                  perceiving the lengths to which her passionate hopes carried her. Therefore she
                  wrote poems; and when she had composed them, as it is said, she roamed about the
                  desert, shouting and singing the kind of song called Nomium, in which the burden
                  of the song is— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The lofty oaks, Menalcas."</l>
                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>And Aristoxenus, in the fourth book of his treatise on Music,
                     says—<quote>Anciently the women used to sing a kind of song called Calyca. Now,
                     this was a poem of Stesichorus, in which a damsel of the name of Calyca, being
                     in love with a young man named Euathlus, prays in a modest manner to Venus to
                     aid her in becoming his wife. But when the young man scorned her, she threw
                     herself down a precipice. And this disaster took place near Leucas. And the
                     poet has represented the disposition of the maiden as very modest; so that she
                     was not willing to live with the youth on his own terms, but prayed that, if
                     possible, she might become the wedded wife of Euathlus; and if that were not
                     possible, that she might be released from life.</quote> But, in his Brief
                  Memoranda, Aristoxenus says—<quote>Iphiclus despised Harpalyce, who was in love
                     with him; but she died, and there has been a contest established among the
                     virgins of songs in her honour, and the contest is called from her,
                     Harpalyce.</quote> And Nymphis, in the first book of his History of Heraclea,
                  speaking of the Maryandyni, says—<quote>And in the same way it is well to notice
                     some songs which, in compliance with a national custom, they sing, in which
                     they invoke some ancient person, whom they address as Bormus. And they say that
                     he was the son of an illustrious and wealthy man, and that he was far superior
                     to all his fellows in beauty and in the vigour of youth; and as he was
                     superintending the cultivation of some of his own lands, and wishing to give
                     his reapers something to drink, he went to fetch some water, and disappeared.
                     Accordingly, they say that on this the natives of the country sought him with a
                     kind of dirge and invocation set to music, which even to this day they are in
                     the habit of using frequently. And a <pb n="v.3.p.989"/> similar kind of song
                     is that which is in use among the Egyp- tians, and is called Maneros.</quote>

               <p>Moreover, there were rhapsodists also present at our entertainments: for
                  Laurentius delighted in the reciters of Homer to an extraordinary degree; so that
                  one might call Cassander the king of Macedonia a trifler in comparison of him;
                  concerning whom Carystius, in his Historic Recollections, tells us that he was so
                  devoted to Homer, that he could say the greater part of his poems by heart; and he
                  had a copy of the Iliad and the Odyssey written out with his own hand. And that
                  these reciters of Homer were called Homeristæ also, Aristocles has told us in his
                  treatise on Choruses. But those who are now called Homeristæ were first introduced
                  on the stage by Demetrius Phalereus.</p>
               <p>Now Chamæleon, in his essay on Stesichorus, says that not only the poems of Homer,
                  but those also of Hesiod and Archilochus, and also of Mimnermus and Phocylides,
                  were often recited to the accompaniment of music; and Clearchus, in the first book
                  of his treatise on Pictures, says—<quote>Simonides of Zacynthus used to sit in the
                     theatres on a lofty chair reciting the verses of Archilochus.</quote> And
                  Lysanias, in the first book of his treatise on Iambic Poets, says that Mnasion the
                  rhapsodist used in his public recitations to deliver some of the Iambics of
                  Simonides. And Cleomenes the rhapsodist, at the Olympic games, recited the
                  Purification of Empedocles, as is asserted by Dicæarchus in his history of
                  Olympia. And Jason, in the third book of his treatise on the Temples of Alexander,
                  says that Hegesias, the comic actor, recited the works of Herodotus in the great
                  theatre, and that Hermophantus recited the poems of Homer.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="13">
               <p>And the men called Hilarodists (whom some people at the present day call
                  Simodists, as Aristocles tells us in his first book on Choruses, because Simus the
                  Magnesian was the most celebrated of all the poets of joyous songs,) frequently
                  come under our notice. And Aristocles also gives a regular list of them in his
                  treatise on Music, here he speaks in the following manner:—<quote>The Magodist—but
                     he is the same as the Lysiodist.</quote> But Aristoxenus says that Magodus is
                  the name given to an actor who acts both male and female characters;<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">There is probably some corruption in this
                     passage: it is clearly unintelligible as it stands.</note> but that he who acts
                  a woman's part in <pb n="v.3.p.990"/> combination with a man's is called a
                  Lysiodist. And they both sing the same songs, and in other respects they are
                  similar.</p>
               <p>The Ionic dialect also supplies us with poems of Sotades, and with what before his
                  time were called Ionic poems, such as those of Alexander the Aetolian, and Pyres
                  the Milesian, and Alexas, and other poets of the same kind; and Sotades is called
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιναιδόλογος.</foreign> And Sotades the Maronite was very
                  notorious for this kind of poetry, as Carystius of Pergamus says in his essay on
                  Sotades; and so was the son of Sotades, Apollonius: and this latter also wrote an
                  essay on his father's poetry, from which one may easily see the unbridled licence
                  of language which Sotades allowed himself,—abusing Lysimachus the king in
                  Alexandria,—and, when at the court of Lysimachus, abusing Ptolemy
                  Philadelphus,-and in different cities speaking ill of different sovereigns; on
                  which account, at last, he met with the punishment that he deserved: for when he
                  had sailed from Alexandria (as Hegesander, in his Reminiscences, relates), and
                  thought that he had escaped all danger, (for he had said many bitter things
                  against Ptolemy the king, and especially this, after he had heard that he had
                  married his sister Arsinoe,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>He pierced forbidden fruit with deadly sting,)</l>
                  </quote> Patrocles, the general of Ptolemy, caught him in the island of Caunus,
                  and shut him up in a leaden vessel, and carried him into the open sea and drowned
                  him. And his poetry is of this kind: Philenus was the father of Theodorus the
                  fluteplayer, on whom he wrote these lines:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And he, opening the door which leads from the back-street,</l>
                     <l>Sent forth vain thunder from a leafy cave,</l>
                     <l>Such as a mighty ploughing ox might utter.</l>

            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="14">
               <p>But the Hilarodus, as he is called, is a more respectable kind of poet than these
                  men are; for he is never effeminate or indecorous, but he wears a white manly
                  robe, and he is crowned with a golden crown: and in former times he used to wear
                  sandals, as Aristocles tells us; but at the present day he wears only slippers.
                  And some man or woman sings an accompaniment to him, as to a person who sings to
                  the flute. And a crown is given to a Hilarodus, as well as to a person who sings
                  to the flute; but such honours are not allowed to a player on the harp or on the
                  flute. But the man who is called a Magodus has drums and cymbals, and wears all
                  kinds <pb n="v.3.p.991"/> of woman's attire; and he behaves in an effeminate
                  manner, and does every sort of indecorous, indecent thing,—imitating at one time a
                  woman, at another an adulterer or a pimp: or sometimes he represents a drunken
                  man, or even a serenade offered by a reveller to his mistress. And Aristoxeus says
                  that the business of singing joyous songs is a respectable one, and somewhat akin
                  to tragedy; but that the business of a Magodus is more like comedy. And very often
                  it happens that the Magodi, taking the argument of some comedy, represent it
                  according to their own fashion and manner. And the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαγῳδία</foreign> was derived from the fact that those who addicted themselves
                  to the practice, uttered things like magical incantations, and often declared the
                  power of various drugs.</p>

                  imitated persons stealing fruit, or else some foreign physician speaking in this
                  way, as Allexis, in his Woman who has taken Mandragora, represents one: and he

                  and skill in everything that related to music. He once came late to one of our
                  banquets, and when he heard from one of the servants that we had all finished
                  supper, he doubted what to do himself, until Sophon the cook came to him, and with
                  a loud voice, so that every one might hear, recited to him these lines out of the

                  softens those who are passionate and quarrelsome in their tempers. Accordingly,

                     when people asked him the reason of this conduct, he used to say, 'I am
                     pacifying myself.' And so, too, the Achilles of Homer was mollified by the

               <p>Now, that music can heal diseases, Theophrastus asserts in his treatise on
                  Enthusiasm, where he says that men with diseases in the loins become free from
                  pain if any one plays a Phrygian air opposite to the part affected. And the
                  Phrygians are the first people who invented and employed the harmony which goes by
                  their name; owing to which circumstance it is that the flute-players among the
                  Greeks have usually Phrygian and servile-sounding names, such as Sambas in Aleman,
                  and Adon, and Telus. And in Hipponax we find Cion, and Codalus, and Babys, from
                  whom the proverb arose about men who play worse and worse,—<quote>He plays worse
                     than Babys.</quote> But Aristoxenus ascribes the invention of this harmony to
                  Hyagnis the Phrygian.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="19">
               <p>But Heraclides of Pontus, in the third book of his treatise on Music, says—"Now
                  that harmony ought not to be called Phrygian, just as it has no right either to be
                  called Lydian. For there are three harmonies; as there are also three different
                  races of Greeks-Dorians, Aeolians, and] Ionians: and accordingly there is no
                  little difference between their manners. The Lacedæmonians are of all the Dorians
                  the most strict in maintaining their national customs and the Thessalians (and
                  these are they who were the origin of the <pb n="v.3.p.996"/> Aeolian race) have
                  preserved at all times very nearly the same customs and institutions; but the
                  population of the Ionians has been a great deal changed, and has gone through many
                  transitions, because they have at all times resembled whatever nations of
                  barbarians have from time to time been their masters. Accordingly, that species of
                  melody which the Dorians composed they called the Dorian harmony, and that which
                  the Aeolians used to sing they named the Aeolian harmony, and the third they
                  called the Ionian, because they heard the Ionians sing it.</p>
               <p>"Now the Dorian harmony is a manly and high-sounding strain, having nothing
                  relaxed or merry in it, but, rather, it is stern and vehement, not admitting any
                  great variations or any sudden changes. The character of the Aeolian harmony is
                  pompous and inflated, and full of a sort of pride; and these characteristics are
                  very much in keeping with the fondness for breeding horses and for entertaining
                  strangers which the people itself exhibits. There is nothing mean in it, but the
                  style is elevated and fearless; and therefore we see that a fondness for banquets
                  and for amorous indulgences is common to the whole nation, and they indulge in
                  every sort of relaxation: on which account they cherish the style of the
                  Sub-Dorian harmony; for that which they call the Aeolian is, says Heraclides, a
                  sort of modification of the Dorian, and is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποδώριος.</foreign>. And we may collect the character of this Aeolian harmony
                  also from what Lasus of Hermione says in his hymn to the Ceres in Hermione, where
                  he speaks as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I sing the praise of Ceres and of Proserpine,</l>
                     <l>The sacred wife of Clymenus, Melibœa;</l>
                     <l>Raising the heavy-sounding harmony</l>
                     <l>Of hymns Aeolian.</l>
                  </quote> But these Sub-Dorian songs, as they are called, are sung by nearly
                  everybody. Since, then, there is a Sub-Dorian melody, it is with great propriety
                  that Lasus speaks of Aeolian harmony. Pratinas, too, somewhere or other says—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Aim not at too sustain'd a style, nor yet</l>
                     <l>At the relax'd Ionian harmony;</l>
                     <l>But draw a middle furrow through your ground,</l>
                     <l>And follow the Eolian muse in preference.</l>
                  </quote> And in what comes afterwards he speaks more plainly—- <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But to all men who wish to raise their voices,</l>
                     <l>The Aeolian harmony's most suitable.</l>
                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.3.p.997"/> "Now formerly, as I have said, they used to call this the
                  Aeolian harmony, but afterwards they gave it the name of the Sub-Dorian, thinking,
                  as some people say, that it was pitched lower on the flute than the Dorian. But it
                  appears to me that those who gave it this name, seeing its inflated style, and the
                  pretence to valour and virtue which was put forth in the style of the harmony,
                  thought it not exactly the Dorian harmony, but to a certain extent like it: on
                  which account they called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποδώριον,</foreign> just as
                  they call what is nearly white <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόλευκον</foreign>: and what
                  is not absolutely sweet, but something near it, we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόγλυκυ;</foreign> so, too, we call what is not thoroughly Dorian <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόδωριον.</foreign>

            <div type="chapter" n="20">
               <p>"Next in order let us consider the character of the Milesians, which the Ionians
                  display, being very proud of the goodly appearance of their persons; and full of
                  spirit, hard to be reconciled to their enemies, quarrelsome, displaying no
                  philanthropic or cheerful qualities, but rather a want of affection and
                  friendship, and a great moroseness of disposition: on which account the Ionian
                  style of harmony also is not flowery nor mirthful, but austere and harsh, and
                  having a sort of gravity in it, which, however, is not ignoble-looking; on which
                  account that tragedy has a sort of affection for that harmony. But the manners of
                  the Ionians of the present day are more luxurious, and the character of their
                  present music is very far removed from the Ionian harmony we have been speaking
                  of. And men say that Pythermus the Teian wrote songs such as are called Scolia in
                  this kind of harmony; and that it was because he was an Ionian poet that the
                  harmony got the name of Ionian. This is that Pythermus whom Ananius or Hipponax
                  mentions in his Iambics in this way:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Pythermus speaks of gold as though all else were nought.</l>
                  </quote> And Pythermus's own words are as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>All other things but gold are good for nothing.</l>
                  </quote> Therefore, according to this statement, it is probable that Pythermus, as
                  coming from those parts. adapted the character of his melodies to the disposition
                  of the Ionians; on which account I suppose that his was not actually the Ionian
                  harmony, but that it was a harmony adapted in some a admirable manner to the
                  purpose required. And those are contemptible <pb n="v.3.p.998"/> people who are
                  unable to distinguish the characteristic differences of these separate harmonies;
                  but who are led away by the sharpness or flatness of the sounds, so as to describe
                  one harmony as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερμιξολύδιος,</foreign> and then again to
                  give a definition of some further sort, refining on this: for I do not think that
                  even that which is called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερφρύγιος</foreign> has a
                  distinct character of its own, although some people do say that they have invented
                  a new harmony which they call Sub-Phrygian (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποφρύγιος</foreign>). Now every kind of harmony ought to have some distinct
                  species of character or of passion; as the Locrian has, for this was a harmony
                  used by some of those who lived in the time of Simonides and Pindar, but
                  subsequently it fell into contempt.</p>

               <p>"There are, then, as we have already said, three kinds of harmony, as there are
                  three nations of the Greek people. But the Phrygian and Lydian harmonies, being
                  barbaric, became known to the Greeks by means of the Phrygians and Lydians who
                  came over to Peloponnesus with Pelops. For many Lydians accompanied and followed
                  him, because Sipylus was a town of Lydia; and many Phrygians did so too, not
                  because they border on the Lydians, but because their king also was Tantalus—(and
                  you may see all over Peloponnesus, and most especially in Lacedæmon, great mounds,
                  which the people there call the tombs of the Phrygians who came over with
                  Pelops)—and from them the Greeks learnt these harmonies: on which account Telestes
                  of Selinus says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  <quote>But we must not admit,</quote> says Polybius of Megalopolis, "that music,
                  as Ephorus asserts, was introduced among men for the purposes of fraud and
                  trickery. Nor must we think that the ancient Cretans and Lacedæmonians used flutes
                  and songs at random to excite their military ardour, instead of trumpets. Nor are
                  we to imagine that the earliest Arcadians had no reason whatever for doing so,
                  when they introduced music into every department of their management of the
                  republic; so that, though the nation in every other respect was most austere in
                  its manner of life, they nevertheless com- <pb n="v.3.p.999"/> pelled music to be
                  the constant companion, not only of their boys, but even of their youths up to
                  thirty years of age. For the Arcadians are the only people among whom the boys are
                  trained from infancy to sing hymns and pæans to regular airs, in which indeed
                  every city celebrates their national heroes and gods with such songs, in obedience
                  to ancient custom.</p>
               <p>"But after this, learning the airs of Timotheus and Philoxenus, they every year,
                  at the festival of Bacchus, dance in their theatres to the music of flute-players;
                  the boys dancing in the choruses of boys, and the youths in those of men. And
                  throughout the whole duration of their lives they are addicted to music at their
                  common entertainments; not so much, however, employing musicians as singing in
                  turn: and to admit themselves ignorant of any other accomplishment is not at all
                  reckoned discreditable to them; but to refuse to sing is accounted a most
                  disgraceful thing. And they, practising marches so as to march in order to the
                  sound of the flute, and studying their dances also, exhibit every year in the
                  theatres, under public regulations and at the public expense. These, then, are the
                  customs which they have derived from the ancients, not for the sake of luxury and
                  superfluity, but from a consideration of the austerity which each individual
                  practised in his private life, and of the severity of their characters, which they
                  contract from the cold and gloomy nature of the climate which prevails in the
                  greater part of their country. And it is the nature of all men to be in some
                  degree influenced by the climate, so as to get some resemblance to it themselves;
                  and it is owing to this that we find different races of men, varying in character
                  and figure and complexion, in proportion as they are more or less distant from one
                  another.</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>In addition to this, they instituted public banquets and public sacrifices,
                     in which the men and women join; and also dances of the maidens and boys
                     together; endevouring to mollify and civilize the harshness of their nature
                     character by the influence of education and habit. And as the people of Cynætha
                     neglected this system (although they occupy by far the most inclement district
                     of Arcadia, both as respects the soil and the climate), they, never meeting one
                     another except for the purpose of giving offence and quarrelling, became at

                     prevailed among them alone of all the people of Arcadia; and at the time when
                     they made the great massacre, whatever Arcadian cities their emissaries came to
                     in their passage, the citizens of all the other cities at once ordered them to
                     depart by public proclamation; and the Mantineans even made a public

                  the greatest of all civil virtues, and they attributed the greatest importance to
                  that, to the exclusion of other good qualities. Archilochus accordingly, who was a

                  </quote> as if this art of music were welcome also to men feasting.</p>
               <p>Now it was, as it should seem, a regular custom to introduce music, in the first
                  place in order that every one who might be too eager for drunkenness or gluttony
                  might have music as a sort of physician and healer of his insolence and indecorum,
                  and also because music softens moroseness of temper; for it dissipates sadness,
                  and produces affability and a sort of gentlemanlike joy. From which consideration,
                  Homer has also, in the first book of the Iliad, represented the gods as using
                  music after their dissensions on the subject of Achilles; for they continued for
                  some time listening to it— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> For it was desirable that they should leave off their quarrels and
                  dissensions, as we have said. And most people seem to attribute the practice of
                  this art to banquets for the sake of setting things right, and of the general
                  mutual advantage. And, besides these other occasions, the ancients also
                  established by customs and laws that at feasts all men should sing hymns to the
                  gods, in order by these means to preserve <pb n="v.3.p.1002"/> order and decency
                  among us; for as all songs proceed according to harmony, the consideration of the
                  gods being added to this harmony, elevates the feelings of each individual. And
                  Philochorus says that the ancients, when making their libations, did not always
                  use dithyrambic hymns, but <quote>when they pour libations, they celebrate Bacchus
                     with wine and drunkenness, but Apollo with tranquillity and good order.</quote>
                  Accordingly Archilochus says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I, all excited in my mind with wine,</l>
                     <l>Am skilful in the dithyrambic, knowing</l>
                     <l>The noble melodies of the sovereign Bacchus.</l>
                  </quote> And Epicharmus, in his Philoctetes, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>A water-drinker knows no dithyrambics.</l>
                  </quote> So, that it was not merely with a view to superficial and vulgar
                  pleasure, as some assert, that music was originally introduced into
                  entertainments, is plain from what has been said above. But the Lacedæmonians do
                  not assert that they used to learn music as a science, but they do profess to be
                  able to judge well of what is done in the art; and they say that they have already
                  three times preserved it when it was in danger of being lost.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="25">
               <p>Music also contributes to the proper exercising of the body and to sharpening the
                  intellect; on which account, every Grecian people, and every barbarian nation too,
                  that we are acquainted with, practise it. And it was a good saying of Damon the
                  Athenian, that songs and dances must inevitably exist where the mind was excited
                  in any manner; and liberal, and gentlemanly, and honourable feelings of the mind
                  produce corresponding kinds of music, and the opposite feelings likewise produce
                  the opposite kinds of music. On which account, that saying of Clisthenes the
                  tyrant of Sicyon was a witty one, and a sign of a well-educated intellect. For
                  when he saw, as it is related,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">This story
                     is related by Herodotus, vi. 126.</note> one of the suitors for his daughter
                  dancing in an unseemly manner (it was Hippoclides the Athenian), he told him that
                  he had danced away his marriage, thinking, as it should seem, that the mind of the
                  man corresponded to the dance which he had exhibited; for in dancing and walking
                  decorum and good order are honourable, and disorder and vulgarity are
                  discreditable. And it is on this principle that the poets originally arranged
                  dances for <pb n="v.3.p.1003"/> freeborn men, and employed figures only to be
                  emblems of what was being sung, always preserving the principles of nobleness and
                  manliness in them; on which account it was that they gave them the name of
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπορχήματα</foreign>(accompaniment to the dance). And if
                  any one, while dancing indulged in unseemly postures or figures, and did nothing
                  at all corresponding to the songs sung, he was considered blameworthy; on which
                  account, Aristophanes or Plato, in his Preparations (as Chamæleon quotes the
                  play), spoke thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>So that if any one danced well, the sight</l>
                     <l>Was pleasing: but they now do nothing rightly,</l>
                     <l>But stand as if amazed, and roar at random.</l>
                  </quote> For the kind of dancing which was at that time used in the choruses was
                  decorous and magnificent, and to a certain extent imitated the motions of men
                  under arms; on which account Socrates in his Poems says that those men who dance
                  best are the best in warlike exploits; and thus he writes:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But they who in the dance most suitably</l>
                     <l>Do honour to the Gods, are likewise best</l>
                     <l>In all the deeds of war.</l>
                  </quote> For the dance is very nearly an armed exercise, and is a dis- play not
                  only of good discipline in other respects, but also of the care which the dancers
                  bestow on their persons.</p>

               <p>And Amphion the Thespiæan, in the second book of his treatise on the Temple of the
                  Muses on Mount Helicon, says that in Helicon there are dances of boys, got up with
                  great care, quoting this ancient epigram:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I both did dance, and taught the citizens</l>

               </p>
               <p>And it was a good answer which was made by Caphesias the flute-player, when one of
                  his pupils began to pay on the flute very loudly, and was endeavouring to play as
                  loudly as he could; on which he struck him, and said, <quote>Goodness does not
                     consist in greatness, but greatness in goodness</quote> There are also relics
                  and traces of the ancient dancing in some statues which we have, which were made
                  by ancient statuaries; on which account men at that time paid more attention to
                  moving their hands with graceful gestures; for in his parti- <pb n="v.3.p.1004"/>
                  cular also they aimed at graceful and gentlemanlike motions, comprehending what
                  was great in what was well done. And from these motions of the hands they
                  transferred some figures to the dances, and from the dances to the palæstra; for
                  they sought to improve their manliness by music and by paying attention to their
                  persons. And they practised to the accompaniment of song with reference to their
                  movements when under arms; and it was from this practice that the dance called the
                  Pyrrhic dance originated, and every other dance of this kind, and all the others
                  which have the same name or any similar one with a slight change: such as the
                  Cretan dances called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρσίτης</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικρήδιος;</foreign> and that dance, too, which is named <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόκινος,</foreign> (and it is mentioned under this name by
                  Cratinus in his Nemesis, and by Cephisodorus in his Amazons, and by Aristophanes
                  in his Centaur, and by several other poets,) though afterwards it came to be
                  called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μακτρισμός;</foreign> and many women used to dance

               <p>But the more sedate kinds of dance, both the more varied kinds and those too whose
                  figures are more simple, are the following:—The Dactylus, the Iambic, the
                  Molossian, the Emmelea, the Cordax, the Sicinnis, the Persian, the Phrygian, the
                  Nibatismus, the Thracian, the Calabrismus, the Telesias (and this is a Macedonian
                  dance which Ptolemy was practising when he slew Alexander the brother of Philip,
                  as Marsyas relates in the third book of his History of Macedon). The following
                  dances are of a frantic kind:—The Cernophorus, and the Mongas, and the
                  Thermaustris. There was also a kind of dance in use among private individuals,
                  called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθεμα,</foreign> and they used to dance this
                  while repeating the following form of words with a sort of mimicking gesture,
                  saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

               </p>
               <p>Among the Syracusans there was a kind of dance called the Chitoneas, sacred to
                  Diana, and it is a peculiar kind of dance, accompanied with the flute. There was
                  also an Ionian kind of dance practised at drinking parties. They also practised
                  the dance called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγγελικὴ</foreign> at their drinking
                  parties. And there is another kind of dance called the Burning of the <pb n="v.3.p.1005"/> World, which Menippus the Cynic mentions in his Banquet.
                  There are also some dances of a ridiculous character:—the Igdis, the Mactrismus,
                  the Apocinus, and the Sobas; and besides these, the Morphasmus, and the Owl, and
                  the Lion, and the Pouring out of Meal, and the Abolition of Debt, and the
                  Elements, and the Pyrrhic dance. And they also lanced to the accompaniment of the
                  flute a dance which they called the Dance of the Master of the Ship, and the
                  Platter Dance.</p>
               <p>The figures used in dances are the Xiphismus, the Calathismus, the Callabides, the
                  Scops, and the Scopeuma. And the Scops was a figure intended to represent people
                  looking out from a distance, making an arch over their brows with their hand so as
                  to shade their eyes. And it is mentioned by Aeschylus in his Spectators:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Calathiscus, the Strobilus. There is also a dance called the Telesias; and this is
                  a martial kind of dance, deriving its title from a man of the name of Telesias,
                  who was the first person who ever danced it, holding arms in his hands, as
                  Hippagoras tells us in the first book of his treatise on the Constitution of the
                  Carthaginians.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="28">
               <p>There is also a kind of satyric dance called the Sicinnis, as Aristocles says in
                  the eighth book of his treatise on Dances; and the Satyrs are called Sicinnistæ.
                  But some say that a barbarian of the name of Sicinnus was the inventor of it,
                  though others say that Sicinnus was a Cretan by birth; and certainly the Cretans
                  are dancers, as is mentioned by Aristoxenus. But Scamon, in the first book of his
                  treatise on Inventions, says that this dance is called Sicinnis, from being shaken
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ σείεσθαι</foreign>), and that Thersippus was the
                  first person who danced the Sicinnis. Now in dancing, the motion of the feet was
                  adopted long before any motion of the lands was considered requisite; for the
                  ancients exercised their feet more than their hands in games and in hunting; and
                  the Cretans are <pb n="v.3.p.1006"/> greatly addicted to hunting, owing to which
                  they are swift of foot. But there are people to be found who assert that Sicinnis
                  is a word formed poetically from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνησις,</foreign>
                  <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνησις,</foreign>, motion.</note> because in dancing it
                  the Satyrs use most rapid movements; for this kind of dance gives no scope for a
                  display of the passions, on which account also it is never slow.</p>
               <p>Now all satyric poetry formerly consisted of choruses, as also did tragedy, such
                  as it existed at the same time; and that was the chief reason why tragedy had no
                  regular actors. Arid there are three kinds of dance appropriate to dramatic
                  poetry, —the tragic, the comic, and the satyric; and in like manner, there are
                  three kinds of lyric dancing,—the pyrrhic the gymnopædic, and the hyporchematic.
                  And the pyrrhic dance resembles the satyric; for they both consist of rapid
                  movements; but the pyrrhic appears to be a warlike kind of dance, for it is danced
                  by armed boys. And men in war have need of swiftness to pursue their enemies, and
                  also, when defeated, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>To flee, and not like madmen to stand firm,</l>
                     <l>Nor be afraid to seem a short time cowards.</l>
                  </quote> But the dance called Gymnopædica is like the dance in tragedy which is
                  called Emmelea; for in each there is seen a degree of gravity and solemnity. But
                  the hyporchematic dance is very nearly identical with the comic one which is
                  called Cordax. And they are both a sportive kind of figure.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="29">
               <p>But Aristoxenus says that the Pyrrhic dance derives its name from Pyrrhichus, who
                  was a Lacedæmonian by birth; and that even to this day Pyrrhichus is a
                  Lacedæmonian name. And the dance itself, being of a warlike character, shows that
                  it is the invention of some Lacedæmonian; for the Lacedæmonians are a martial
                  race, and their sons learn military marches which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνόπλια.</foreign> And the Lacedæmonians themselves in their wars recite the
                  poems of Tyrtæus, and move in time to those airs. But Philochorus asserts that the
                  Lacedæmonians, when owing to the generalship of Tyrtæus they had subdued the
                  Messenians, introduced a regular custom in their expeditions, that whenever they
                  were at supper, and had sung the pæan, they should also sing one of Tyrtæus's
                  hymns as a solo, one after another; and that the polemarch should be the judge,
                  and should give a piece of meat as a prize to him who sang best. But the Pyrrhic
                  dance is not <pb n="v.3.p.1007"/> preserved now among any other people of Greece;
                  and since that has fallen into disuse, their wars also have been brought to a
                  conclusion; but it continues in use among the Lacedæmonians alone, being a sort of
                  prelude preparatory to war: and all who are more than five years old in Sparta
                  learn to dance the Pyrrhic dance.</p>
               <p>But the Pyrrhic dance as it exists in our time, appears to be a sort of Bacchic
                  dance, and a little more pacific than the old one; for the dancers carry thyrsi
                  instead of spears, and they point and dart canes at one another, and carry
                  torches. And they dance in figures having reference to Bacchus, and to the
                  Indians, and to the story of Pentheus: and they require for the Pyrrhic dance the
                  most beautiful airs, and what are called the <quote>stirring</quote> tunes.</p>

               <p>But the Gymnopædica resembles the dance which by the ancients used to be called
                  Anapale; for all the boys dance naked, performing some kind of movement in regular
                  time, and with gestures of the hand like those used by wrestlers: so that the
                  dancers exhibit a sort of spectacle akin to the palestra and to the pancratium,
                  moving their feet in regular time. And the different modes of dancing it are
                  called the Oschophoricus,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="grc">θ̓́σχη,</foreign>, a vine-branch with grapes on it, and
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρω,</foreign> to bear.</note> and the Bacchic, so
                  that this kind of dance, too, has some reference to Bacchus. But Aristoxenus says
                  that the ancients, after they had exercised themselves in the Gymnopædica, turned
                  to the Pyrrhic dance before they entered the theatre: and the Pyrrhic dance is
                  also called the Cheironomia. But the Hyporchematic dance is that in which the
                  chorus dances while singing. Accordingly Bacchylides says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There's no room now for sitting down,</l>
                     <l>There's no room for delay.</l>
                  </quote> And Pindar says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The Lacedæmonian troop of maidens fair.</l>
                  </quote> And the Lacedæmonians dance this dance in Pindar. And the Hyporchematica
                  is a dance of men and women. Now the best modes are those which combine dancing
                  with the singing; and they are these-the Prosodiacal, the Apostolical (which last
                  is also called (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρθένιος</foreign>), and others of the same
                  kind. And some danced to the hymn and some did not; and some danced in
                  accompaniment to hymns to Venus and Bacchus, and to the Pæan, dancing at one time
                  and resting at another. And <pb n="v.3.p.1008"/> among the barbarians as well as
                  among the Greeks there are respectable dances and also indecorous ones. Now the
                  Cordax among the Greeks is an indecorous dance, but the Emmelea is a respectable
                  one: as is among the Arcadians the Cidaris, and among the Sicyonians the Aleter;
                  and it is called Aleter also in Ithaca, as Aristoxenus relates in the first book
                  of his History of Sicyon. And this appears enough to say at present on the subject
                  of dances.</p>

               <p> Now formerly decorum was carefully attended to in music, and everything in this
                  art had its suitable and appropriate ornament: on which account there were
                  separate flutes for each separate kind of harmony; and every flute-player had
                  flutes adapted to each kind of harmony in their contests. But Pronomus the Theban
                  was the first man who played the three different kinds of harmony already
                  mentioned on the same flute. But now people meddle with music in a random and
                  inconsiderate manner. And formerly, to be popular with the vulgar was reckoned a
                  certain sign of a want of real skill: on which account Asopodorus the Phliasian,
                  when some flute-player was once being much applauded while he himself was
                  remaining in the hyposcenium,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">It is not
                     known what part of the theatre this was.</note> said—<quote>What is all this?
                     the man has evidently committed some great blunder:</quote>—as else he could
                  not possibly have been so much approved of by the mob. But I am aware that some
                  people tell this story as if it were Antigenides who said this. But in our days
                  artists make the objects of their art to be the gaining the applause of the
                  spectators in the theatre; on which account Aristoxenus, in his book entitled
                  Promiscuous Banquets, says— <quote>We act in a manner similar to the people of
                     Pæstum who dwell in the Tyrrhenian Gulf; for it happened to them, though they
                     were originally Greeks, to have become at last completely barbarised, becoming
                     Tyrrhenians or Romans, and to have changed their language, and all the rest of
                     their national habits. But one Greek festival they do celebrate even to the
                     present day, in which they meet and recollect all their ancient names and
                     customs, and bewail their loss to one another, and then, when they have wept
                     for them, they go home. And so,</quote> says he, <quote>we also, since the
                     theatres have become completely barbarised, and since music has become entirely
                     ruined and vulgar, we, being but a few, will recal to <pb n="v.3.p.1009"/> our
                     minds, sitting by ourselves, what music once was.</quote> And this was the
                  discourse of Aristoxenus.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="32">
               <p>Wherefore it seems to me that we ought to have a philosophical conversation about
                  music: for Pythgoras the Samian, who had such a high reputation as a philbsopher,
                  is well known, from many circumstances, to have been a man who had no slight or
                  superficial knowledge of music; for he indeed lays it down that the whole universe
                  is put and kept together by music. And altogether the ancient philosophy of the
                  Greeks appears to have been very much addicted to music; and on this account they
                  judged Apollo to have been the most musical and the wisest of the gods, and
                  Orpheus of' the demigods. And they called every one who devoted himself to the
                  study of this art a sophist, as Aeschylus does in the verse where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And then the sophist sweetly struck the lyre.</l>
                  </quote> And that the ancients were excessively devoted to the study of music is
                  plain from Homer, who, because all his own poetry was adapted to music, makes,
                  from want of care, so many verses which are headless, and weak, and imperfect in
                  the tail. But Xenophobes, and Solon, and Theognis, and Phocylides, and besides
                  them Periander of Corinth, an elegiac poet, and the rest of those who did not set
                  melodies to their poems, compose their verses with reference to number and to the
                  arrangement of the metres, and take great care that none of their verses shall be
                  liable to the charge of any of the irregularities which we just now imputed to
                  Homer. Now when we call a verse headless (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκέφαλος</foreign>), we mean such as have a mutilation or lameness at the

               <p>But of all the Greeks, the Lacedæmonians were those who preserved the art of music
                  most strictly, as they applied themselves to the practice a great deal: and there
                  were a great many lyric poets among them. And even to this day they preserve their
                  ancient songs carefully, being possessed of very varied and very accurate learning
                  on the subject; on which account Pratinas says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The Lacedæmonian grasshopper sweetly sings,</l>
                     <l>Well suited to the chorus.</l>
                  </quote> And on this account the poets also continually styled their odes— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>President of sweetest hymns:</l>
                  </quote> and— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The honey-wing'd melodies of the Muse.</l>
                  </quote> For owing to the general moderation and austerity of their lives, they
                  betook themselves gladly to music, which has a sort of power of soothing the
                  understanding; so that it was natural enough that people who hear it should be
                  delighted. And the people whom they called Choregi, were not, as Demetrius of
                  Byzantium tells us in the fourth book of his treatise on Poetry, those who have
                  that name now, the people, that is to say, who hire the choruses, but those who
                  actually led the choruses, as the name intimates: and so it happened, that the
                  Lacedæmonians were good musicians, and did not violate the ancient laws of
                  music.</p>
               <p>Now in ancient times all the Greeks were fond of music; but when in subsequent
                  ages disorders arose, when nearly all the ancient customs had got out of fashion
                  and had become obsolete, this fondness for music also wore out, and bad styles of
                  music were introduced, which led all the composers to aim at effeminacy rather
                  than delicacy, and at an enervated and dissolute rather than a modest style. And
                     <pb n="v.3.p.1011"/> perhaps this will still exist hereafter in a greater
                  degree, and will extend still further, unless some one again draws forth the
                  national music to the light. For formerly the subjects of their songs used to be
                  the exploits of heroes, and the praises of the Gods; and accordingly Homer says of
                  Achilles— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  his history of Persia. Accordingly, the poets used to celebrate the valour of the
                  elder Cyrus, and they foresaw the war which was going to be waged against
                  Astyages. <quote>For when,</quote> says he, <quote>Cyrus had begun his march

                     Astyages was sitting at a banquet with his friends, then a man, whose name was
                     Angares, (and he was the most illustrious of his minstrels,) being called in,
                     sang other things, such as were customary, and at last he said that— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     Persian.' And so the king, thinking that his suspicions were well founded, sent
                     people to recal Cyrus, but did not succeed in doing so.</quote>

               <p>After this there arose a discussion about the sambuca. And Masurius said that the
                  sambuca was a musical instrument, very shrill, and that it was mentioned by
                  Euphorion (who is also an Epic poet), in his book on the Isthmian Games; for he
                  says that it was used by the Parthians and by the Troglodytæ, and that it had four
                  strings. He said also that it was mentioned by Pythagoras, in his treatise on the
                  Red Sea. The sambuca is also a name given to an engine used in sieges, the form
                  and mechanism of which is explained by Biton, in his book addressed to Attalus on
                  the subject of Military Engines. And Andreas of Panormus, in the thirty-third book
                  of his History of Sicily, detailed city by city, says that it is borne against the
                  walls of the enemy on two cranes. And it is called sambuca because when it is
                  raised up it gives a sort of appearance of a ship and ladder joined together, and
                  resembles the shape of the musical instrument of the same name. But Moschus, in
                  the first book of his treatise on Mechanics, says that the sambuca is originally a
                  Roman engine, and that Heraclides of Pontus was the original inventor of it. But
                  Polybius, in the eighth book of his History, says,—<quote>Marcellus, having been a
                     great deal inconvenienced at that siege of Syracuse by the contrivances of
                     Archimedes, used to say that Archimedes had given his ships drink out of the
                     sea; but that his sambucæ had been buffeted and driven from the entertainment
                     in disgrace.</quote>

               <p>And when, after this, Aemilianus said,—But, my good friend Masurius, I myself,
                  often, being a lover of music, turn my thoughts to the instrument which is called
                  the magadis, and cannot decide whether I am to think that it was a species of
                  flute or some kind of harp. For that sweetest of poets, Anacreon, says somewhere
                  or other— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But Ion of Chios, in his Omphale, speaks of it as if it were a species of
                  flute, in the following words— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And let the Lydian flute, the magadis,</l>

                  </quote> And Aristarchus the grammarian, (a man whom Panætius the Rhodian
                  philosopher used to call the Prophet, because he <pb n="v.3.p.1013"/> could so
                  easily divine the meanings of poem ,) when explaining this verse, affirms that the
                  magadis was a kind of flute: though Aristoxenus does not say so either in his
                  treatise on the Flute-players or in that on Flutes and other Musical Instruments;
                  nor does Archestratus either,—and he also wrote two books on Flute-players; nor
                  has Pyrrhander said so in his work on Flute-players; nor Phillis the Delian, —for
                  he also wrote a treatise on Flute-players and so did Euphranor. But Tryphon, in
                  the second book of his essay on Names, speaks thus—<quote>The flute called
                     magadis.</quote> And in another place he says—"The magadis gives a shrill and
                  deep tone at the same time, as Anaxandrides inti- mates in his Man fighting in
                  heavy Armour, were we find the line— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And Masurius replied—Didymus the gramarian, in his work entitled Interpretations
                  of the Plays of Ion different from the Interpretations of others, says, my good
                  friend Aemilianus, that by the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάγαδις αὐλὸς</foreign>
                  he understands the instrument which is also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιθαριοτήριος;</foreign> which is mentioned by Aristoxenus in the first book
                  of his treatise on the Boring of Flutes; for there he says that there are five
                  kinds of flutes; the parthenius, the pædicus, the citharisterius, the perfect, and
                  the superperfect. And he says that Ion has omitted the conjunction <foreign xml:lang="grc">τε</foreign> improperly, so that we are to understand by <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάγαδις αὐλὸς</foreign> the flute which accompanies the magadis;
                  for the magadis is a stringed (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψαλτικὸν</foreign>)
                  instrument, as Anacreon tells us, and it was invented by the Lydians, on which
                  account Ion, in his Omphale, calls the Lydian women <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψάλτριαι,</foreign> as playing on stringed instruments, in the following

                  </quote> And Euphorion, in his treatise on the Isthmian Games, says, that the
                  magadis is an ancient instrument, but that in latter times it was altered, and had
                  the name also changed to that of the sambuca. And, that this instrument was very
                  much used at Mitylene, so that one of the Muses was represented by an old
                  statuary, whose name was Lesbothemis, as holding one in her hand. But Menæchmus,
                  in his treatise on Artists, says that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πηκτὶς,</foreign>
                  which he calls identical with the magadis, was invented by Sappho. And Aristoxenus
                  says that the magadis and the pectis were both played with the fingers without any
                  plectrum; on which account Pindar, in his Scolium addressed to Hiero, having named
                  the magadis, calls it a responsive harping (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψαλμὸν
                     ἀντίφθογγον</foreign>), because its music is accompanied in all its keys by two
                  kinds of singers, namely, men and boys. And Phrynichus, in his Phœnician Women,
                  has said— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Singing responsive songs on tuneful harps.</l>
                  </quote> And Sophocles, in his Mysians, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>There sounded too the Phrygian triangle,</l>
                     <l>With oft-repeated notes; to which responded</l>
                     <l>The well-struck strings of the soft Lydian pectis.</l>

            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="37">
               <p>But some people raise a question how, as the magadis did not exist in the time of
                  Anacreon (for instruments with many strings were never seen till after his time),
                  Anacreon can possibly mention it, as he does when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I hold my magadis and sing,</l>
                     <l>Striking loud the twentieth string,</l>
                     <l>Leucaspis.</l>
                  </quote> But Posidonius asserts that Anacreon mentions three kinds of melodies,
                  the Phrygian, the Dorian, and the Lydian; for that these were the only melodies
                  with which he was acquainted. And as every one of these is executed on seven
                  strings, he says that it was very nearly correct of Anacreon to speak of twenty
                  strings, as he only omits one for the sake of speaking in round numbers. But
                  Posidonius is ignorant that the magadis is an ancient instrument, though Pindar
                  says plainly enough that Terpander invented the barbitos to correspond to, and
                  answer the pectis in use among the Lydians— <pb n="v.3.p.1015"/>
                  <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The sweet responsive lyre</l>

                  </quote> Now the pectis and the magadis are the same instrument, as Aristoxenus
                  tells us, and Menechmus the Sicyonian too, in his treatise on Artists. And this
                  last author says that Sappho, who is more ancient than Anacreon, was the first
                  person to use the pectis. Now, that Terpander is more ancient than Anacreon, is
                  evident from the following considerations:—Terpander was the first man who ever
                  got the victory at the Carnean<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρνεια</foreign> were a great national festival,
                     celebrated by the Spartans in honour of Apollo Carneius. under which name he
                     was worshipped in several places in Peloponnesus, especially at Amyclæ, even
                     before the re- turn of the Heraclidæ. It was a warlike festival, like the Attic
                     Boedromia. The Carnea were celebrated also at Cyrene, Messene, Sybaris, Sicyon,
                     and other towns.—See Smith's Diet. Ant. <hi rend="italics">in voc.</hi>
                  </note> games, as Hellanicus tells us in the verses in which he has celebrated the
                  victors at the Carnea, and also in the formal catalogue which he gives us of them.
                  But the first establishment of the Carnea took place in the twenty-sixth Olympiad,
                  as Sosibius tells us in his essay on Dates. But Hieronymus, in his treatise on
                  Harp-players, which is the subject of the fifth of his Treatises on Poets, says
                  that Terpander was a contemporary of Lycurgus the law-giver, who, it is agreed by
                  all men, was, with Iphitus of Elis, the author of that establishment of the
                  Olympic games from which the first Olympiad is reckoned. But Euphorion, in his
                  treatise on the Isthmian Games, says that the instruments with many strings are
                  altered only in their names; but that the use of them is very ancient.</p>

                  asserts that the pectis is different from the magadis. And his words are

                     iambics, they called the iambyca, and the instrument to which they sang them in

                     was an instrument uttering a diapason sound, and equally in tune for every
                     portion of the singers. And besides these there were instruments of other kinds
                     also; for there was the barbitos, or barmus, and many others, some with
                     strings, and some with sounding-boards.</quote>

               <p>There were also some instruments besides those which were blown into, and those
                  which were used with different strings, which gave forth only sounds of a simple
                  nature, such as the castanets (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κρέμβαλα</foreign>), which
                  are mentioned by Dicæarchus, in his essay on the Manners and Customs of Greece,

                  order to accompany women while dancing and singing; and when any one touched these
                  instruments with their fingers they uttered a shrill sound. And he says that this

                  lyre, he showed them a little statue of Apollo which they had, which held in its
                  hand a lyre with an equal number of strings, and which was tuned in the same
                  manner; and so he was acquitted. But Douris, in his treatise on Tragedy, says that
                  the magadis was named after Magodis, who was a Thracian by birth. But Apollodorus,
                  in his Reply to the Letter of Aristocles, says—<quote>That which we now call
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψαλτήριον</foreign> is the same instrument which was
                     formerly called magadis; but that which used to be called the clepsiambus, and
                     the triangle, and the elymus, and the nine-string, have fallen into comparative
                     disuse.</quote> And Alcman says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And put away the magadis.</l>
                  </quote> And Sophocles, in his Thamyras, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And well-compacted lyres and magadides,</l>
                     <l>And other highly-polish'd instruments,</l>
                     <l>From which the Greeks do wake the sweetest sounds.</l>
                  </quote> But Telestes, in his dithyrambic poem, called Hymenæus, says that the
                  magadis was an instrument with five strings, using the following expressions—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And each a different strain awakens,—</l>
                     <l>One struck the loud horn-sounding magadis,</l>
                     <l>And in the fivefold number of tight strings</l>
                     <l>Moved his hand to and fro most rapidly.</l>
                  </quote> I am acquainted, too, with another instrument which the Thracian kings
                  use in their banquets, as Nicomedes tells us in his essay on Orpheus. Now Ephorus
                  and Scarmon, in their treatise on Inventions, say that the instrument called the
                     <pb n="v.3.p.1018"/> Phoenix derives its name from having been invented by the
                  Phœnicians. But Semus of Delos, in the first book of the Delias, says that it is
                  so called because its ribs are made of the palm-tree which grows in Delos. The
                  same writer, Semus, says that the first person who used the sambuca was Sibylla,
                  and that the instrument derives its name from having been invented by a man named
                  Sambyx.</p>

               <p>And concerning the instrument called the tripod (this also is a musical
                  instrument) the before-mentioned Artemo writes as follows—<quote>And that is how
                     it is that there are many instruments, as to which it is even uncertain whether
                     they ever existed; as, for instance, the tripod of Pythagoras of Zacynthus. For
                     as it was in fashion but a very short time, and as, either because the
                     fingering of it appeared exceedingly difficult, or for some other reason, it
                     was very soon disused, it has escaped the notice of most writers altogether.
                     But the instrument was in form very like the Delphian tripod, and it derived
                     its name from it; but it was used like a triple harp. For its feet stood on
                     some pedestal which admitted of being easily turned round, just as the legs of
                     movable chairs are made; and along the three intermediate spaces between the
                     feet, strings were stretched; an arm being placed above each, and tuning-pegs,
                     to which the strings were attached, below. And on the top there was the usual
                     ornament of the vase, and of some other ornaments which were attached to it;
                     all which gave it a very elegant appearance; and it emitted a very powerful
                     sound. And Pythagoras divided the three harmonies with reference to three
                     countries,—the Dorian, the Lydian, and Phrygian. And he himself sitting on a
                     chair made on the same principles and after the same pattern, putting out his
                     left hand so as to take hold of the instrument, and using the plectrum in his
                     other hand, moved the pedestal with his foot very easily, so as to use
                     whichever side of the instrument he chose to begin with; and then again turning
                     to the other side he went on playing, and then he changed to the third side.
                     And so rapidly did the easy movement of the pedestal, when touched by the foot,
                     bring the various sides under his hand, and so very rapid was his fingering and
                     execution, that if a person had not seen what was being done, but had judged
                     only by his ear, he would have fancied that he was listening to three
                     harp-players <pb n="v.3.p.1019"/> all playing on different instruments. But
                     this instrument, though it was so greatly admired, after his death rapidly fell

               <p>Now the system of playing the harp without any vocal accompaniment, was, as
                  Menechmus informs us, first introduced by Aristonicus the Argive, who was a
                  contemporary of Archilochus, and lived in Corcyra. But Philochorus, in the third
                  book of his Atthis, says—-" Lysander the Sicyonian harp-player was the first
                  person who ever changed the art of pure instrumental performance, dwelling on the
                  long tones, and producing a very rich sound, and adding also to the harp the music
                  of the flute; and this last addition was first introduced by Epigonus; and taking
                  away the jejuneness which existed in the music of those who played the harp alone
                  without any vocal accompaniment, he first introduced various beautiful

                  And he was the first person who ever attempted to change his instrument while
                  playing. And afterwards, adding dignity to the business, he was the first person
                  to institute a chorus. And Menæchmus says that Dion of Chius was the first person
                  who ever played on the harp an ode such as is used at libations to the honour of
                  Bacchus. But Timomachus, in his History of Cyprus, says that Stesander the Samian
                  added further improvements to his art, and was the first person who at Delphi sang
                  to his lyre the battles narrated in Homer, beginning with the Odyssey. But others
                  say that the first person who ever played amatory strains on his harp was Amiton
                  the Eleuthernæan, who did so in his own city, whose descendants are all called
                  Amitores.</p>
               <p>But Aristoxenus says that just as some men have composed parodies on hexameter
                  verses, for the sake of exciting a <pb n="v.3.p.1020"/> laugh; so, too, others
                  have parodied the verses which were sung to the harp, in which pastime Œnopas led
                  the way. And he was imitated by Polyeuctus the Achæan, and by Diodes of Cynætha.
                  There have also been poets who have composed a low kind of poems, concerning whom
                  Phænias the Eresian speaks in his writings addressed to the Sophists; where he
                  writes thus:—<quote>Telenicus the Byzantian, and also Argas, being both authors of
                     low poems, were men who, as far as that kind of poetry could go, were accounted
                     clever. But they never even attempted to rival the songs of Terpander or
                     Phrynis.</quote> And Alexis mentions Argas, in his Man Disembarked, thus—

                  the custom of the Romans to feast their slaves, while they themselves discharge
                  the offices of their slaves. But this is in reality a Grecian custom. At all
                  events, in Crete, at the festival of Mercury, a similar thing takes place, as
                  Carystius tells us in his Historic Reminiscences; for then, while the slaves are
                  feasting, the masters wait upon them as if they were the servants: and so they do
                  at Trœzen in the month Geræstius. For then there is a festival which lasts for
                  many days, on one of which the slaves play at dice in common with the citizens,
                  and the masters give a banquet to the slaves, as Carystius himself tells us. And
                  Berosus, in the first book of his History of Babylon, says that on the sixteenth
                  day of the month Lous, there is a great festival celebrated in <pb n="v.3.p.1022"/> Babylon, which is called Sakeas; and it lasts five days: and during those days
                  it is the custom for the masters to be under the orders of their slaves; and one
                  of the slaves puts on a robe like the king's, which is called a zoganes, and is
                  master of the house. And Ctesias also mentions this festival in the second book of
                  his History of Persia. But the Coans act in an exactly contrary manner, as
                  Macareus tells us in the third book of his History of Cos. For when they sacrifice
                  to Juno, the slaves do not come to the entertainment; on which account Phylarchus
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     was all falling into the stream of the Peneus; and that all the country which
                     had formerly been covered by the lake was now laid open, and that, as the
                     waters were now drained off, there were plains visible of wondrous size and
                     beauty. Accordingly, Pelasgus, on hearing this statement, had a table loaded
                     with every delicacy set before Pelorus; and every one else received him with
                     great cordiality, and brought whatever they had that was best, and placed it on
                     the table before the man who had brought this news; and Pelasgus himself waited
                     on him with great cheerfulness, and all the rest of the nobles obeyed him as
                     his servants as often as any opportunity offered. On which account, they say
                     that after the Pelasgi occupied the district, they instituted a festival as a
                     sort of imitation of the feast which took place on that occasion; and,
                     sacrificing to Jupiter Pelor, they serve up tables admirably furnished, and
                     hold a very cordial and friendly assembly, so as to receive every foreigner at
                     the banquet, and to set free all the prisoners, and to make their servants sit
                     down and feast with <pb n="v.3.p.1023"/> every sort of liberty and licence,
                     while their masters wait on them. And, in short, even to this day the
                     Thessalians celebrate this as their chief festival, and call it
                     Peloria.</quote>

                     spoken with sufficient correctness. For the eating of sweetmeats (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τραγηματισμὸς</foreign>) is really an eating after supper
                        (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδορπισμὸς</foreign>); and the sweetmeats are

            <div type="chapter" n="51">
               <p>There are many writers who have given lists of the different kinds of cheesecakes,
                  and as far as I can recollect, I will mention them, and what they have said. I
                  know, too, that Callimachus, in his List of Various Books, mentions the treatises
                  on the Art of Making Cheesecakes, written by Aegimius, and Hegesippus, and
                  Metrobius, and also by Phætus. But I will communicate to you the names of
                  cheesecakes which I myself have been able to find to put down, not treating you as
                  Socrates was treated in the matter of the cheesecake which was sent to him by
                  Alcibiades; for Xanthippe took it and trampled upon it, on which Socrates laughed,
                  and said, <quote>At all events you will not have any of it yourself.</quote> (This
                  story is related by Antipater, in the first book of his essay on Passion.) But I,
                  as I am fond of cheesecakes, should have been very sorry to see that divine
                  cheesecake so <pb n="v.3.p.1029"/> injuriously treated. Accordingly, Plato the
                  comic poet ren- tions cheesecakes in his play called The Poet, where he says—
                     <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Am I alone to sacrifice without</l>
                     <l>Having a taste allow'd me of the entrails,</l>
                     <l>Without a cheesecake, without frankincense?</l>
                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do I forget that there is a village, which Demetrius the Scepsian, in the
                  twelfth book of his Trojan Array, tells us bears the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλακοῦς</foreign> (cheesecake); and he says that it is six stadia from
                  Hypoplacian Thebes.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">This was a Thebes in
                     Asia, so called by Homer (Iliad, ii. 397), as being at the foot of a mountain
                     called Placia, or Placos.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now, the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλακοῦς</foreign> ought to have a circumflex
                  in the nominative case; for it is contracted from <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλακόεις,</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυροῦς</foreign> is from <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυρόεις,</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σησαμοῦς</foreign>
                  from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σησαμόεις.</foreign>. And it is used as a substantive,
                  the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρτος</foreign> (bread) being understood.</p>
               <p>Those who have lived in the place assure us that there are capital cheesecakes to
                  be got at Parium on the Hellespont; for it is a blunder of Alexis, when he speaks
                  of them as coming from the island of Paros. And this is what he says in his play
                  called Archilochus:— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>There are also cheesecakes called strepti and neëlata. Both; <pb n="v.3.p.1031"/>
                  these kinds are mentioned by Demosthenes the orator, in his Speech in Defence of
                  Ctesiphon concerning the Crown.</p>
               <p>There are also epichyta. Nicochares, in his Handicraftsmen, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  the same kind of cheesecake as that which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀττανίτης.</foreign> And Hipponax mentions the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀττανίτης</foreign> in the following lines:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Not eating hares or woodcocks,</l>

               </p>
               <p>There is also the creïum. This is a kind of cheesecakes which, at Argos, is
                  brought to the bridegroom from the bride; and it is roasted on the coals, and the
                  friends of the bride- groom are invited to eat it; and it is served up with honey,
                  as Philetas tells us in his Miscellanies.</p>
               <p>There is also the glycinas: this is a cheesecake in fashion among the Cretans,
                  made with sweet wine and oil, as Seleucus tells us in his Dialects.</p>
               <p>There is also the empeptas. The same author speaks of this as a cheesecake made of
                  wheat, hollow and well-shaped, like those which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρηπῖδες;</foreign> being rather a kind of paste into which they put those
                  cheesecakes which are really made with cheese.</p>

                  the same thing, in the third book of his Essay on Alcman; and he says they are in
                  shape like a breast, and that the Lacedæmonians use them at the banquets of women,
                  and that the female friends of the bride, who follow her in a chorus, carry them

               <p>But Chrysippus of Tyana, in his book called the Art of Making Bread, enumerates

                  "you will soften with sour wine, and if you have a little cheese you may mash the
                  montianum up half with wine and half with cheese, and so it will be more
                  palatable. Then there is the clustrum curia- num, the clustrum tuttatum, and the
                  clustrum tabonianum. There are also mustacia made with mead, mustacia made with
                  sesame, crustum purium, gosgloanium, and paulianum.</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>The following cakes resembling cheesecakes,</quote> he says, <quote>are
                     really made with cheese:—the enchytus, the scriblites, the subityllus. There is
                     also another kind of subityllus made of groats. Then there is the spira; this,
                     too, is made with cheese. There are, too, the lucuntli, the argyrotryphema, the
                     libos, the <pb n="v.3.p.1035"/> cercus, the æxaphas, the clustroplacous. There
                     is also,</quote> says Chrysippus, "a cheesecake made of rye. The phthois is
                  made thus:—Take some cheese and pound it, then put it into a brazen sieve and
                  strain it; then put in honey and a hemina<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμίνα</foreign> was equal to a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτύλη,</foreign> and held about half a pint.</note> of flour made from
                  spring wheat, and beat the whole together into one mass.</p>
               <p>"There is another cake, which is called by the Romans catillus ornatus, and which
                  is made thus:—Wash some lettuces and scrape them; then put some wine into a mortar
                  and pound the lettuces in it; then, squeezing out the juice, mix up some flour
                  from spring wheat in it, and allowing it to settle, after a little while pound it
                  again, adding a little pig's fat and pepper; then pound it again, draw it out into
                  a cake, smoothe it, and cut it again, and cut it into shape, and boil it in hot
                  oil, putting all the fragments which you have cut off into a strainer.</p>
               <p>"Other kinds of cheesecakes are the following:—the ostra- cites, the attanites,
                  the amylum, the tyrocoscinnm. Make this last thus:—Pound some cheese (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῦρον</foreign>) carefully, and put it into a vessel; then place
                  above it a brazen sieve (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσκινον</foreign>) and strain the
                  cheese through it. And when you are going to serve it up, then put in above it a
                  sufficient quantity of honey. The cheesecakes called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποτυρίδες</foreign> are made thus:—Put some honey into some milk, pound them,
                  and put them into a vessel, and let them coagulate; then, if you have some little
                  sieves at hand, put what is in the vessel into them, and let. the whey run off;
                  and when it appears to you to have coagulated thoroughly, then take up the vessel
                  in which it is, and transfer it to a silver dish, and the coat, or crust, will be
                  uppermost. But if you have no such sieves; then use some new fans, such as those
                  which are used to blow the fire; for they will serve the same purpose. Then there
                  is the coptoplacous. And also," says he, <quote>in Crete they make a kind of
                     cheesecake which they call gastris. And it is made thus:— Take some Thasian and
                     Pontic nuts and some almonds, and also a poppy. Roast this last with great
                     care, and then take the seed and pound it in a clean mortar; then, adding the
                     fruits which I have mentioned above, beat them up with boiled honey, putting in
                     plenty of pepper, and make the whole into a soft mass, (but it will be of a
                     black colour because of the poppy;) flatten it and make it into a square <pb n="v.3.p.1036"/> shape; then, having pounded some white sesame, soften that
                     too with boiled honey, and draw it out into two cakes, placing one beneath and

                  which the Alexandrians call <foreign xml:lang="grc">παγκαρπία.</foreign> Now this
                  dish consists of a number of cakes mashed up together and boiled with honey. And
                  after they are boiled, they are made up into round balls, and fastened round with
                  a thin string of byblus in order to keep them together. There is also a dish
                  called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλτος,</foreign> which Alcman mentions in the

                  inferior in size to the elm or the fir. And it has great numbers of branches, of
                  great length and rather thorny; but its leaf is tender and green, and of a round
                  shape. And it bears fruit twice a year, in spring and autumn. And the fruit is
                  very sweet, and of the size of a phaulian olive, which it resembles both in its
                  flesh and in its stone; but it is superior in the good flavour of its juice. And
                  the fruit is eaten while still green; and when it has become dry they make it into
                  paste, and eat it without either bruising it or softening it with water, but

                  Ceos, and he expresses himself thus,—<quote>The island produces the very finest
                     pears, equal to that fruit which in Ionia is called hamamelis; for they are
                     free from kernels, and sweet, and delicious.</quote> But Aethlius, in the fifth
                  book of his Samian Annals, if the book be genuine, calls them homomelides. And
                  Pamphilus, in his treatise on Dialects and Names, says, <quote>The epimelis is a
                     species of pear.</quote> Antipho, in his treatise on Agriculture, says that the

                     were disputing with the Bœotians about a district which they called Sidæ,
                     Epaminondas, while engaged in upholding the claims of the Bœotians, suddenly
                     lifted up in his left hand a pomegranate which he had concealed, and showed it
                     to the Athenians, asking them what they called it, and when they said <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥοιὰ,</foreign> But we,' said he, ' call it <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίδη.</foreign>.' And the district bears the pomegranate-tree
                     in great abundance, from which it originally derived its name. And Epaminondas
                     prevailed.</quote> And Menander, in his Heauton-Timorumenos, called them

               <p>The next thing to be mentioned are dates. Xenophon, in the second book of his
                  Anabasis, says—<quote>And there was in the district a great deal of corn, and wine
                     made of the dates, and also vinegar, which was extracted from them; but the
                     berries themselves of the date when like what we see in Greece, were set apart
                     for the slaves. But those which were destined for the masters were all
                     carefully selected, being of a wonderful size and beauty, and their colour was
                     like amber. And some they dry and serve up as sweetmeats; and the wine made
                     from the date is sweet, but it produces headache.</quote> And Herodotus, in his
                  first book, speaking of Babylon says,— <quote>There are palm-trees there growing
                     over the whole plain, most of them being very fruitful; and they make bread,
                     and wine, and honey of them. And they manage the tree in the same way as the
                     fig-tree. For those palm-trees which they call the males they take, and bind
                     their fruit to the other palm-trees which bear dates, in order that the insect
                     which lives in the fruit of the male palm may get into the date and ripen it,
                        <pb n="v.3.p.1042"/> and so prevent the fruit of the date-bearing palm from
                     being spoilt. For the male palm has an insect in each of its fruits, as the
                     wild fig has.</quote> And Polybius of Megalopolis, who speaks with the
                  authority of an eye-witness, gives very nearly the same account of the lotus, as
                  it is called, in Libya, that Herodotus here gives of the palm-tree; for he speaks
                  thus of it: <quote>And the lotus is a tree of no great size, but rough and thorny,
                     and its leaf is green like that of the rhamnus, but a little thicker and
                     broader. And the fruit at first resembles both in colour and size the berries
                     of the white myrtle when full grown; but as it increases in size it becomes of
                     a scarlet colour, and in size about equal to the round olives; and it has an
                     exceedingly small stone. But when it is ripe they gather it. And some they
                     store for the use of the servants, bruising it and mixing it with groats, and
                     packing it into vessels. And that which is preserved for freemen is treated in
                     the same way, only that the stones are taken out, and then they pack that fruit
                     also in jars, and eat it when they please. And it is a food very like the fig,
                     and also like the palm-date, but superior in fragrance. And when it is
                     moistened and pounded with water, a wine is made of it, very sweet and
                     enjoyable to the taste, and like fine mead; and they drink it without water;
                     but it will not keep more than ten days, on which account they only make it in
                     small quantities as they want it. They also make vinegar of the same

                  you this information; that they received this name from Augustus the emperor,
                  because he was exceedingly fond of the fruit, and because Nicolaus of Damascus,
                  who was his friend, was constantly sending him presents of it. And this Nicolaus
                  was a philosopher of the Peripatetic School, and wrote a very voluminous

               <p>Now with respect to dried figs. Those which came from Attica were always
                  considered a great deal the best. Accordingly Dinon, in his History of Persia,
                     says—<quote>And they used to serve up at the royal table all the fruits which
                     the earth produces as far as the king's dominions extend, being brought to him
                     from every district as a sort of first-fruits. And the first king did not think
                     it becoming for the kings either to eat or drink anything which came from any
                     foreign country; and this idea gradually acquired the force of a law. For once,
                     when one of the eunuchs brought the king, among the rest of the dishes at
                     dessert, some Athenian dried figs, the king asked where they came from. And
                     when he heard that they came from Athens, he forbade those who had bought them
                     to buy them for him any more, until it should be in his power to take them
                     whenever he chose, and not to buy them. And it is said that the eunuch did this
                     on purpose, with a view to remind him of the expedition against Attica.</quote>
                  And Alexis, in his Pilot, says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Then came in figs, the emblem of fair Athens,</l>
                     <l>And bunches of sweet thyme.</l>
                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>And Lynceus, in his epistle to the comic poet, Posidippus, says—<quote>In the
                     delineation of the tragic passions, I do not think that Euripides is at all
                     superior to Sophocles, but in dried figs, I do think that Attica is superior to
                     every other country on earth.</quote> And in his letter to Diagoras, he writes
                  thus:—"But this country opposes to the Chelidonian dried figs those which are
                  called Brigindaridæ, which in their name indeed are barbarous, but which in
                  delicious flavour are not at all less Attic than the others. And Phœnicides, in
                  his Hated Woman, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Now these I tasted when I first arrived,</l>

                  </quote> In which lines we must take notice of the mention of the <pb n="v.3.p.1044"/> woodcock. But Philemon, in his treatise on Attic Names, says
                  that <quote>the most excellent dried figs are those called Aegilides; and that
                     Aegila is the name of a borough in Attica, which derives its name from a hero
                     called Aegilus; but that the dried figs of a reddish black colour are called
                     Chelidonians.</quote> Theopompus also, in the Peace, praising the Tithrasian
                  figs, speaks thus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>There's really nothing nicer than dried figs;)</l>
                  </quote> that even Amitrochates, the king of the Indians, wrote to Antiochus,
                  entreating him (it is Hegesander who tells this story) to buy and send him some
                  sweet wine, and some dried figs, and a sophist; and that Antiochus wrote to him in
                  answer, "The dried figs and the sweet wine we will send you; but it is not lawful
                  for a sophist to be sold in Greece. The Greeks were also in the habit of eating
                  dried figs roasted, as Pherecrates proves by what he says in the Corianno, where
                  we find— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     very excellent eating.</quote> Now this is the expression of a most magnificent
                  monarch, who confesses that he himself has never tasted a pheasant, but who used
                  to keep these birds as a sort of treasure. But if he had ever seen such a sight as
                  this, when, in addition to all those which have been already eaten, a pheasant is
                  also placed before each individual, he would have added another book to the

                  And Aristotle or Theophrastus, in his Commentaries, says, <quote>In pheasants, the

            <div type="chapter" n="71">
               <p> But since Menodotus has mentioned the guinea-fowl, we ourselves also will say
                  something on that subject. Clytus the Milesian, a pupil of Aristotle, in the first
                  book of his History of Miletus, writes thus concerning them—<quote>All <pb n="v.3.p.1048"/> around the temple of the Virgin Goddess at Leros, there
                     are birds called guinea-fowls. And the ground where they are bred is marshy.
                     And this bird is very devoid of affection towards its young, and wholly
                     disregards its offspring, so that the priests are forced to take care of them.
                     And it is about the size of a very fine fowl of the common poultry, its head is
                     small in proportion to its body, having but few feathers, but on the top it has
                     a fleshy crest, hard and round, sticking up above the head like a peg, and of a
                     wooden colour. And over the jaws, instead of a beard, they have a long piece of
                     flesh, beginning at the mouth, redder than that of the common poultry; but of
                     that which exists in the common poultry on the top of the beak, which some
                     people call the beard, they are wholly destitute; so that their beak is
                     mutilated in this respect. But its beak is sharper and larger than that of the
                     common fowl; its neck is black, thicker and shorter than that of common
                     poultry. And its whole body is spotted all over, the general colour being
                     black, studded in every part with thick white spots something larger than
                     lentil seeds. And these spots are ring-shaped, in the middle of patches of a
                     darker hue than the rest of the plumage: so that these patches present a
                     variegated kind of appearance, the black part having a sort of white tinge, and
                     the white seeming a good deal darkened. And their wings are all over variegated
                     with white, in serrated,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">There is
                        probably some corruption here.</note> wavy lines, parallel to each other.
                     And their legs are destitute of spurs like those of the common hen. And the
                     females are very like the males, on which account the sex of the guinea-fowls
                     is hard to distinguish.</quote> Now this is the account given of guinea-fowls
                  by the Peripatetic philosopher.</p>

                     increase to their crops by means of moderate warmth and seasonable rains. For
                     they argue that roasting is a kind of cookery which does less good to the meat,
                     while boiling not only removes all its crudities, but has the power also of
                     softening the hard parts, and of making all the rest digestible. And it makes
                     the food more tender and wholesome, on which account they say also, that when

                  For he says that the Samians, when sailing to Sybaris, having touched at the
                  district called Siritis, were so alarmed at the noise made by partridges which

                  of him as there was before all the other guests, but as Hiero afterwards helped
                  him to some, made this extempore verse— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  send him everything necessary for his daily subsistence in great abundance,
                  Simonides used to sell the greater part of what was sent to <pb n="v.3.p.1050"/>
                  him by the king, and reserve only a small portion for his own use. And when some
                  one asked him the reason of his doing so, he said—<quote>In order that both the

                  of Greece, where he is speaking of the temperance of the Lacedæmonians in respect
                  of eating, writing thus—<quote>And the Thasians sent to Agesilais, when he
                     arrived, all sorts of sheep and well-fed oxen; and beside this, every kind of
                     confectionery and sweetmeat. But Agesilaus took the sheep and the oxen, but as
                     for the confectionery and sweetmeats, at first he did not know what they meant,
                     for they were covered up; but when he saw what they were, he ordered the slaves
                     to take them away, saying that it was not the custom of the Lacedæmonians to
                     eat such food as that. But as the Thasians pressed him to take them, he said,
                     Carry them to those men (pointing to the Helots) and give them to them; saying
                     that it was much better for those Helots to injure their health by eating them
                     than for himself and the Lacedæmonians whom he had with him.</quote> And that
                  the Lacedæmonians were in the habit of treating the Helots with great insolence,
                  is related also by Myron of Priene, in the second book of his History of Messene,
                  where he says—<quote>They impose every kind of insulting employment on the Helots,
                     such as brings with it the most extreme dishonour; for they compel them to wear
                     caps of dogskin, and cloaks also of skins; and every year they scourge them
                     without their having committed any offence, in order to present their ever
                     thinking of emancipating themselves from slavery. And besides all this, if any
                     of them ever appear too handsome or distinguished-looking for slaves, they
                     impose death as the penalty, and their masters also are fined for not checking
                     them in their growth and fine appearances. And they give them each a certain
                     piece of land, and fix a portion which they shall invariably bring them in from
                     it.</quote>

                  proclamation, (for the rascal did not show what it was that he had,) he said;—You

                  a cook. And, as no one made any reply to this, he said; Euhemerus the Coan, in the
                  third book of his Sacred History, relates that the Sidonians give this account,
                  that Cadmus was the cook of the king, and that he, having taken Harmonia, who was
                  a female flute-player and also a slave of the king, fled away with her.— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But shall I flee, who am a freeman born</l>
                  </quote> For no one can find any mention in any comedy of a cook being a slave,
                  except in a play of Posidippus. But the introduction of slaves as cooks took place
                  among the Macedonians first, who adopted this custom either out of insolence or on
                  account of the misfortunes of some cities which had been reduced to slavery. And
                  the ancients used to call a cook who <pb n="v.3.p.1054"/> was a native of the
                  country, Mæson; but if he was a foreigner, they called him Tettix. And Chrysippus
                  the philosopher thinks the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαίσων</foreign> is derived
                  from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">μασάομαι,</foreign> to eat; a cook being an
                  ignorant man, and the slave of his appetite; not knowing that Mæson was a comic
                  actor, a Megarian by birth, who invented the mask which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαίσων,</foreign> from him; as Aristophanes of Byzantium tells us,
                  in his treatise on Masks, where he says that he invented a mask for a slave and
                  also one for a cook. So that it is a deserved compliment to him to call the jests
                  which suit those characters <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαισωνικά.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>For cooks are very frequently represented on the stage as jesting characters; as,
                  for instance, in the Men selecting an Arbitrator, of Menander. And Philemon in one
                  of his plays says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Mæson was indeed a Megarian, but from Megara in Sicily, and not from Nisæa. And
                  Posidippus speaks of slaves as cooks, in his Woman Shut out, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  tribe of cooks, who were entitled to public honours; and that it was their

                  no violation of probability in Athenion, in his Samothracians, as Juba says, when

                  treatise on Etymologies), from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">μασάομαι</foreign>
                  (to eat); as also are the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαστίχη</foreign> (mastich)
                  and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάζα</foreign> (barley-cake). But our own opinion is
                  that the word is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάττω,</foreign> and that this
                  is the verb from which <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάζα</foreign> itself is derived, and
                  also the cheese-pudding called by the Cyprians <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαγίς;</foreign> and from this, too, comes the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερμαζάω,</foreign> meaning to be extravagantly luxurious. Originally they
                  used to call this common ordinary food made of barley-meal <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάζα,</foreign> and preparing it they called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάττω.</foreign> And afterwards, varying the necessary food in a luxurious and
                  superfluous manner, they derived a word with a slight change from the form
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάζα,</foreign> and called every very costly kind of dish
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτύη;</foreign> and preparing such dishes they called
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτυάζω,</foreign> whether it were fish, or poultry, or
                  herbs, or beasts or sweetmeats. And this is plain from the testimony of Ale is,
                  quoted by Artemidorus; for Alexis, wishing to show the great luxuriousness of the
                  way in which this dish was prepared, added the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέπομαι.</foreign> And the whole extract runs thus, being <pb n="v.3.p.1060"/> out of a corrected edition of a play which is entitled De- metrius:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Take, then, this meat which thus is sent to you;</l>

                  </quote> But the Athenians use the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέπομαι</foreign>
                  for wanton and unseemly indulgence of the sensual appetites.</p>

               <p>And Artemidorus, in his Dictionary of Cookery, explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτύη</foreign> as a common name for all kinds of costly seasonings; writing
                     thus—<quote>There is also a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτύης</foreign> (he uses
                     the word in the masculine gender) made of birds. Let the bird be killed by
                     thrusting a knife into the head at the mouth; then let it be kept till the next
                     day, like a partridge. And if you choose, you can leave it as it is, the wings
                     on and with its body plucked.</quote> Then, having explained the way in which
                  it is to be seasoned and boiled, he proceeds to say—<quote>Boil a fat hen of the
                     common poultry kind, and some young cocks just beginning to crow, if you wish
                     to make a dish fit to be eaten with your wine. Then taking some vegetables, put
                     them in a dish, and place upon them some of the meat of the fowl, and serve it
                     up. But in summer, instead of vinegar, put some unripe grapes into the sauce,
                     just as they are picked from the vine; and when it is all boiled, then take it
                     out before the stones fall from the grapes, and shred in some vegetables. And
                     this is the most delicious <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτύης</foreign> that there
                     is.</quote>

                  that the same name was also given to a banquet composed of dishes of this sort, we
                  gather from what Philemon says in his Man carried off:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But Alexis, in his Pyraunus, has used the word in an obscure sense:—

               <p>And after this quotation there arose, I think, a discussion about the cottabus and
                  cottabus-players. Now by the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκοτταβίζοντες,</foreign> one of the physicians who were present thought
                  those people were meant, who, after the bath, for the sake of purging their
                  stomach, drink a full draught of wine and then throw it up again; and he said that
                  this was not an ancient custom, and that he was not aware of any ancient author
                  who had alluded to this mode of purging. On which account Erasistratus of Julia,
                  in his treatise on Universal Medicine, reproves those who act in this way,
                  pointing out that it is a practice very injurious to the eyes, and having a very
                  astringent effect on the stomach. And Ulpian addressed him thus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  this is which is the subject of our present discussion, learn from me, in the
                  first place, that the cottabus is a sport of Sicilian invention, the Sicilians
                  having been the original contrivers of it, as Critias the son of Callæschrus tells
                  us in his Elegies, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The cottabus comes from Sicilian lands,</l>

                     <l>Where we put up a target to shoot at with drops</l>
                     <l>From our wine-cup whenever we drink it.</l>
                  </quote> And Dicæarchus the Messenian, the pupil of Aristotle, in his <pb n="v.3.p.1064"/> treatise on Alcæus, says that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λατάγη</foreign> is also a Sicilian noun. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">λατάγη</foreign> means the drops which are left in the bottom after the cup is
                  drained, and which the players used to throw with inverted hand into the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτταβεῖον.</foreign> But Clitarchus, in his treatise on Words,
                  says that the Thessalians and Rhodians both call the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κότταβος</foreign> itself, or splash made by the cups, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λατάγη.</foreign>

                  called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κότταβος,</foreign> as Euripides shows us in his

               <p>For a man must curve his hand excessively before he can throw the cottabus
                  elegantly, as Dicæarchus says; and Plato intimates as much in his Jupiter
                  Ill-treated, where some one calls out to Hercules not to hold his hand too stiff,
                  when he is going to play the cottabus. They also called the very act of throwing
                  the cottabus <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπʼ ἀγκύλης,</foreign> because they curved
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαγκυλόω</foreign>) the right hand in throwing it.
                  Though some say that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύλη,</foreign> in this phrase, means
                  a kind of cup. And Bacchylides, in his Love Poems, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  prize, Antiphanes has shown us in a passage already quoted. And the prize
                  consisted of eggs, sweetmeats, and confectionery. And Cephisodorus, in his
                  Trohonius, <pb n="v.3.p.1066"/> and Callias or Diocles, in the Cyclopes,
                  (whichever of the two is the author,) and Eupolis, and Hermippus, in his Iambics,
                  prove the same thing.</p>
               <p>Now what is called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατακτὸς</foreign> cottabus was
                  something of this kind. There is a high lamp, having on it what is called the
                  Manes, on which the dish, when thrown down, ought to fall; and from thence it
                  falls into the platter which lies below, and which is struck by the cottabus. And
                  there was room for very great dexterity in throwing the cottabus. And Nicochares
                  speaks of the Manes in his Lacedæmonians.</p>

               <p>There is also another way of playing this game with a platter. This platter is
                  filled with water, and in it there are floating some empty saucers, at which the
                  players throw their drops out of their cups, and endeavour to sink them. And he
                  who has succeeded in sinking the greatest number gains the victory. Ameipsias, in
                  his play entitled The Men playing at the Cottabus or Mania, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>There was also another kind of way of playing at the cottabus, in the feasts which
                  lasted all night, which is mentioned by Callippus in his Festival lasting all
                  Night, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> There were also sweetmeats at these nocturnal festivals, in which the men
                  continued awake an extraordinary time dancing. And these sweetmeats used to be
                  called at that time <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαρίσιοι,</foreign> from the joy
                     (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χαρὰ</foreign>) of those who received them. And Eubulus,
                  in his Ancylion, mentions them, speaking as follows— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For he has long been cooking prizes for</l>
                     <l>The victors in the cottabus.</l>
                  </quote> And presently afterwards he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I then sprang out to cook the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαρ́σιος.</foreign>
                     </l>
                  </quote> But that kisses were also given as the prize Eubulus tells us in a
                  subsequent passage— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Come now, ye women, come and dance all night,</l>
                     <l>This is the tenth day since my son was born;</l>
                     <l>And I will give three fillets for the prize,</l>
                     <l>And five fine apples, and nine kisses too.</l>
                  </quote> But that the cottabus was a sport to which the Sicilians were greatly
                  addicted is plain from the fact that they had rooms built adapted to the game;
                  which Dicæarchus, in his treatise on Alcæus, states to have been the case. So that
                  it was not without reason that Callimachus affixed the epithet of Sicilian to
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάταξ.</foreign> And Dionysius, who was surnamed the
                  Brazen, mentions both the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάταγες</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κότταβοι</foreign> in his Elegies, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  servants now bringing us garlands and perfumes. Why now are those who are crowned
                  said to be in love when their crowns are broken? For when I was a boy, and when I
                  used to read the Epigrams of Callimachus, in which this is one of the topics
                  dilated on, I was anxious to understand this point. For the poet of Cyrene says—

                  </quote> You ask, then, why, if the garlands of men who have been crowned are
                  pulled to pieces, they are said to be in love." Is it, since love takes away the
                  strict regularity of manners in the case of lovers, that on this account they
                  think the loss of a conspicuous ornament, a sort of beacon (as Clearchus says, in
                  the first book of his Art of Love) and signal, that they to whom this has happened
                  have lost the strict decorum of their manners? Or do men interpret this
                  circumstance also by divination, as they do many other things? For the ornament of
                  a crown, as there is nothing lasting in it, is a sort of emblem of a passion which
                  does not endure, but assumes a specious appearance for a while: and such a passion
                  is love. For no people are more careful to study appearance than those who are in
                  love. Unless, perhaps, nature, as a sort of god, administering everything with
                  justice and equity, thinks that lovers ought not to be crowned till they have
                  subdued their love; that is to say, till, having prevailed upon the object of
                  their love, they are released from their desire. And accordingly, the loss of
                  their crown we make the token of their being still occupied in the fields of love.
                  Or perhaps Love himself, not permitting any one to be crowned in opposition to, or
                  to be proclaimed as victor over himself, takes their crowns from these men, and
                  gives the perception of this to others, indicating that these men are subdued by
                  him: on which account all the rest say that these men are in love. Or is it
                  because that cannot be loosed which has never been bound, but love is the chain of
                     <pb n="v.3.p.1070"/> some who wear crowns, (for no one else who is bound is
                  more anxious about being crowned than a lover,) that men consider that the loosing
                  of the garland is a sign of love, and therefore say that these men are in love? Or
                  is it because very often lovers, when they have been crowned, often out of
                  agitation as it should seem, allow their crowns to fall to pieces, and so we argue
                  backwards, and attribute this passion to all whom we see in this predicament;
                  thinking that their crown never would have come to pieces, if they had not been in
                  love? Or is it because these loosings happen only in the case of men bound or men
                  in love; and so, men thinking that the loosing of the garland is the loosing also
                  of those who are bound, con- sider that such men are in love? For those in love
                  are bound, unless you would rather say that, because those who are in love are
                  crowned with love, therefore their crown is not of a lasting kind; for it is
                  difficult to put a small and ordinary kind of crown on a large and divine one. Men
                  also crown the doors of the houses of the objects of their love, either with a
                  view to do them honour, as they adorn with crowns the vestibule of some god to do
                  him honour: or perhaps the offering of the crowns is made, not to the beloved
                  objects, but to the god Love. For thinking the beloved object the statue, as it
                  were, of Love, and his house the temple of Love, they, under this idea, adorn with
                  crowns the vestibules of those whom they love. And for the same reason some people
                  even sacri- fice at the doors of those whom they love. Or shall we rather say that
                  people who fancy that they are deprived, or who really have been deprived of the
                  ornament of their soul, consecrate to those who have deprived them of it, the
                  orna- ment also of their body, being bewildered by their passion, and despoiling
                  themselves in order to do so? And every one who is in love does this when the
                  object of his love is present, but when he is not present, then he makes this
                  offering in the public roads. On which account Lycophronides has re- presented
                  that goatherd in love, as saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Moreover, that most divine writer Plato, in the seventh book of his Laws, proposes
                  a problem having reference to crowns, which it is worth while to solve; and these
                  are the words of the philosopher:—<quote>Let there be distributions of apples and
                     crowns to a greater and a lesser number of people, in such a way that the
                     numbers shall always be equal.</quote> These are the words of Plato. But what
                  he means is something of this sort. He wishes to find one number of such a nature
                  that, if divided among all who come in to the very last, it shall give an equal
                  number of apples or crowns to every one. I say, then, that the number sixty will
                  fulfil these conditions of equality in the case of six fellow-feasters; for I am
                  aware that at the beginning we said that a supper party ought not to consist of
                  more than five. But we are as numerous as the sand of the sea. Accordingly the
                  number sixty, when the party is completed to the number of six guests, will begin
                  to be divided in this manner. The first man came into the banqueting room, and
                  received sixty garlands. He gives to the second who comes in half of them; and
                  then each of them have thirty. Then when a third comes in they divide the whole
                  sixty, so that each of them may have twenty. Again, they divide them again in like
                  manner at the entrance of a fourth guest, so that each has fifteen; and when a
                  fifth comes in they all have twelve a-piece. And when the sixth guest arrives,
                  they divide them again, and each individual has ten. And in this way the equal
                  division of the garlands is accomplished.</p>

                  </quote> And why also does the same poet represent some people as crowned with
                  osiers? for in the second book of his Odes, he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But as he made no reply, and pretended to be considering the matter, Democritus
                  said:—Aristarchus the gram- marian, my friend, when interpreting this passage,
                  said that the ancients used to wear crowns of willow. But Tenarus says that the
                  willow or osier is the rustics' crown. And other interpreters have said many
                  irrelevant things on the subject. But I, having met with a book of Menodotus of
                  Samos, which is entitled, A Record of the things worth noting at Samos, found
                  there what I was looking for; for he says that "Admete, the wife of Eurystheus,
                  after she had fled from Argos, came to Samos, and there, when a vision of Juno had
                  appeared to her, she wishing to give the goddess a reward because she had arrived
                  in Samos from her own home in safety, undertook the care of the temple, which
                  exists even to this day, and which had been originally built by the Leleges and
                  the Nymphs. But the Argives hearing <pb n="v.3.p.1073"/> of this, and being
                  indignant at it, persuaded the Tyrrhenians by a promise of money, to employ
                  piratical force and to carry off the statue,—the Argives believing that if this
                  were done Admete would be treated with every possible severity by the inhabitants
                  of Samos. Accordingly the Tyrrhenians came to the port of Juno, and having
                  disembarked, immediately applied themselves to the performance of their
                  undertaking. And as the temple was at that time without any doors, they quickly
                  carried off the statue, and bore it down to the seaside, and put it on board their
                  vessel. And when they had loosed their cables and weighed anchor, they rowed as
                  fast as they could, but were unable to make any progress. And then, thinking that
                  this was owing to divine interposition, they took the statue out of the ship again
                  and put it on the shore; and having made some sacrificial cakes, and offered them
                  to it, they departed in great fear. But when, the first thing in the morning,
                  Admete gave notice that the statue had disappeared, and a search was made for it,
                  those who were seeking it found it on the shore. And they, like Carian barbarians,
                  as they were, thinking that the statue had run away of its own accord, bound it to
                  a fence made of osiers, and took all the longest branches on each side and twined
                  them round the body of the statue, so as to envelop it all round. But Admete
                  released the statue from these bonds, and purified it, and placed it again on its
                  pedestal, as it had stood before. And on this account once every year, since that
                  time, the statue is carried down to the shore and hidden, and cakes are offered to
                  it: and the festival is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τονεὺς,</foreign> because it
                  happened that the statue was bound tightly (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συντόνως</foreign>) by those who made the first search for it.</p>

               <p>"But they relate that about that time the Carians, being overwhelmed with
                  superstitious fears, came to the oracle of the god at Hybla, and consulted him
                  with reference "O these occurrences; and that Apollo told them that they must give

                  captivity. And as he was inclined to give a satisfaction which should not cause
                  him severe pain, this was what the god <pb n="v.3.p.1074"/> imposed upon him. And
                  from this circumstance the use of this kind of crown which had been shown to
                  Prometheus got common among the rest of mankind who had been benefited by him by
                  his gift of fire: on which account the god enjoined the Carians also to adopt a
                  similar custom,—to use osiers as a garland, and bind their heads with the branches
                  with which they themselves had bound the goddess. And he ordered them also to
                  abandon the use of every other kind of garland except that made of the bay-tree:
                  and that tree he said he gave as a gift to those alone who are employed in the

                  given them by the oracle, and if in their banquets they paid the goddess the
                  satisfaction to which she was entitled, they should be protected from injury: on
                  which account the Carians, wishing to obey the commands laid on them by the
                  oracle, abolished the use of those garlands which they had previously been
                  accustomed to wear, but permitted all those who were employed in the service of

                  and a man who in numberless passages shows his fondness for mentioning points
                  connected with the history of his country. And these are his words:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>I am not oft, O Philotherus, fond</l>
                     <l>Of feasting in the city, but prefer</l>
                     <l>The country, where the open breeze of zephyr</l>
                     <l>Freshens my heart; a simple bed</l>
                     <l>Beneath my body is enough for me,</l>
                     <l>Made of the branches of the native willow (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόμαλος</foreign>),</l>
                     <l>And osier (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λύγος</foreign>), ancient garland of the
                        Carians,—</l>

                     <l>The great protecting queen of this our isle.</l>
                  </quote> But in the selines Nicænetus speaks ambiguously, for it is not quite
                  plain whether he means that the osier is to make his bed or his garland; though
                  afterwards, when he calls it the ancient garland of the Carians, he alludes
                  clearly enough to what we are now discussing. And this use of osiers to <pb n="v.3.p.1075"/> make into garlands, lasted in that island down to the time of
                  Polycrates, as we may conjecture. At all events Anacreon says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And the Gods know that I first found all this out in the beautiful city of
                  Alexandria, having got possession of the treatise of Menodotus, in which I showed
                  to many people the passage in Anacreon which is the subject of discussion. But
                  Hephæstion, who is always charging every one else with thefts, took this solution
                  of mine, and claimed it as his own, and published an essay, to which he gave this
                  title, <quote>Concerning the Osier Garland mentioned by Anacreon.</quote> And a
                  copy of this essay we lately found at Rome in the possession of the antiquary
                  Demetrius. And this compiler Hephæstion behaved in the same way to our excellent
                  friend Adrantus. For after he had published a treatise in five books, Concerning
                  those Matters in Theophrastus in his books on Manners, which are open to any
                  Dispute, either as to their Facts, or the Style in which they are mentioned; and
                  had added a sixth book Concerning the Disputable Points in the Nicomachean Ethics
                  of Aristotle; and in these books had entered into a long dissertation on the
                  mention of Plexippus by Antipho the tragic poet, and had also said a good deal
                  about Antipho himself; Hephæstion, I say, appropriated all these books to himself,
                  and wrote another book, Concerning the Mention of Antipho in the Memorabilia of
                  Xenophon, not having added a single discovery or original observation of his own,
                  any more than he had in the discussion on the Osier Garland. For the only thing he
                  said that was new, was that Phylarchus, in the seventh book of his Histories,
                  mentioned this story about the osier, and knew nothing of the passage of
                  Nicænetus, nor of that of Anacreon; and he showed that he differed in some
                  respects from the account that had been given by Menodotus.</p>
               <p>But one may explain this fact of the osier garlands more simply, by saying that
                  Megisthes wore a garland of osier because there was a great quantity of those
                  trees in the place where he was feasting; and therefore he used it to bind his <pb n="v.3.p.1076"/> temples. For the Lacedæmonians at the festival of the
                  Promachia, wear garlands of reeds, as Sosibius tells us in his treatise on the
                  Sacrificial Festivals at Lacedæmon, where he writes thus: <quote>On this festival
                     the natives of the country all wear garlands of reeds, or tiaras, but the boys
                     who have been brought up in the public school follow without any garland at
                     all.</quote>

               <p>But Aristotle, in the second book of his treatise on Love Affairs, and Ariston the
                  Peripatetic, who was a native of Ceos, in the second book of his Amatory
                  Resemblances, say that <quote>The ancients, on account of the headaches which were
                     produced by their wine-drinking, adopted the practice of wearing garlands made
                     of anything which came to hand, as the binding the head tight appeared to be of
                     service to them. But men in later times added also some ornaments to their
                     temples, which had a kind of reference to their employment of drinking, and so
                     they invented garlands in the present fashion. But it is more reasonable to
                     suppose that it was because the head is the seat of all sensation that men wore
                     crowns upon it, than that they did so because it was desirable to have their
                     temples shaded and bound as a remedy against the headaches produced by
                     wine.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>They also wore garlands over their foreheads, as the sweet Anacreon says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> They also wore garlands on their breasts, and anointed them with perfume,
                  because that is the seat of the heart. And they call the garlands which they put
                  round their necks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποθυμιάδες,</foreign> as Alcæus does in

                  </quote> But Sappho gives a more simple reason for our wearing garlands, speaking

                     <l>But place those garlands on thy lovely hair,</l>

                     <l>Who come before them with uncrowned heads.</l>
                  </quote> In which lines she enjoins all who offer sacrifice to wear garlands on
                  their heads, as they are beautiful things, and acceptable to the Gods. Aristotle
                  also, in his Banquet, says, <quote>We never offer any mutilated gift to the Gods,
                     but only such as are perfect and entire; and what is full is entire, and
                     crowning anything indicates filling it in some sort. So Homer says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Now Philonides the physician, in his treatise on Ointments and Garlands, says,
                  "After the vine was introduced into Greece from the Red Sea, and when most people
                  had become addicted to intemperate enjoyment, and had learnt to drink unmixed
                  wine, some of them became quite frantic and out of their minds, while others got
                  so stupified as to resemble the dead. And once, when some men were drinking on the
                  sea-shore, a violent shower came on, and broke up the party, and filled the
                  goblet, which had a little wine left in it, with water. But when it became fine
                  again, the men returned to the same spot, and tasting the new mixture, found that
                  their enjoyment was now not only exquisite, but free from any subsequent pain. And
                  on this account, the Greeks <pb n="v.3.p.1078"/> invoke the good Deity at the cup
                  of unmixed wine, which is served round to them at dinner, paying honour to the
                  Deity who invented wine; and that was Bacchus. But when the first cup of mixed
                  wine is handed round after dinner, they then invoke Jupiter the Saviour, thinking
                  him the cause of this mixture of wine which is so unattended with pain, as being
                  the author of rain. Now, those who suffered in their heads after drinking,
                  certainly stood in need of some remedy; and so the binding their heads was what
                  most readily occurred to them, as Nature herself led them to this remedy. For a
                  certain man having a headache, as Andreas says, pressed his head, and found
                  relief, and so invented a ligature as a remedy for headache.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, men using these ligatures as assistants in drinking, used to bind
                  their heads with whatever came in their way. And first of all, they took garlands
                  of ivy, which offered itself, as it were, of its own accord, and was very
                  plentiful, and grew everywhere, and was pleasant to look upon, shading the
                  forehead with its green leaves and bunches of berries, and bearing a good deal of
                  tension, so as to admit of being bound tight across the brow, and imparting also a
                  certain degree of coolness without any stupifying smell accompanying it. And it
                  seems to me that this is the reason why men have agreed to consider the garland of
                  ivy sacred to Bacchus, implying by this that the inventor of wine is also the
                  defender of men from all the inconveniences which arise from the use of it. And
                  from thence, regarding chiefly pleasure, and considering utility and the comfort
                  of the relief from the effects of drunkenness of less importance, they were
                  influenced chiefly by what was agreeable to the sight or to the smell. And
                  therefore they adopted crowns of myrtle, which has exciting properties, and which
                  also represses any rising of the fumes of wine; and garlands of roses, which to a
                  certain extent relieve headache, and also impart some degree of coolness; and
                  garlands also of bay leaves, which they think are not wholly unconnected with
                  drinking parties. But garlands of white lilies, which have an effect on, the head,
                  and wreaths of amaracus, or of any other flower or herb which has any tendency to
                  produce heaviness or torpid feelings in the head, must be avoided." And
                  Apollodorus, in his treatise on Perfumes and Garlands, <pb n="v.3.p.1079"/> has
                  said the same thing in the very same words. And this, my friends, is enough to say
                  on this subject.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="18">
               <p>But concerning the Naucratite Crown, and what kind of flowers that is made of, I
                  made many investigations, and inquired a great deal without learning anything,
                  till at last I fell in with a book of Polycharmus of Naucratis, entitled On Venus,
                  in which I found the following passage: —<quote>But in the twenty-third Olympiad
                     Herostratus, a fellow-countryman of mine, who was a merchant, and as such had
                     sailed to a great many different countries, coming by chance to Paphos, in
                     Cyprus, bought an image of Venus, a span high, of very ancient workmanship, and
                     came away meaning to bring it to Naucratis. And as he was sailing near the,
                     Egyptian coast, a violent storm suddenly overtook him, and the sailors could
                     not tell where they were, and so they all had recourse to this image of Venus,
                     entreating her to save them. And the goddess, for she was kindly disposed
                     towards the men of Naucratis, on a sudden filled all the space near her with
                     branches of green myrtle, and diffused a most delicious odor over the whole
                     ship, when all the sailors had previously despaired of safety from their
                     violent sea-sickness. And after they had been all very sick, the sun shone out,
                     and they, Seeing the landmarks, came in safety into Naucratis. And Herostratus
                     having disembarked from the ship with his image, and carrying with him also the
                     green branches of myrtle which had so suddenly appeared to him, consecrated it
                     and them in the temple of Venus. And having sacrificed to the gooddess, and
                     having consecrated the image to Venus, and invited all his relations and most
                     intimate friends to a banquet in the temple, he gave every one of them a
                     garland of these branches of myrtle, to which garlands he then gave the name of
                     Naucratite.</quote> This is the account given by Polcharmus; and I myself
                  believe the statement, and believe that the Naucratite garland is no other than
                  one made of myrtle, especially as in Anacreon it is represented as worn with one
                  made of roses. And Philonides has said that the garland made of myrtle acts as a
                  check upon the fumes of wine, and that the one made of roses, in addition to its
                  cooling qualities, is to a certain extent a remedy for headache. And, therefore,
                  those men are only to be laughed at, who say that the Naucratite garland is the
                  wreath made of what is called by the <pb n="v.3.p.1080"/> Egyptians biblus,
                  quoting the statement of Theopompus, in the third book of his History of Greece,
                  where he says, <quote>That when Agesilaus the Lacedæmonian arrived in Egypt, the
                     Egyptians sent him many presents, and among them the papyrus, which is used for
                     making garlands.</quote> But I do not know what pleasure or advantage there
                  could be in having a crown made of biblus with roses, unless people who are
                  enamoured of such a wreath as this should also take a fancy to wear crowns of
                  garlic and roses together. But I know that a great many people say that the
                  garland made of the sampsychon or amaracus is the Naucratite garland; and this
                  plant is very plentiful in Egypt, but the myrtle in Egypt is superior in sweetness
                  to that which is found in any other country, as Theophrastus relates in another
                  place.</p>

                  </quote> And the same poet says, in his play entitled Bacchus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  besides what you find there. For you cannot show me that any one has ever spoken
                  separately of a garland of roses, and a garland of violets. For as for the

               <p>And he, laughing, replied,—The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέφανος</foreign> was
                  first used among the Greeks, as Semos the Delian tells us in the fourth book of
                  his Delias, in the same sense as the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέφανος</foreign>
                  is used by us, which, however, by some people is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέμμα.</foreign> On which account, being first crowned with this <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέφανος,</foreign> afterwards we put on a garland of bay leaves;
                  and the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέφανος</foreign> itself is derived from the
                  verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέφω,</foreign> to crown. But do you, you loquacious
                  Thessalian, think, says he, that I am going to repeat any of those old and
                  hacknied stories? But <pb n="v.3.p.1081"/> because of your tongue (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γλῶσσα</foreign>), I will mention the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπογλωττὶς,</foreign> which Plato speaks of in his Jupiter Ill-treated— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But since I have mentioned Alexandria, I know that in that beautiful city there is
                  a garland called the garland of Antinous, which is made of the lotus, which grows
                  in those parts. And this lotus grows in the marshes in the summer season; and it
                  bears flowers of two colours; one like that of the rose, and it is the garlands
                  woven of the flower of this colour which are properly called the garlands of
                  Antinous; but the other kind is called the lotus garland, being of a dark colour.
                  And a man of the name of Pancrates, a native poet, with whom we ourselves were
                  acquainted, made a great parade of showing a rose-coloured lotus to Adrian the
                  emperor, when he was staying at Alexandria, saying, that <pb n="v.3.p.1082"/> he
                  ought to give this flower the name of the Flower of Antinous, as having sprung
                  from the ground where it drank in the blood of the Mauritanian lion, which Hadrian
                  killed when he was out hunting in that part of Africa, near Alexandria; a
                  monstrous beast which had ravaged all Libya for a long time, so as to make a very
                  great part of the district desolate. Accordingly, Hadrian being delighted with the
                  utility of the invention, and also with its novelty, granted to the poet that he
                  should be maintained for the future in the Museum at the public expense; and
                  Cratinus the comic poet, in his Ulysseses, has called the lotus <foreign xml:lang="grc">στεφάνωμα,</foreign> because all plants which are full of leaf,
                  are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">στεφανώματα</foreign> by the Athenians. But
                  Pancrates said, with a good deal of neatness, in his poem— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  twenty cubits in circumference, and that it is carried in procession on the

                  of Egypt, writes as follows—<quote>There is a city on the banks of the river,
                     named Tindium. This is place where many gods are assembled, and in the middle
                     of the city there is a sacred temple of great size made of marble, and the
                     doors are marble. And within the temple there are <pb n="v.3.p.1086"/> white
                     and black thorns, on which garlands were placed made of the flower of the
                     acanthus, and also of the blossoms of the pomegranate, and of vine leaves. And
                     these keep green for ever. These garlands were placed by the gods themselves in
                     Egypt when they heard that Babys was king, (and he is the same who is also
                     called Typhon.)</quote> But Demetrius, in his History of the Things to be seen
                  in Egypt, says that these thorns grow about the city of Abydos, and he writes
                  thus— <quote>But the lower district has a tree called the thorn, which bears a
                     round fruit on some round-shaped branches. And this tree blooms at a certain
                     season; and the flower is very beautiful and brilliant in colour. And there is
                     a story told by the Egyptians, that the Aethiopians who had been sent as allies
                     to Troy by Tithonus, when they heard that Memnon was slain, threw down on the
                     spot all their garlands on the thorns. And the branches themselves on which the
                     flower grows resemble garlands.</quote> And the before-mentioned Hellanicus
                  mentions also that Amasis, who was king of Egypt, was originally a private
                  individual of the class of the common people; and that it was owing to the present
                  of a garland, which he made of the most beautiful flowers that were in season, and
                  sent to Patarmis, who was king of Egypt, at the time when he was celebrating the
                  festival of his birthday, that he afterwards became king himself. For Patarmis,
                  being delighted at the beauty of the garland, invited Amasis to supper, and after
                  this treated him as one of his friends; and on one occasion sent him out as his
                  general, when the Egyptians were making war upon him. And he was made king by
                  these Egyptians out of their hatred to Patarmis.</p>

               <p>Now Theophrastus gives the following list of flowers as suitable to be made into
                     garlands—-<quote>The violet, the flower of Jupiter, the iphyum, the wallflower,
                     the hemerocalles, or yellow lily. But he says the earliest blooming flower is
                     the white violet; and about the same time that which is called the wild
                     wallflower appears, and after them the narcissus and the lily; and of mountain
                     flowers, that kind of anemone which is called the mountain anemone, and the
                     head of the bulb-plant. For some people twine these flowers into garlands. And
                     next to these there comes the œnanthe and the purple violet. And of wild
                     flowers, there are the helichryse, and that species of anemone called the
                     meadow anemone, and the gladiolus, and the hyacinth. But the rose is the latest
                     blooming flower of all; and it is the latest to appeal and the first to go off.
                     But the chief summer flowers are the lychnis, and the flower of Jupiter, and
                     the lily, and the iphyum, and the Phrygian amaracus, and also the flower called
                     the pothus.</quote> And in his ninth book the same Theophrastus says, if any
                  one wears a garland made of the flower of the helichryse, he is praised if he
                  sprinkle it with ointment. And, Alcman mentions it in these lines— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And I pray to you, and bring</l>
                     <l>This chaplet of the helichryse,</l>
                     <l>And of the holy cypirus.</l>

                     <l>And helichryse, and apple blossoms,</l>
                     <l>And roses, and the tender daphne.</l>
                  </quote> And Cratinus, in his Effeminate People, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> But the helichryse is a flower like the lotus. And Themistagoras the
                  Ephesian, in his book entitled The Golden Book, says that the flower derives its
                  name from the nymph who <pb n="v.3.p.1088"/> first picked it, who was called
                  Helichrysa. There are also, says Theophrastus, such flowers as purple lilies. But

                  Corinthians also call this flower ambrosia, as Nicander says in his Dictionary.

                     and the purple violet is of the same appearance, but it is far more
                     fragrant.</quote> And Apollodorus, in his treatise on Beasts, says—<quote>There
                     is the chamæpitys, or ground pine, which some call olocyrum, but the Athenians
                     call it Ionia, and the Eubœans sideritis.</quote> And Nicander, in the second

                  thoroughly discuss all the flowers fit for making into garlands,) says—<quote>The
                     violet (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴον</foreign>) was originally given by some

               </p>
               <p>And in the sixth book of his History of Plants, Theophrastus says that the
                  narcissus is also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείριον;</foreign> but in a
                  subsequent passage he speaks of the narcissus and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείριον</foreign> as different plants. And Eumachus the Corcyrean, in his
                  treatise on Cutting Roots, says that the narcissus is also called acacallis, and
                  likewise crotalum. But the flower called hemerocalles, or day-beauty, which fades
                  at night but blooms <pb n="v.3.p.1089"/> at sunrise, is mentioned by Cratinus in
                  his Effeminate People, where he says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> Concerning the ground thyme, Theophrastus says—<quote>The people gather
                     the wild ground thyme on the mountains and plant it around Sicyon, and the
                     Athenians gather it on Hymettus; and other nations too have mountains fill of

                  is called zygis. And Amerias the Macedonian, speaking of the lychnis in his
                  treatise on Cutting up Roots, says that <quote>it sprang from the baths of Venus,
                     when Venus bathed after having been sleeping with Vulcan. And it is found in
                     the greatest perfection in Cyprus and Lemnos, and also in Stromboli and near
                     mount Eryx, and at Cythera.</quote>

               <p>
                  <quote>But the iris,</quote> says Theophrastus, <quote>blooms in the summer, and
                     is the only one of all the European flowers which has a sweet scent. And it is
                     in the highest beauty in those parts of Illyricum which are at a distance from
                     the sea.</quote> But Philinus says that the flowers of the iris are called
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύκοι,</foreign> because they resemble the lips of the
                  wolf (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λύκος</foreign>). And Nicolaus of Damascus, in the
                  hundred and eighth book of his History, says that there is a lake near the Alps,
                  many stadia in circumference, round which there grow every year the most fragrant
                  and beautiful flowers, like those which are called calchæ. Alcman also mentions
                  the calchæ in these lines:— <quote rend="blockquote">

            <div type="chapter" n="29">
               <p>Of roses, says Theophrastus in his sixth book, there are many varieties. For most
                  of them consist only of five leaves, but some have twelve leaves; and some, near
                  Philippi, have even as many as a hundred leaves. For men take up the plants from
                  Mount Pangæum, (and they are very numerous there,) and plant them near the city.
                  And the inner petals are very small; for the fashion in which the flowers put out
                  their petals is, that some form the outer rows and some the inner ones: but they
                  have not much smell, nor are they of any great size. And those with only five
                  leaves are the most fragrant, and their lower parts are very thorny. But the most
                  fragrant roses are in Cyrene: on which account the <pb n="v.3.p.1090"/> perfumes
                  made there are the sweetest. And in this country, too, the perfume of the violets,
                  and of all other flowers, is most pure and heavenly; and above all, the fragrance
                  of the crocus is most delicious in those parts." And Timachidas, in his Banquets,
                  says that the Arcadians call the rose <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐόμφαλον,</foreign>
                  meaning <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔοσμον,</foreign> or fragrant. And Apollodorus, in
                  the fourth book of his History of Parthia, speaks of a flower called philadelphum,
                  as growing in the country of the Parthians, and describes it thus:—<quote>And
                     there are many kinds of myrtle, —the milax, and that which is called the
                     philadelphum, which has received a name corresponding to its natural character;
                     for when branches, which are at a distance from one another, meet together of
                     their own accord, they cohere with a vigorous embrace, and become united as if
                     they came from one root, and then growing on, they produce fresh shoots: on
                     which account they often make hedges of them in well-cultivated farms; for they
                     take the thinnest of the shoots, and plait them in a net-like manner, and plant
                     them all round their gardens, and then these plants, when plaited together all
                     round, make a fence which it is difficult to pass through.</quote>

               <p>From these lines it is plain that the chelidonium is a different flower from the
                  anemone (for some people have called them the same). But Theophrastus says that
                  there are some plants, the flowers of which constantly follow the stars, such as
                  the one called the heliotrope, and the chelidonium; and this last plant is named
                  so from its coming into bloom at the same time as the swallows arrive. There is
                  also a flower spoken of under the name of ambrosia by Carystius, in his Historical
                  Commentaries, where he says—<quote>Nicander says that the plant named ambrosia
                     grows at Cos, on the head of the statue of Alexander.</quote> But I have

                  theseum,— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Pherecrates also, or whoever the poet was who wrote the play of the Persians,
                  mentions some flowers as fit for garlands, and says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>And while the slaves were bringing round perfumes in alabaster boxes, and in other
                  vessels made of gold, some one, seeing Cynulcus, anointed his face with a great
                  deal of ointment. But he, being awakened by it, when he recollected himself,
                  said;—What is this? O Hercules, will not some one come with a sponge and wipe my
                  face, which is thus polluted with a lot of dirt? And do not you all know that that
                  exquisite writer Xenophon, in his Banquet, represents Socrates as speaking
                     thus:—<quote>' By Jupiter! O Callias, you entertain us superbly; for you have
                     not only given us a most faultless feast, but you have furnished us also with
                     delicious food for our eyes and ears.'—' Well, then,' said he, 'suppose any one
                     were to bring us perfumes, in order that we might also banquet on sweet smells?
                     '—' By no means,' said Socrates; ' for as there is one sort of dress fit for
                     women and another for men, so there is one kind of smell fit for women and
                     another for men. And no man is ever anointed with perfume for the sake of men;
                     and as to women, especially when they are brides,—as, for instance, the bride
                     of this Niceratus here, and the bride of Critobulus,—how can they want perfumes
                     in their husbands, when they themselves are redolent of it But the smell of the
                     oil in the gymnasia, when it is present, is sweeter than perfume to women; and
                     when it is absent, they long more for it. For if a slave and a freeman be
                     anointed with perfume, they both smell alike in a moment; but those smells
                     which are derived from free labours, require both virtuous habits and a good
                     deal of time if they are to be agreeable and in character with a
                     freeman.'</quote> And <pb n="v.3.p.1097"/> that admirable writer Chrysippus
                  says that perfumes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μύρα</foreign>) derive their name from
                  being prepared with great toil (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μόρος</foreign>) and useless
                  labour. The Lacedæmonians even expel from Sparta those who make perfumes, as being
                  wasters of oil; and those who dye wool, as being destroyers of the whiteness of
                  the wool. And Solon the philosopher, in his laws, forbade men to be sellers of
                  perfumes.</p>

                     effeminate who have anything to do with them. And do you think that effeminacy
                     without virtue has anything desirable in it? But even Sappho, a thorough woman,
                     and a poetess into the bargain, was ashamed to separate honour from elegance;
                     and speaks thus— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     confessed had respectability and honour in it; and these things especially
                     belong to virtue. But Parrhasius the painter, although he was a man beyond all
                     measure arrogant about his art, and though he got the credit of a liberal
                     profession by some mere pencils and pallets, still in words set up a claim to
                     virtue, and put this inscription on all his works that are at Lindus:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     a disgrace to the delicacy and beauty of virtue, having perverted the gifts
                     which fortune had bestowed upon him to luxury, proposed to change the

                     he, the man must be endured, since he says that he honours virtue.</quote>
                  These are the words of Clearchus. But Sophocles the poet, in his play called The
                  Judgment, represents Venus, being a sort of Goddess of Pleasure, as anointed with
                  perfumes, and looking in a glass; but Minerva, as being a sort of Goddess of
                  Intellect and Mind, and also of Virtue, as using oil and gymnastic exercises.</p>

                  the heart, and considering it an admitted point that that is soothed with fragrant
                  smells. And the ancients used to act thus, not only because scents do of their own
                  nature ascend upwards from the breast to the seat of smelling, but also because
                  they thought that the soul had its abode in the heart; as Praxagoras, and

                  are prepared with the greatest skill in Egypt. But the Metopian is made of oil
                  which is extracted from bitter almonds. Still, the superior excellence of each
                  perfume is owing to the purveyors and the materials and the artists, and not to
                  the place itself; for Ephesus formerly, as men say, had a high reputation for the
                  excellence of its perfumes, and especially of its megallium, but now it has none.
                  At one time, too, the unguents made in Alexandria were brought to high perfection,
                  on account of the wealth of the city, and the attention that Arsinoe and Berenice
                  paid to such matters; and the finest extract of roses in the world was made at
                  Cyrene while the great Berenice was alive. Again, in ancient times, the extract of
                  vine-leaves made at Adramyttium was but poor; but afterwards it became first-rate,
                  owing to Stratonice, the wife of Eumenes. Formerly, too, Syria used to make every
                  sort of unguent admirably, especially that extracted from fenugreek; but the case
                  is quite altered now. And long ago there used to be a most delicious unguent
                  extracted from frankincense at Pergamus, owing to the invention of a certain
                  perfumer of that city, for no one else had ever made it before him; but now none
                  is made there.</p>

                  <quote>Now, when a valuable unguent is poured on the top of one that is inferior,
                     it remains on the surface; but when good honey is poured on the top of that
                     which is inferior, it works its way to the bottom, for it compels that which is
                     worse to rise above it.</quote>

                  <pb n="v.3.p.1101"/> And Hicesius says, in the second book of his treatise on

                     the perfume made from roses is suitable for drinking parties, and so is that
                     made from myrtles and from apples; and this last is good for the stomach, and
                     useful for lethargic people. That made from vine-leaves is good for the
                     stomach, and has also the effect of keeping the mind clear. Those extracted
                     from sampsychum and ground thyme are also well suited to drinking parties; and
                     so is that extract of crocus which is not mixed with any great quantity of
                     myrrh. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">στακτὴ,</foreign>, also, is well suited for
                     drinking parties; and so is the spikenard: that made from fenugreek is sweet
                     and tender; while that which comes from white violets is fragrant, and very
                     good for the digestion.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>Theophrastus, also, in his treatise on Scents, says, <quote>that some perfumes are
                     made of flowers; as, for instance, from roses, and white violets, and lilies,
                     which last is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σούσινον.</foreign> There are also
                     those which are extracted from mint and ground thyme, and gopper, and the
                     crocus; of which the best is procured in Aegina and Cilicia. Some, again, are
                     made of leaves, as those made from myrrh and the œnanthe; and the wild vine
                     grows in Cyprus, on the mountains, and is very plentiful; but no perfume is
                     made of that which is found in Greece, because that has no scent. Some
                     perfumes, again, are extracted from roots; as is that made from the iris, and
                     from spikenard, and from marjoram, and from zedoary.</quote>

                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδυπαθὴς</foreign> (luxurious). Sophocles also uses the
                  word <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάκκαρις;</foreign> and Magnes, in his Lydians, says—

                     <l>The stacte at two minæ's not worth having.</l>
                  </quote> Now the citizens of Sardis were not the only people addicted to the use
                  of unguents, as Alexis says in his Maker of Goblets— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The whole Sardian people is of unguents fond;</l>
                  </quote> but the Athenians also, who have always been the leaders of every
                  refinement and luxury in human life, used them very <pb n="v.3.p.1105"/> much; so
                  that among them, as has been already mentioned, they used to fetch an enormous
                  price; but, nevertheless, they did not abstain from the use of them on that
                  account; just as we now do not deny ourselves scents which are so expensive and
                  exquisite that those things are mere trifles which are spoken of in the Settler of
                  Alexis— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>For he did use no alabaster box</l>

               <p>Just think, in God's name, my friends, what luxury, or I should rather say, what
                  profuse waste it was to have one's garments sprinkled in this manner, when a man
                  might have taken up a little unguent in his hands, as we do now, and in that
                  manner have anointed his whole body, and especially his head. For Myronides says,
                  in his treatise on Unguents and Garlands, that <quote>the fashion of anointing the
                     head at banquets arose from this:—that those men whose heads are naturally dry,
                     find the humours which are engendered by what they eat, rise up into their
                     heads; and on this account, as their bodies are inflamed by fevers, they bedew
                     their heads with lotions, so as to prevent the neighbouring humours from rising
                     into a part which is dry, and which also has a considerable vacuum in it. And
                     so at their banquets, having consideration for this fact, and being afraid of
                     the strength of the wine rising into their heads, men have introduced the
                     fashion of anointing their heads, and by these means the wine, they think, will
                     have less effect upon then, if they make their head thoroughly wet first. And
                     as men are never content with what is merely useful, but are always desirous to
                     add to that whatever tends to pleasure and enjoyment; in that way they have
                     been led to adopt the use of unguents.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>We ought, therefore, my good cynic Theodorus, to use at banquets those unguents
                  which have the least tendency to produce heaviness, and to employ those which have
                  astringent <pb n="v.3.p.1106"/> or cooling properties very sparingly. But
                  Aristotle, that man of most varied learning, raises the question, <quote>Why men
                     who use unguents are more grey than others? Is it because unguents have drying
                     properties by reason of the spices used in their composition, so that they who
                     use them become dry, and the dryness produces greyness? For whether greyness
                     arises from a drying of the hair, or from a want of natural heat, at all events
                     dryness has a withering effect. And it is on this account too that the use of
                     hats makes men grey more quickly; for by them the moisture which ought to
                     nourish the hair is taken away.</quote>

               <p>But when I was reading the twenty-eighth book of the History of Posidonius, I
                  observed, my friends, a very pleasant thing which was said about unguents, and
                  which is not at all foreign to our present discussion. For the philosopher says
                     —<quote>In Syria, at the royal banquets, when the garlands are given to the
                     guests, some slaves come in, having little bladders full of Babylonian
                     perfumes, and going round the room at a little distance from the guests, they
                     bedew their garlands with the perfumes, sprinkling nothing else.</quote> And
                  since the discussion has brought us to this point, I will add <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>A verse to Love,</l>
                  </quote> as the bard of Cythera says, telling you that Janus, who is worshipped as
                  a great god by us, and whom we call Janus Pater, was the original inventor of
                  garlands. And Dracon of Corcyra tells us this in his treatise on Precious Stones,
                  where his words are—<quote>But it is said that Janus had two faces, the one
                     looking forwards and the other backwards; and that it is from him that the
                     mountain Janus and the river Janus are both named, because he used to live on
                     the mountain. And they say that he was the first inventor of garlands, and
                     boats, and ships; and was also the first person who coined brazen money. And on
                     this account many cities in Greece, and many in Italy and Sicily, place on
                     their coins a head with two faces, and on the obverse a boat, or a garland, or
                     a ship. And they say that he married his sister Camise, and had a son named
                     Aethax, and a daughter Olistene. And he, aiming at a more extended power and
                     renown, sailed over to Italy, and settled on a mountain near Rome, which was
                     called Janiculum from his name.</quote>

               <p>This, now, is what was said about perfumes and unguents. And after this most of

                  Deity, others that of Health, and different people invoking different deities; and
                  so they all fell to quoting the words of those poets who had mentioned libations
                  to these different deities; and I will now recapitulate what they said, for they

               <p>And Theophrastus, in his essay on Drunkenness, says— <quote>The unmixed wine which
                     is given at a banquet, which they call the pledge-cup in honour of the Good
                     Deity, they offer in small quantities, as if reminding the guests of its
                     strength, <pb n="v.3.p.1108"/> and of the liberality of the god, by the mere
                     taste. And they hand it round when men are already full, in order that there
                     may be as little as possible drunk out of it. And having paid adoration three
                     times, they take it from the table, as if they were entreating of the gods that
                     nothing may be done unbecomingly, and that they may not indulge in immoderate
                     desires for this kind of drink, and that they may derive only what is
                     honourable and useful from it.</quote> And Philochorus, in the second book of
                  his Atthis, says—<quote>And a law was made at that time, that after the solid food
                     is removed, a taste of the unmixed wine should be served round as a sort of
                     sample of the power of the Good Deity, but that all the rest of the wine should
                     be previously mixed; on which account the Nymphs had the name given them of
                     Nurses of Bacchus.</quote> And that when the pledge-cup to the Good Deity was
                  handed round, it was customary to remove the tables, is made plain by the wicked
                  action of Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily. For there was a table of gold placed
                  before the statue of Aesculapius at Syracuse; and so Dionysius, standing before
                  it, and drinking a pledge-cup to the Good Deity, ordered the table to be
                  removed.</p>
               <p>But among the Greeks, those who sacrifice to the Sun, as Phylarchus tells us in
                  the twelfth book of his History, make their libations of honey, as they never
                  bring wine to the altars of the gods; saying that it is proper that the god who
                  keeps the whole universe in order, and regulates everything, and is always going
                  round and superintending the whole, should in no respect be connected with

               <p>Most writers have mentioned the Attic Scolia; and they are worthy also of being

                  for that description of poetry, Alcæus and Anacreon; as Aristophanes says in his

                  </quote> Praxilla, the Sicyonian poetess, was also celebrated for the composition
                  of scolia. Now they are called scolia, not because of the character of the verse
                  in which they are written, as if it were <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκολιὸς</foreign>
                  (crooked); for men call also <pb n="v.3.p.1109"/> those poems written in a laxer

                     three kinds of songs</quote> (as Artemo of Cassandra says in the second book of
                  his treatise on the Use of Books), <quote>one or other of which comprehends
                     everything which is sung at banquets; the first kind is that which it was usual
                     for the whole party to sing; the second is that which the whole party indeed
                     sang, not, however, together, but going round according to some kind of
                     succession; the third is that which is ranked lowest of all, which was not sung
                     by all the guests, but only by those who seemed to understand what was to be
                     done, wherever they might happen to be sitting; on which account, as having
                     some irregularity in it beyond what the other kinds had, in not being sung by
                     all the guests, either together or in any definite kind of succession, but just
                     as it might happen, it was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκολιόν.</foreign> And
                     songs of this kind were sung when the ordinary songs, and those in which every
                     one was bound to join, had come to an end. For then they invited all the more
                     intelligent of the guests to sing some song worth listening to. And what they
                     thought worth listening to were such songs as contained some exhortations and
                     sentiments which seemed useful for the purposes of life.</quote>

                     the minister of Eubulus, whom he succeeded. He entertained Aristotle at his
                     court for many years. As he endeavoured to maintain his kingdom in independence
                     of Persia, they sent Mentor against him, who decoyed him to an interview by a
                     promise of safe conduct, and then seized him and sent him to Artaxerxes, by

                  Demophilus, who instituted a prosecution against the philosopher, on the ground of

                  Eurymedon, who was ashamed to appear himself in the business). And he rested the
                  charge of impiety on the fact of his having been accustomed to sing at banquets a
                  pæan addressed to Hermias. But that this song has no characteristic whatever of a

                  Duris, in his book entitled The Annals of the Samians, says is sung in Samos. That

                  Alexinus the logician was the author, as Hermippus the pupil of Callimachus says
                  in the first book of his Essay on Aritotle. And this song is sung at Delphi, with
                  a boy playing the lyre as an accompaniment <pb n="v.3.p.1114"/> to it. The song,
                  too, addressed to Agemon of Corinth, the father of Alcyone, which the Corinthians
                  sang, contains the burden of the paean. And this burden, too, is even added by
                  Polemo Periegetes to his letter addressed to Aranthius. The song also which the
                  Rhodians sing, addressed to Ptolemy the first king of Egypt, is a paean: for it
                  contains the burden Io Paean, as Georgus tells us in his essay on the Sacrifices
                  at Rhodes. And Philochorus says that the Athenians sing paeans in honour of
                  Antigonus and Demetrius, which were composed by Hermippus of Cyzicus, on an
                  occasion when a great many poets had a contest as to which could compose the
                  finest paean, and the victory was adjudged to Hermippus. And, indeed, Aristotle
                  himself, in his Defence of himself from this accusation of impiety, (unless the
                  speech is a spurious one,) says—<quote>For if I had wished to offer sacrifice to
                     Hermias as an immortal being, I should never have built him a tomb as a mortal;
                     nor if I had wished to make him out to be a god, should I have honoured him
                     with funeral obsequies like a man.</quote>

                  who succeeded Philetærus as king of Pergamus, judge of all his subjects in the <pb n="v.3.p.1115"/> Aeolian district." And the same writer, in the nineteenth
                  book of the same work, says that Seleucus the composer of merry songs was the son
                  of Mnesiptolemus, who was an historian, and who had great interest with that
                  Antiochus who was surnamed the Great. And it was very much the fashion to sing

               <p>And Cynulcus said;—There have been many poets who have applied themselves to the
                  composition of parodies, my good friend; of whom the most celebrated was Eubœus of
                  Paros, who lived in the time of Philip; and he is the man who attacked the
                  Athenians a great deal. And four books of his Parodies are preserved. And Timon
                  also mentions him, in <pb n="v.3.p.1116"/> the first book of his Silli. But
                  Polemo, in the twelfth book of his Argument against Timæus, speaking of the men
                  who have written parodies, writes thus—"And I should call Bœotus and Eubœus, who
                  wrote parodies, men of great reputation, on account of their cleverness in
                  sportive composition, and I consider that they surpass those ancient poets whose
                  followers they were. Now, the invention of this kind of poetry we must attribute
                  to Hipponax the Iambic poet. For he writes thus, in his Hexameters,— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Muse, sing me now the praises of Eurymedon,</l>
                     <l>That great Charybdis of the sea, who holds</l>
                     <l>A sword within his stomach, never weary</l>

                     <l>On the loud-sounding shore of the barren sea.</l>
                  </quote> Epicharmus of Syracuse also uses the same kind of poetry, in a small
                  degree, in some of his plays; and so does Cratinus, a poet of the old Comedy, in
                  his Eunidæ, and so also does his contemporary, Hegemon of Thasos, whom they used
                  to call Lentil. For he writes thus— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And when I Thasos reach'd they took up filth,</l>

                     <l>My lovely money among the Thasians:</l>
                     <l>Lest any of the Grecian dames at home</l>
                     <l>Should be enraged when they behold my wife</l>
                     <l>Making Greek bread, a poor and scanty meal.</l>
                     <l>Or if they see a cheesecake small, should say,—</l>

                     <l>And in my mind revolving all these things,</l>
                     <l>Pallas Minerva at my side appeared,</l>

But some one else used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυχνεὼς,</foreign> and a third called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοφνίας,</foreign> saying hat that was the proper name for a torch made of
                  bark; another called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανός;</foreign> and another

                  insisting on it that that was the proper name for a lamp, being derived frome
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕλη,</foreign>, brightness; <pb n="v.3.p.1118"/> and
                  urging that Neanthes used this word in the first book of his History of Attalus.
                  Others, again, of the party made use of whatever other words they fancied; so that
                  there was no ordinary noise; while all were vying with one another in adducing
                  every sort of argument which bore upon the question. For one man said that
                  Silenus, the dictionary-maker, mentioned that the Athenians call lamps <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανοί.</foreign> But Tima- chidas of Rhodes asserts that for
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανός,</foreign> the word more properly used is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέλετρον,</foreign> being a sort of lantern which young men use
                  when out at night, and which they themselves call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕλαναι.</foreign> But Amerias for <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανὸς</foreign> uses
                  the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">γράβιον.</foreign> And this word is thus explained
                  by Seleucus:—<quote>
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">γράβιον</foreign> is a stick of ilex or common oak,
                     which, being pounded and split, is set on fire, and used to give light to
                     travellers. Accordingly Theodoridas of Syracuse, in his Centaurs, which is a
                     dithyrambic poem, says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Then, when many of the guests cried out Io Pæan, Pontianus said;—I wish, my
                  friends, to learn from you whether Io Pæan is a proverb, or the burden of a song,
                  or what else it is. And Democritus replied;—–Clearchus the Solensian, inferior to
                  none of the pupils of the wise Aristotle, in the first book of his treatise on
                  Proverbs, says that <quote>Latona, when she was taking Apollo and Diana from
                     Chalcis in Eubœa to Delphi, came to the cave which was called the cave of the
                     Python. And when the Python attacked them, Latona, holding one of her children
                     in her arms, got upon the stone which even now lies at the foot of the brazen
                     statue of Latona, which is dedicated as a representation of what then took
                     place near the Plane-tree at Delphi, and cried out <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞ἵε,
                        παῖ;</foreign> (and Apollo happened to have his bow in hand;) and this is
                     the same as if she had said <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎ἄφιε, ῞ιε, παῖ,</foreign> or
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάλε, παῖ,</foreign> Shoot, boy. And from this day

                        παιὼν</foreign> arose. But some people, slightly altering the word, use it

                     an expression that is familiar to us it is forgotten that it is a proverb, and

                  called to the god, saying "that each of these metres belongs to the god; <pb n="v.3.p.1122"/> because when the first two syllables are made long, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵη παιὰν,</foreign> it becomes a heroic verse, but when they are
                  pronounced short it is an iambic, and thus it is plain that we must attribute the
                  iambic to him. And as the rest are short, if any one makes the last two syllables
                  of the verse long, that makes a Hipponactean iambic.</p>
