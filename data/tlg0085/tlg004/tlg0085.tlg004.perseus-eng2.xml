            <sp>
               <speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<l n="1">Men of Cadmus’s city, he who guards from the stern the concerns of the State and guides its helm with eyes untouched by sleep must speak to the point.  For if we succeed, the responsibility is heaven’s;</l>
<l n="5">but if—may it not happen—disaster is our lot, Eteocles would be the one name shouted many times throughout the city in the citizens’ resounding uproars and laments.  From these evils may Zeus the Defender, upholding his name, shield the city of the Cadmeans!</l>
               <milestone unit="para"/><l n="10">But now you—both he who is still short of his youthful prime, and he who, though past his prime, still strengthens the abundant growth of his body, and every man still in his prime, as is fitting—you must aid the State and</l>
<l n="15">the altars of your homeland’s gods so that their honors may never be obliterated.  You must aid, too, your children, and Mother Earth, your beloved nurse.  For welcoming all the distress of your childhood, when you were young and crept upon her kind soil, she raised you to inhabit her and bear the shield,</l>
<l n="20">and to prove yourselves faithful in this time of need.  And so, until today, God has been favorably inclined, for though we have long been under siege, the war has gone well for the most part through the gods’ will.  But now, as the seer, the herdsman of birds, informs us,</l>
<l n="25">using his ears and his mind to understand with unerring skill the prophetic birds unaided by sacrificial fire—he, master of such prophecy, declares that the greatest <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> attack is being planned in night assembly and that they will make plans to capture our city.</l>
<l n="30">Hurry each of you to the battlements and the gates of our towered walls! Rush with all your armor! Fill the parapets and take your positions on the platforms of the towers.  Stand your ground bravely where the gates open out,</l>
<l n="35">and do not be afraid of this crowd of foreigners. God will bring it to a good end.
   <milestone unit="para"/>I myself have dispatched scouts and men to observe their army, and I am confident that their going is not in vain.  Once I have heard their report, I will not be taken by any trickery.

<l n="39">Eteocles, mighty prince of the Cadmeans,</l>
<l n="40">I have returned with a sure report of the army outside the walls; I myself am an eyewitness of their actions.  Seven warriors, fierce regiment-commanders, slaughtered a bull over a black shield, and then touching the bull’s gore with their hands they swore an oath</l>
<l n="45">by Ares, by Enyo,<note anchored="true" n="45" resp="Smyth">Enyo is a personification of war, and hence sometimes called the mother or the daughter of Ares.</note> and by Rout who delights in blood, that either they will level the city and sack the Cadmeans’ town by force, or will in death smear this soil with their blood.  And on Adrastus’ chariot they were placing remembrances of themselves</l>
<l n="50">for their parents at home, and were shedding tears while so doing, but no piteous wailing escaped their lips.  For their iron- hearted spirit heaved, blazing with courage, as of lions with war in their eyes.  Your knowledge of these things was not delayed by fearfulness;</l>
<l n="55">for I left them casting lots to decide how each commander, his post assigned by chance, would lead his regiment against the gates.  Therefore, choose the bravest men of the city and station them quickly at the outlets of the gates.  For nearby already the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army in full armor 
</l>
<l n="60">is advancing in a flurry of dust, and glistening foam splatters the plain in drops from the horses’ pantings.  So you, like the careful helmsman of a ship, secure the city before Ares’ blasts storm down upon it; for the wave of their army now crashes over the dry land.</l>
<l n="65">Seize the first opportune moment for doing this.  For all else, I, on my part, will keep a reliable eye on the lookout, and you, by learning from my certain report what happens beyond the gates, shall remain unharmed.  <stage rend="italic">Exit.</stage>

Tydeus is already storming opposite the Proetid gates; but the seer will not allow him to ford the Ismenus because the omens from the sacrifices are not favorable.</l>
<l n="380">Yet Tydeus, raging and eager for battle, shouts like a serpent hissing at high noon, and lashes skilled Oecles’ son, with the taunt that he cringes in cowardice before death and battle.  With such cries he shakes three overshadowing plumes,</l>
<l n="385">his helmet’s mane, while from under his shield, bells forged of bronze therein ring out a fearsome clang.  He has this haughty symbol on his shield: a well-crafted sky, ablaze with stars, and the brightness of the full moon shining in the center of the shield,</l>
<l n="390">the moon that is the most revered of the stars, the eye of night.  Raving so in his arrogant armor, he shouts beside the river-bank, craving battle, like some charger that fiercely champs at the bit as he waits in eagerness for the trumpet’s war-cry.</l>

<l n="405">would prove rightly and justly named; and it is against himself that he will have prophesied this outrageous violence.  Now as for me, against Tydeus I will station the trusty son of Astacus as defender of this gate, since he is full noble and</l>
<l n="410">reveres the throne of Honor and detests proud speech.  He is slow to act disgracefully, and he has no cowardly nature.

<l n="570">Stationed at the Homoloid gate, he repeatedly rebukes mighty Tydeus with evil names <q type="spoken">Murderer, maker of unrest in the city, principal teacher of evils to the Argives, summoner of vengeance’s Curse, servant of Slaughter, counselor to Adrastus in these evil plans.</q> And next, with eyes looking upward, he addressed your own brother, mighty Polynices who shares your blood, and called him by name, dwelling twice upon its latter part.<note anchored="true" n="579" resp="Smyth">Polynices <gloss>much-strife</gloss> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολύ νεῖκος</foreign>). <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνδατούμενος</foreign>, literally <gloss>separating,</gloss> i.e. dwelling with emphasis on each separate part of the name.</note> These were his words:</l>
<l n="580"><q type="spoken">Will such a deed as this be pleasing to the gods, fine to hear of and to relate to those in the future—that you sacked the city of your ancestors and your native gods and launched a foreign army against them?

   <foreign xml:lang="grc">μητρὸς πηγή</foreign> strictly means <gloss>source, which consists in a mother.</gloss> Having used this expression for <q type="emph">mother, who is the source of life,</q> the poet accommodates the verb to the literal sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πηγή</foreign> rather than use a verb of slaying which would have suited the personal object.</note></q>

<l n="590">So the seer spoke as untroubled he held his all-bronze shield.  No symbol was fixed to his shield’s circle.  For he does not wish to appear the bravest, but to be the bravest, as he harvests the fruit of his mind’s deep furrow, where his careful resolutions grow.</l>

<l n="620">Just the same, I will station a man against him, mighty Lasthenes, a gate-keeper who hates foreigners.  He has the wisdom of an old man, but his body is at its prime: his eyes are quick, and he does not let his hand delay for his spear to seize what is left exposed by the shield.</l>

<l n="660">whether the babbling letters shaped in gold on his shield, together with his mind’s wanderings, will bring him back.

<l n="670">Indeed, Justice would truly be false to her name, if she should ally herself with a man so utterly audacious in his plans.  Trusting in this fact I will go and stand against him—I myself in person.  Who else has a more just claim? Commander against commander, brother against brother,</l>

<l n="1011">It is my duty to announce the will and decrees of the council on behalf of the people of this our Cadmean city.
   <milestone unit="para"/>It is decreed, first, that Eteocles here, on account of his goodwill towards the city, is to be buried in a kindly grave in its soil;</l>
<l n="1015">for hating the enemy he chose death in the city and driven by piety towards his ancestral shrines, he died without reproach where it is an honor for the young to die.  This is how I was commanded to speak regarding him.  But as for his brother, it is decreed that this corpse of Polyneices</l>
<l n="1020">is to be cast out of the city unburied to be torn by dogs, since he would have been the destroyer of the land of the Cadmeans, if one of the gods had not used his brother’s spear to prevent him.  Even in death he will retain the stain of his guilt against his fathers’ gods, whom he dishonored</l>
<l n="1025">when he launched a foreign army against the city to take it.  For this reason it is decreed that he will receive his reward by being buried without honor beneath the winged birds; and that no labor of the hands shall attend him by building up a burial mound nor shall anyone offer him reverence in shrill-sung laments.  </l>
<l n="1030">He is to be refused the honor of being carried in funeral procession by his loved ones.  Such is the decree of the Cadmean authorities.

<l n="1032">I at least will say something to the rulers of the Cadmeans: even if no one else is willing to share in burying him, I will bury him alone and risk the peril</l>
<l n="1035">of burying my own brother.  Nor am I ashamed to act in defiant opposition to the rulers of the city.  A thing to be held in awe is the common womb from which we were born, of a wretched mother and unfortunate father.  Therefore, my soul, willingly share his evils, even though they are unwilling,</l>
<l n="1040">and live in kindred spirit with the dead.  No hollow-bellied wolves will tear his flesh—let no one <q type="emph">decree</q> that! Even though I am a woman, I will myself find the means to give him burial and a grave,</l>
<l n="1045">carrying the earth in the fold of my linen robe.  With my own hands I will cover him over—let no one <q type="emph">decree</q> it otherwise.  Take heart, I will have the means to do it.
