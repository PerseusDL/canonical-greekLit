<l n="40">This is now the tenth year since Priam’s mighty adversary, king Menelaus, and with him king Agamemnon, the mighty pair of Atreus’ sons, joined in honor of throne and sceptre by Zeus,</l>
<l n="45">set forth from this land with an army of a thousand ships manned by Argives, a warrior force to champion their cause. 
   <milestone unit="para"/>Loud rang the battle-cry they uttered in their rage, just as eagles scream which,</l>
<l n="50">in lonely grief for their brood, rowing with the oars of their wings, wheel high over their bed, because they have lost the toil of guarding their nurslings’ nest.

<l n="60">Even so Zeus, whose power is over all, Zeus, lord of host and guest, sends against Alexander the sons of Atreus, that for the sake of a woman with many husbands<note anchored="true" n="62" resp="Smyth">Menelaus, Paris, Deiphobus.</note>he may inflict many and wearying struggles (when the knee is pressed in the dust and</l>
<l n="65">the spear is splintered in the onset) on Danaans and on Trojans alike.
   <milestone unit="para"/>The case now stands where it stands—it moves to fulfilment at its destined end.  Not by offerings burned in secret, not by secret libations,</l>

   <milestone unit="para"/>But we, incapable of service by reason of our aged frame, discarded from that martial mustering of long ago, wait here at home,</l>
<l n="75">supporting on our canes a strength like a child’s.  For just as the vigor of youth, leaping up within the breast, is like that of old age, since the war-god is not in his place; so extreme age, its leaves</l>

<l n="90">the gods of the heavens and of the marketplace, have their altars ablaze with offerings.  Now here, now there, the flames rise high as heaven, yielding</l>

<l n="100">This now at one moment bodes ill, while then again hope, shining with kindly light from the sacrifices, wards off the biting care of the sorrow that gnaws my heart.

<l n="505">Many hopes have shattered, one only have I seen fulfilled; for I never dared to dream that here in this land of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> I should die and have due portion of burial most dear to me.  Now blessings on the land, blessings on the light of the sun, and blessed be Zeus, the land’s Most High, and the Pythian lord;</l>
<l n="510">and may he launch no more his shafts against us.  Enough of your hostility did you display by Scamander’s banks; but now, in other mood, be our preserver and our healer, O lord Apollo. And the gods gathered here, I greet them all; him, too, my own patron,</l>
               <l n="515">Hermes, beloved herald, of heralds all revered; and the heroes<note anchored="true" n="516" resp="Smyth">The heroes are the deified spirits of the ancient kings and other illustrious men. In <bibl n="Aesch. Supp. 25">Aesch.  Supp. 25</bibl> they are included under the nether powers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χθόνιοι</foreign>).</note>who sped us forth, I pray that they may receive back in kindliness the remnant of the host which has escaped the spear.
               Hail, halls of our kings, beloved roofs, and you august seats, and you divinities that face the sun<note anchored="true" n="519" resp="Smyth">Statues of the gods, in front of the palace, placed to front the east.</note>,</l>
<l n="520">if ever you did in days gone by, now after long lapse of years, with gladness in your eyes receive your king.  For bearing light in darkness to you and to all assembled here alike, he has returned—Agamemnon, our king.  Oh greet him well, as is right,</l>
<l n="525">since he has uprooted <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with the mattock of Zeus the Avenger, with which her soil has been uptorn.  Demolished are the altars and the shrines of her gods; and the seed of her whole land has been wasted utterly.  Upon the neck of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> he has cast such a yoke.</l>
<l n="530">Now he has come home, our king, Atreus’ elder son, a man of happy fate, worthy of honor beyond all living men.  For neither Paris nor his partner city can boast that the deed was greater than the suffering.  Convicted for robbery and for theft as well,</l>
<l n="535">he has lost the plunder and has razed in utter destruction his father’s house and even the land.  The sons of Priam have paid a twofold penalty for their sins.
