As for the lands in which they dwelt, to one had been assigned by lot the land of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, to the other that of the barbarians.  The two, as I imagined it, seemed to provoke each other to a mutual feud, and my son,  when he had become aware of this,</l>
<l n="190">attempted to restrain and placate them. He yoked them both to his car and placed the collar-straps upon their necks.  The one bore herself proudly in these trappings and kept her mouth obedient to the rein.  The other struggled and with her hands</l>
<l n="195">tore apart the harness of the car; then, free of the curb,  she dragged it violently along with her and snapped the yoke in two.  My son was hurled to the ground and his father Darius stood by his side filled with pity.  But Xerxes, when he caught sight of him, tore the garments covering his body.

If, however, it is something inauspicious that you have seen, visit the gods with supplication and entreat them to avert the evil and to bring to pass what will be beneficial to you, your children, the kingdom, and all else that you hold dear.  Next, it is appropriate that you should</l>

<l n="353">My Queen, some destructive power or evil spirit, appearing from somewhere or other, caused the beginning of our utter rout.</l>
<l n="355">A Hellene, from the Athenian host, came to your son Xerxes and told this tale: that, when the gloom of black night should set in, the Hellenes would not remain in place, but, springing upon the rowing benches of their ships, would seek, some here, some there,</l>
<l n="360">to preserve their lives by stealthy flight.  But Xerxes, when he heard this, comprehending neither the cleverness of the Greek nor that the gods grudged him success, straightway gave all his captains orders to this effect—that, when the sun had ceased to illumine the earth with his beams,</l>
<l n="365">and darkness had covered the region of the sky, they should bring up in a tight group the main body of the fleet, disposed in triple line, to bar the exits and the sounding straits, and station other ships in a circle around the island of Ajax. He gave them a warning too that, should the Hellenes escape an evil doom,</l>
<l n="370">finding by stealth some means of flight for their fleet, it had been decreed that every captain should lose his head.  These commands he made with complete confidence of heart, since he knew not the issue intended by the gods.  Our crews then, with no lack of order but with an obedient spirit,</l>
<l n="375">prepared their evening meal, while each sailor looped his oar about its thole-pin so that it fitted well.  But when the light of the sun had faded and night drew on, each master of an oar and each man versed in arms went on board.</l>
<l n="380">The long galleys cheered each other, line by line; and they held their course as each captain had been ordered, and all through the night the commanders of the fleet kept their whole force cruising to and fro across the strait.  Night began to wane,</l>
<l n="385">yet the fleet of the Hellenes in no way attempted to put forth by stealth.  When, however, radiant Day with her white horses shone over all the land, a loud cheer like a song of triumph first rang out from the Hellenes, and, at the same instant,</l>
<l n="390">clear from the island crags, an echo returned an answering cry.  Terror fell on all the barbarians, balked of their purpose; for then the Hellenes chanted their solemn paean, not as in flight, but as men rushing to the onset with the courage of gallant hearts.

<l n="395">The trumpet with its blast set all their side afire, and instantly, at the word of command, with the even stroke of foaming oars they struck the briny deep.  Swiftly they all came clear into view.  Their right wing, well marshalled,</l>
<l n="400">led on in orderly advance, next their whole army pressed on against us, and at the same time a loud shout met our ears: <q type="spoken">On, you men of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>!  Free your native land. Free your children, your wives, the temples of your fathers’ gods,and the tombs of your ancestors.  Now you are fighting for all you have.</q>  Then from our side arose in response the mingled clamor of Persian speech, and straightaway the ships dashed together their bronze prows.  It was a ship of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>
                  </l>
<l n="410">that began the charge and chopped off in its entirety the curved stern of a Phoenician boat. Each captain drove his ship straight against some other ship.  At first the stream of the Persian army held its own. When, however, the mass of our ships had been crowded in the narrows, and none could render another aid,</l>
<l n="415">and each crashed its bronze prow against each of its own line, they splintered their whole bank of oars. Then the Hellenic galleys, not heedless of their chance, hemmed them in and battered them on every side.  The hulls of our vessels rolled over, and the sea was hidden from our sight,</l>
<l n="420">strewn as it was with wrecks and slaughtered men.  The shores and reefs were crowded with our dead, and every ship that formed a part of the barbarian fleet plied its oars in disorderly flight.  But, as if our men were tuna or some haul of fish,</l>
<l n="425">the foe kept striking and hacking them with broken oars and fragments of wrecked ships. Groans and shrieks together filled the open sea until the face of black night hid the scene.  But as for the the full extent of our disasters, this, even if I had ten days in succession to do so, I could not describe to you.</l>
<l n="430">However,  you can be sure that so great a multitude of men never perished in a single day.

<l n="450">There Xerxes dispatched these, his choicest troops, in order that when the Hellenic enemy, wrecked from their ships, should flee in search of safety to the island, they might slaughter their force, an easy prey, and rescue their comrades from the straits of the sea.  Grievously did he misjudge the issue.  For when some god</l>
<l n="455">had given the glory to the Hellenes in the battle on the sea, on that same day, fencing their bodies in armor of bronze, they leapt from their ships and encircled the whole island, so that our men were at a loss which way to turn.  Often they were struck by stones slung from their hands,</l>
<l n="460">and arrows sped from the bow-string kept falling upon them and doing them harm.  At last the Hellenes, charging with one shout, struck them and hacked to pieces the limbs of the poor wretches, until they had utterly quenched the life of all.</l>
<l n="465">Xerxes groaned aloud when he beheld the extent of the disaster, for he occupied a seat commanding a clear view of the entire army—a lofty headland by the open sea.  Tearing his robes and uttering a loud cry, he straightaway gave orders to his force on land</l>
<l n="470">and dismissed them in disorderly flight.  This, besides the one already told, is the disaster you must bewail.

<l n="480">The commanders of the ships which still remained fled with a rush in disorder wherever the wind bore them.  As for the survivors of the army, they perished in Boeotian territory, some, faint from thirst, beside a refreshing spring, while some of us, exhausted and panting,</l>
               <l n="485">made our way to the land of the Phocians, to Doris and the Melian gulf, where the Spercheus waters the plain with kindly stream.  Coming from there, badly in need of food, we received welcome in the Achaean land and the cities of the Thessalians.</l>
<l n="490">There it was that many perished of thirst and hunger, for we were oppressed by both.  And we came to the Magnesian land and to the country of the Macedonians, to the ford of the <placeName key="tgn,7015932">Axius</placeName> and Bolbe’s reedy marsh, and to Mount Pangaeus,</l>
<l n="495">in the Edonian land.  But on that night the god roused winter before its time and froze the stream of sacred Strymon from shore to shore. Many a man who before that had held the gods in no esteem, implored them then in supplication, doing obeisance to earth and heaven.</l>
<l n="500">But when our host had made an end of its fervent invocation of the gods, it ventured to pass across the ice-bound stream.  And each of us who started on his way before the sun god dispersed his beams, found himself in safety, for the bright orb of the sun with its burning rays</l>
<l n="505">heated the middle section and pierced it with its flames.  One after another our men sank in, and fortunate indeed was he who perished soonest.  The survivors, after making their way through <placeName key="tgn,7001317">Thrace</placeName> with great hardship,</l>
<l n="510">—and few they were indeed—escaped to the safety of the land of their homes; now the city of the Persians may make lament in regret for the beloved youth of the land.

<l n="765">For Medus was first to be the leader of its host; and another, his son, completed his work since wisdom ruled his spirit.  Third, after him, Cyrus, blessed in good fortune, came to the throne and established peace for all his people.</l>
