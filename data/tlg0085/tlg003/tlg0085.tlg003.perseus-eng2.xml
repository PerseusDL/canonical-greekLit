<l n="5">upon the high craggy rocks in shackles of binding adamant that cannot be broken. For your own flower,  flashing fire, source of all arts, he has purloined and bestowed upon mortal creatures.  Such is his offence; for this he is bound to make requital to the gods,</l>
<l n="10">so that he may learn to bear with the sovereignty of Zeus and cease his man-loving ways.

<l n="12">Power and Force, for you indeed the behest of Zeus is now fulfilled, and nothing remains to stop you.  But for me—I do not have the nerve myself</l>
<l n="15">to bind with force a kindred god upon this rocky cleft assailed by cruel winter.  Yet, come what may, I am constrained to summon courage to this deed; for it is perilous to disregard the commandments of the Father.
   <milestone unit="para"/>Lofty-minded son of Themis who counsels straight, against my will, no less than yours, I must rivet you with brazen bonds</l>
<l n="20">no hand can loose to this desolate crag, where neither voice nor form of mortal man shall you perceive; but, scorched by the sun’s bright beams, you shall lose the fair bloom of your flesh.  And glad you shall be when spangled-robed night shall veil his brightness and</l>
<l n="25">when the sun shall scatter again the frost of morning.  Evermore the burden of your present ill shall wear you out; for your deliverer is not yet born.
   <milestone unit="para"/>Such is the prize you have gained for your championship of man.  For, god though you are, you did not fear the wrath of the gods, but</l>
<l n="30">you bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due.  Therefore on this joyless rock you must stand sentinel, erect, sleepless, your knee unbent.  And many a groan and unavailing lament you shall utter; for the heart of Zeus is hard,</l>
<l n="35">and everyone is harsh whose power is new.

<l n="950">but point by point, as the case exactly stands; and do not impose upon me a double journey, Prometheus—you see Zeus is not appeased by dealings such as yours.

<l n="955">Young you are, as young your power, and you think indeed that you inhabit heights beyond the reach of grief.  Have I not seen two sovereigns cast out from these heights?  A third, the present lord, I shall live to see  cast out in ruin most shameful and most swift.  Do you think</l>
<l n="960">I quail, perhaps, and cower before these upstart gods?  Far from it—no, not at all.  But scurry  back the way you came; for you shall learn nothing about which you question me.

<l n="1010">colt and struggle against the reins.  Yet it is a paltry device that prompts your vehemence, for in the foolish-minded mere self-will of itself avails less than anything at all.  But if you will not be won to belief by my words,</l>

<l n="1020">But when you have completed a long stretch of time, you shall come back again to the light.  Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fill</l>
