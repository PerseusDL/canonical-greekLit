                        work led to another which she added to it. Her city was divided into two
                        parts by the river that flowed through the middle. In the days of the former
                        rulers, when one wanted to go from one part to the other, one had to cross
                        in a boat; and this, I suppose, was a nuisance. But the queen also provided
                        for this; she made another monument of her reign out of this same work when
                        the digging of the basin of the lake was done. </p>

                        filling, the former channel now being dry, she bricked the borders of the
                        river in the city and the descent from the gate leading down to the river
                        with baked bricks, like those of the wall; and near the middle of the city
                        she built a bridge with the stones that had been dug up, binding them

                        so brittle that if you throw no more than a pebble it will pierce them, but
                        the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> skulls are so strong that a blow of

                        they drink; and this is how they get it: taking tubes of bone very much like
                        flutes, they insert these into the genitalia of the mares and blow into
                        them, some blowing while others milk. According to them, their reason for
                        doing this is that blowing makes the mare's veins swell and her udder drop.

                        everything, nor take account of all alike; If you wanted to take everything
                        equally into account on every occasion that happens, you would never do
                        anything; it is better to do everything boldly and suffer half of what you
                        dread than to fear all chances and so never suffer anything. </p>
