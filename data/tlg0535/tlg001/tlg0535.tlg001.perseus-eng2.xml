  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="1"><p rend="align(indent)">The laws have given you the right, Athenians, to acquit or punish men on trial. A doctor cannot treat his patients skilfully if he has not discerned the cause of the disease, nor can a member of a jury give a fair vote unless he has followed intelligently the rights and wrongs of the case. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="2"><p>Since I have myself become exposed to the full hatred of the orators, I am asking not only for divine assistance but for your help also. For they are casting aspersions on my personal history, thinking to undermine your confidence in my speech. I am of no consequence whether alive or dead; for what do the Athenians care if Demades is lost to them, too? No soldier will shed tears over my death—(How could he, when war brings him advancement and peace destroys his livelihood?); but it will be lamented by the farmer, the sailor, and everyone who has enjoyed the peaceful life with which I fortified <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, encircling its boundaries, not with stone, but with the safety of the city. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="3"><p>In many cases, gentlemen of the jury, when men are serving as judges they are seriously misled. For, just as a complaint of the eyes, by confusing the vision, prevents a man from seeing what lies before him, so an unjust speech, insinuating itself into the minds of the jury, prevents them in their anger from perceiving the truth. You should therefore exercise more care in dealing with the accused than with the plaintiffs. For the latter, by virtue of speaking first, have the jury in the mood which suits them, while the former are compelled to plead their cause to judges already prejudiced by anger. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="4"><p>Now, if you hold me liable for the charges, condemn me out of hand; I ask no pardon. But if, on considerations of justice, law, and expediency, I prove to be innocent of these charges, do not leave me to the savagery of my prosecutors. If my death will contribute in the least, as these men say, to the common safety, I am ready to die. For it is a noble thing to win public esteem by the loss of one’s own life, so long as it is given in answer to the country’s need and not the argument of these accusers. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="5"><p>I entreat you by the gods, Athenians, give me free scope to explain to you my claims to fair treatment. I have, I believe, the power even to be of assistance to others, but on this occasion fear restrains my speech. Apart from that I am not afraid that the facts will convict me; all I fear is my opponents’ slander which, instead of bringing wrongdoers to justice, attaches to any with a reputation as an orator or statesman. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="6"><p>The hopes I place in you are justified; for the sympathy of his hearers, when it is ranged on the side of justice, is no small factor in securing the acquittal of the accused. If I gain this I shall rebut all the calumnies; without it neither speech nor laws, nor the light of facts, can save a man unjustly brought to trial. I need not remind you that numerous prosecutors on many occasions in the past have, on the strength of their pleas, been thought to be urging a just case, but after a comparison with the defence they have been found to be themselves speaking falsely and I am convinced that my accusers now will have the same experience, if you consent to grant me a favorable hearing. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="7"><p rend="align(indent)">As they attempted to question the rest of my administration, I wish to make a few points in connexion with it and then to pass on to the remainder of my defence in order to prove their dishonesty to you. I am the son of Demeas, Athenians, as the elder ones among you know, and the early part of my life I lived as best I could, neither doing harm to the community nor troubling any individual in the city. I merely persisted in trying, by my own efforts, to better my humble position. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="8"><p>Penury may involve inconvenience and hardship but it carries with it no discredit, since poverty is frequently, I imagine, a mark not of weakness of character but of sheer misfortune. When I entered public life I did not concentrate on lawsuits or the perquisites to be derived from writing speeches but on speaking freely from the platform, a practice which makes the lives of orators dangerous but holds out the clearest opportunities of success, if men are careful<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" ><foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐλαβουμένοις</foreign>, too, clearly refers to the hearers, not to the orators, an therefore the sense is the same as that given by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐλαβῶς ἀκροωμένοις</foreign>, even if we do not adopt that emendation.</note>; for, though they succumb to the speaker, their country’s safety must not also fall a victim. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="9"><p>I have, to bear me out, the burial of a thousand Athenians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It is said that after <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName> in <date when="-0338">338</date> B.C. Philip was insulting his prisoners, until Demades, by his frank speech, won him over to a better attitude towards <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName>. Cf. <bibl n="Diod. 16.87">Dio. Sic. 16.87</bibl>.</note> performed by the hands of our adversaries, hands which I won over from enmity to friendship towards the dead. Then, on coming to the fore in public life, I proposed the peace. I admit it. I proposed honors to Philip. I do not deny it. By making these proposals I gained for you two thousand captives free of ransom, a thousand Athenian dead, for whom no herald had to ask, and Oropus without an embassy. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="10"><p>The hand that wrote them was constrained, not by Macedonian gifts, as my accusers falsely allege, but by the need of the moment, the interest of my country, and the generosity of the king. For he entered the war as our foe but emerged from the struggle as a friend, awarding to the vanquished the prize of the victors. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="11"><p>Again, there came a second crisis for the city; for I deliberately ignore the intervening dangers. All other inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> were promoting Alexander to the rank of leader, and by remoulding him in their decrees they raised the aspirations of a young and ambitious man to an excessive pitch. We and the Spartans remained, with neither revenues nor armaments nor regiments of infantry to be the bulwark of our safety, yet fortified by a great desire, though our power was small and humble. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="12"><p>The Spartans had been deprived of their strength by the battle of Leuctra<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n=">Din. 1.73">Din. 1.73</bibl>, note.</note>, and the Eurotas, which had never yet heard an enemy trumpet, saw Boeotians camping in <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. For the Theban had cut off the bloom of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, enveloping in ashes the flower of her young men, the established boundaries of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. Our own resources were spent with war and the hopes of the survivors were oppressed by the fate of the dead. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="13"><p>The Thebans were suffering the closest restriction in the Macedonian garrison<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the garrison established in the Cadmea by Philip after <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.</note> which bound their hands together and had even deprived them of their freedom of speech. Time buried the power of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> with the body of Epaminonidas. The Macedonians had reached their full strength, and in their aspirations Fortune was already leading them across the sea against the throne and treasuries of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="14"><p>Then too Demosthenes decided upon war, offering to his compatriots counsel which, though seemingly prudent, was in reality fraught with danger.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">After the accession of Alexander in <date when="-0336">336</date> B.C.

But in the same year, when Alexander entered <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> retracted. Demades apparently negotiated the ensuing agreement, but we have no other evidence to confirm the statement made in this passage.</note> When the enemy was encamped near <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> and the country was being confined in the town, when the city, worthy to be striven for and marvelled at by all, was being filled like a stable with oxen, sheep and flocks and there was no hope of help from any quarter, I proposed the peace. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="15"><p>I admit it and I maintain that it is an honorable and expedient course to have taken. For it is better to shun the cloud as it approaches than to be swept away in the rush of the flood. I ask, Athenians, that the grief occasioned by events shall not engender in you any bitterness against me. For I have no mastery over Fortune; it is Fortune which controls life and gives it its danger. The counsellor, like the doctor, must not take blame for the disease; he must be thanked for the cure. </p></div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0535.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="16"><p>Discount, therefore, what happened from extraneous causes and simply examine my policy naked in the light of facts.
