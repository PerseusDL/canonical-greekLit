       <p>After the disaster of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName> the Athenian people passed a decree forbidding persons to leave the city or to remove their wives or children. Now a certain Leocrates left the city and, after going to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> and later <placeName key="perseus,Megara" >Megara</placeName>, returned to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. He made no secret of his story and so was accused of treason by Lycurgus. The case must be classified as an instance of contradictory definition, since Leocrates admits that he left the city but denies that he betrayed it. Others class it as an instance of conjecture as to intention, since it is admitted that the accused left the city, while his purpose in leaving it is doubtful: did he wish to be a traitor or only to trade? Others think it an instance of counterplea, since he claims that he left the city not with treasonable intentions but for commerce. The subject matter resembles that of the speech against Autolycus. </p>

          gods, shall mark the opening of my speech against Leocrates, now here on trial; so may
          Athena and those other gods and heroes whose statues are erected in our city and the
          country round receive this prayer. If I have done justly to prosecute Leocrates, if he
          whom I now bring to trial has been a traitor to their temples, shrines and precincts, a
          traitor to the honors which your laws ordain and the sacrificial rituals which your
          ancestors have handed down, </p>

        <p>may they make me on this day, in the interest of the city and its people, a worthy
          accuser of his crimes; and may you, who in your deliberation now are defending your
          fathers, wives and children, your country and your temples, who hold at the mercy of your
          vote one who has betrayed all these things, be inexorable judges, now and in future,
          towards all who break the laws on such a scale as this. But if the man whom I am now
          bringing to trial neither betrayed his country nor forsook his city and its temples, I
          pray that he may be saved from danger by the gods and you, the members of the jury. </p>

        <p rend="align(indent)">Gentlemen, it is a privilege for the city to have within
          it those who prosecute transgressors of the law, and I could wish to find among the public
          an appropriate sense of gratitude. In fact the opposite is true, and anyone who takes the
          personal risk of unpopularity for our common good is actually regarded as an interferer
          rather than a patriot, which makes neither for justice nor the state’s advantage. For the
          things which in the main uphold our democracy and preserve the city’s prosperity are three
          in number: </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0034.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="4">
        <p>first the system of law, second the vote of the jury, and third the method of prosecution
          by which the crimes are handed over to them. The law exists to lay down what must not be
          done, the accuser to report those liable to penalties under the law, and the juryman to
          punish all whom these two agencies have brought to his attention. And thus both law and
          jury’s vote are powerless without an accuser who will hand transgressors over to them.
        </p>

      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0034.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="5">
        <p>I myself, Athenians, knew that Leocrates avoided the dangers to which his country called
          him and deserted his fellow citizens. I knew that he had utterly disregarded your
          authority and was chargeable with all the articles of the indictment. Therefore I
          instituted these proceedings. It was not out of hatred in the least nor with the slightest
          wish to be contentious that I undertook this trial; but I thought it monstrous to allow
          this man to push into the market place and share the public sacrifices, when he had been a
          disgrace to his country and to you all. </p>

        <p>A just citizen will not let private enmity induce him to start a public prosecution
          against one who does the state no harm. On the contrary, it is those who break his
          country’s laws whom he will look on as his personal enemies; crimes which affect the
          public will, in his eyes, offer public grounds for enmity towards the criminals. </p>

        <p rend="align(indent)">All public trials should therefore rank as important, but
          particularly this present one, in which you are about to cast your vote. For when you give
          a verdict on a charge of illegal proposals you merely rectify one single error, and in
          preventing the intended measure your scope depends upon the extent to which the decree in
          question will harm the city. But the present case is not concerned with some trifling
          constitutional issue, nor yet with a moment of time; our city’s whole life is at stake,
          and this trial will leave a verdict to posterity to be remembered for all time. </p>

      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0034.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="8">
        <p>So dangerous is the wrong which has been done and so far-reaching that no indictment
          adequate could be devised, nor have the laws defined a punishment for the crimes. What
          punishment would suit a man who left his country and refused to guard the temples of his
          fathers, who abandoned the graves of his ancestors and surrendered the whole country into
          the hands of the enemy? The greatest and final penalty, death, though the maximum
          punishment allowed by law, is too small for the crimes of Leocrates. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0034.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="9">
        <p>The reason why the penalty for such offences, gentlemen, has never been recorded is not
          that the legislators of the past were neglectful; it is that such things had not happened
          hitherto and were not expected to happen in the future. It is therefore most essential
          that you should be not merely judges of this present case but lawmakers besides. For where
          a crime has been defined by some law, it is easy, with that as a standard, to punish the
          offender. But where different offences are not specifically included in the law, being
          covered by a single designation, and where a man has committed crimes worse than these and
          is equally chargeable with them all, your verdict must be left as a precedent for your
          successors. </p>

        <p>I assure you, gentlemen, that if you condemn this man you will do more than merely punish
          him; you will be giving all younger men an incentive to right conduct. For there are two
          influences at work in the education of the young: the punishments suffered by wrongdoers
          and the reward available to the virtuous. With these alternatives before their eyes they
          are deterred by fear from the one and attracted by desire for honor to the other. You must
          therefore give your minds to the trial on hand and let your first consideration be
          justice. </p>

        <p rend="align(indent)">In my speech also justice shall come first; on no occasion
          will I have recourse to falsehoods or irrelevance. Most of the speakers who come before
          you behave in the strangest possible manner, either giving you advice from the platform on
          public affairs or wasting their charges and calumnies on any subject except the one on
          which you are going to vote. Either course is easy, whether they choose to express an
          opinion on questions about which you are not deliberating or else to invent a charge to
          which no one is going to reply. </p>

        <p>But it is wrong that they should ask for justice from you when you give your vote and yet
          be unjust themselves in handling the prosecution. And yet the blame for this is yours,
          gentlemen; for you have granted this freedom to speakers appearing before you, although
          you have, in the council of the Areopagus, the finest model in <placeName
            key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>: a court so superior to others that even the men
          convicted in it admit that its judgements are just. </p>

        <p>Let it be your pattern, and, like it, do not give way to speakers who digress from the
          point. If you take this advice, defendants will receive an unbiased hearing, accusers will
          be least able to give false information, and you will best be able to make the verdict in
          keeping with your oath. For those who have not been rightly informed cannot give their
          verdict rightly. </p>

        <p rend="align(indent)">A further point for you to notice, gentlemen, is this: the
          trial of Leocrates is not comparable with that of other ordinary men. For if the defendant
          were unknown in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, your verdict, whether
          good or bad, would be a matter solely for yourselves to contemplate. But where this man is
          concerned, whatever judgement you may give will be discussed by every Greek, since it is
          common knowledge that the conduct of your ancestors was just the opposite of his. He won
          notoriety by his voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> and the
          discreditable report of you which he made officially to the Rhodians and to those
          merchants residing there; </p>

        <p>merchants who sailed round the whole Greek world on their business and passed on the news
          of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> which they had heard from Leocrates.
          It is important therefore to reach a correct verdict upon him. For you must realize,
          Athenians, that you would be held to have neglected the virtues which chiefly distinguish
          you from the rest of mankind, piety towards the gods, reverence for your ancestors and
          ambition for your country, if this man were to escape punishment at your hands. </p>

          slaves’ assistance placed them in the ship’s boat, the ship itself being already anchored
          off the shore. Late in the evening he went out himself with his mistress Irenis through
          the postern gate on to the open beach and sailed out to the ship. And so he disappeared, a
          deserter, untouched by pity for the city’s harbors from which he was putting out to sea,

          charges of the indictment are true. Every one of you knows that in matters of dispute it
          is considered by far the justest and most democratic course, when there are male or female
          slaves, who possess the necessary information, to examine these by torture and so have

            slave witnesses does not seem often to have been exercised, and it is doubtful whether
            evidence obtained in this way was really very highly rated. No man was bound to submit
            his slaves for examination, and accusers often demanded them in such a way as to ensure
            a refusal which gave them an additional argument against the defendant. To strengthen
            their position they naturally tried, as Lycurgus does here, to impress the jury with the
            value of such evidence (cf. <bibl n="Isaeus 8.12">Isaeus 8.12</bibl> etc.): but Antiphon
            must be nearer the mark when he points out that a man on the rack would say anything to

          who by certain proofs expose the criminal will be produced from the same household as the

          of Erechtheus who was married to Praxithea, the daughter of Cephisus.<note anchored="true"

            the earliest extant source for the tradition that he was a Thracian. According to

            committing suicide in sympathy, and so was enabled to kill Eumolpus in battle (<bibl

          deeds. They were right to do so. Laws are too brief to give instruction: they merely state

        <p>It is with this in mind, gentlemen, that many have approached me and asked why I did not
          include in the indictment the charge that he had betrayed his father’s statue, dedicated
          in the temple of Zeus the Savior. Gentlemen, I fully realized that this offence called for
          the most severe punishment, but I did not think it right, when prosecuting the defendant
          for treason, to add the name of Zeus the Savior to the bill of indictment. </p>

          defendants for a fee, you do not realize that they deserve to feel your anger in its
          fullest violence. If they and their kind defend the criminals it is proof that they would
          associate themselves with the actual crimes. It is to defend you, in the interests of
          democracy and law, not to oppose you, that a speaker should have acquired his skill. </p>

          to deceive you; they will even cite their own public services in favor of the defendants.

          their own families, they are now asking you for public token of thanks.

            on richer citizens who were nominated from each tribe in turn. The trierarch had to
            contribute towards the equipment and maintenance of a ship, of which the state supplied
            the hull and usually the oars and rigging. He was also responsible for the command of
            it. For further details see note on <bibl n="Hyp. Fr. 43">Hyp. Fr. 43</bibl>.</note> a
          handsome payment for a chorus, and other expensive gestures, do not entitle a man to any
          such recognition from you, since for these acts he alone is crowned, conferring no benefit
          on others. To earn your gratitude he must, instead, have been distinguished as a
          trierarch, or built walls to protect his city, or subscribed generously from his own
          property for the public safety. These are services to the state: </p>

          guilty of overthrowing the democracy, because he did not face the danger which is the
          price of freedom; guilty of impiety, because he has done all in his power to have the
          sacred precincts ravaged and the temples destroyed. He is guilty too of injuring his
