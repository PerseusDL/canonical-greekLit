<head>Prometheus
<note xml:lang="eng">The mock-plea Prometheus, clearly suggested by the opening of the Prometheus Bound of Aeschylus, is midway between the Menippean satires and the pure genre of the Dialogues of the Gods, in one of which (5, formerly 1) the Titan figures again. In some of the manuscripts it bears a sub-title, The Caucasus, possibly added to distinguish it from A Literary Prometheus.</note></head>
<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Well, Hephaestus, here is the Caucasus, where
this poor Titan will have to be nailed up. Now then
let us look about for a suitable rock, if there is a place
anywhere that has no snow on it, so that the irons
may be riveted in more firmly and he may be in full
sight of everybody as he hangs there.
</p>
<p><label>HEPHAESTUS</label>
Yes, let’s look about, Hermes : we mustn't crucify
him low and close to the ground for fear that men,
his own handiwork, may come to his aid, nor yet on
the summit, either, for he would be out of sight
from below. Suppose we crucify him half way up,
somewhere hereabouts over the ravine, with his
hands outstretched from this rock to that one ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Right you are; the cliffs are sheer and inaccessible
on every side, and overhang slightly, and the rock
has only this narrow foothold, so that one can barely
stand on tip toe ; in short, it will make a very handy
cross. Well, Prometheus, don’t hang back: climb
up and let yourself be riveted to the mountain.

<pb n="v.2.p.245"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Come, Hephaestus and Hermes, at any rate you
might pity me in my undeserved misfortune.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
You mean, be crucified in your stead the instant
we disobey the order! Don’t you suppose the
Caucasus has room enough to hold two more pegged
up? Come, hold out your right hand. Secure
it, Hephaestus, and nail it up, and bring your
hammer down with a will. Give me the other hand
too. Let that be well secured also. That’s good.
The eagle will soon fly down to eat away your liver,
so that you may have full return for your beautiful
and clever handiwork in clay.

</p></div>

<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
O Cronus and Iapetus and you, O mother (Earth)!
What a fate I suffer, luckless that I am, when I
have done no harm.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
No harm, Prometheus? In the first place you
undertook to serve out our meat and did it so unfairly and trickily that you abstracted all the best
of it for yourself and cheated Zeus by wrapping
“bones in glistening fat”: for I remember that
Hesiod says so.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.245.n.1">Theogony 541. The story was invented to account for the burning of bones wrapped in fat at sacrifice.</note> Then you made human beings,
thoroughly unprincipled creatures, particularly the
women; and to top all, you stole fire, the most
valued possession of the gods, and actually gave that
to men. When you have done so much harm, do
you say that you have been put in irons without
having done any wrong?

<pb n="v.2.p.247"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Hermes, you seem to be “blaming a man who is
blameless,” to speak with the poet,<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.247.n.1">[liad 13, 775.</note> for you reproach
me with things for which I should have sentenced
myself to maintenance in the Prytaneum if justice
were being done.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.247.n.2">After Socrates has been found guilty, his accusers proposed that he be condemned to death. He made a counterproposition that he be allowed to dine at the Prytaneum for the rest of his life, on the ground that he deserved this privilege better and needed it more than did the Olympic chainpions to whom it was accorded.</note> At any rate, if you have time, I
should be glad to stand trial on the charges, so that
I might prove that Zeus has passed an unjust sentence on me. As you are ready-tongued and litigious,
suppose you plead in his behalf that he was just in
his decision that I be crucified near the Caspian gates
here in the Caucasus, a most piteous spectacle for all
the Scythians.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Your appeal, Prometheus, will be tardy and of no
avail, but say your say just the same; for in any case
we must remain here until the eagle flies down to
attend to your liver. This interval of leisure may as
well be employed in listening to a sophistic speech,
as you are a very clever scoundrel at speech-making.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Speak first, then, Hermes, and see that you accuse
me as eloquently as you can and that you don’t
neglect any of your father’s claims. Hephaestus, I
make you judge.
</p>
<p><label>HEPHAESTUS</label>
No, by Heaven; you will find me an accuser

<pb n="v.2.p.249"/>

instead of a judge, I promise you, for you abstracted
my fire and left my forge cold.
</p>
<p><label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Well, then, divide the accusation ; you can accuse
me of the theft now, and then Hermes will
criticize the serving of the meat and the making of
men. You both belong to trades-unions and are
likely to be good at speaking.
</p>
<p><label>HEPHAESTUS</label>
Hermes shall speak for me too, for I am no hand
at court specches but stick by my forge for the most
part, while he is an orator and has taken uncommon
interest in such matters.
</p>
<p><label>PROMETHEUS</label>
I should never have thought that Hermes would
care to speak about the theft or to reproach me
with anything like that, when I follow his own trade !
However, if you agree to this, son of Maea, it is high
time you were getting on with your accusation.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Just as if long speeches and adequate preparation
were necessary, Prometheus, and it were not enough
simply to summarize your wrong-doings and say that
when you were commissioned to divide the meat you
tried to keep the best for yourself “and cheat the
king, and that you made men when you should not,
and that you stole fire from us and took it to them!
You do not seem to realize, my excellent friend, that
you have found Zeus very humane in view of such
actions. Now if you deny that you have committed
them, I shall have to have it out with you and make
a long speech and try my best to bring out the truth;
but if you admit that you served the meat in that

<pb n="v.2.p.251"/>

way and made the innovations in regard to men and
stole fire, my accusation is sufficient and I don’t
care to say any more; to do so would be a mere
waste of words.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Perhaps what you have said is also a waste of
words ; we shall see a little later! But as you say
your accusation is sufficient, I shall try as best I can
to dissipate the charges. And first let me tell you
about the meat. By Heaven, even now as I speak
of it I blush for Zeus, if he is so mean and fault-finding as to send a prehistoric god like me to be
crucified just because he found a small bone in his
portion, without remembering how we fought side
by side or thinking how slight the ground for his
anger is and how. childish it is to “be angry and
enraged unless he gets the lion’s share himself.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Deceptions of that sort, Hermes, occurring at table,
should not be remembered, but if a mistake is made
among people who are having a good time, it should
be considered a practical joke and one’s anger should
be left behind there in the dining room. To store
up one’s hatred against the morrow, to hold spite
and to cherish a stale grudge—come, it is not seemly
for gods and in any case not kingly. Anyhow, if
dinners are deprived of these attractions, of trickery,
jokes, mockery and ridicule, all that is left is drunkenness, repletion and silence; gloomy, joyless things,
all of them, not in the least appropriate to a dinner.
So I should not have thought that Zeus would even

<pb n="v.2.p.253"/>

remember the affair until the next day, to say nothing
of taking on so about it and considering he had
been horribly treated if someone in serving meat
played a joke to see if the chooser could tell which
was the better portion.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Suppose, however, Hermes, that it was more
serious—that instead of giving Zeus the smaller
portion I had abstracted the whole of it—what then?
Just because of that ought he to have mingled earth
with heaven, as the saying goes, and ought he to
conjure up irons and crosses and a whole Caucasus
and send down eagles and pick out my liver?
Doesn’t all this accuse the angered man himself of
great pettiness and meanness of disposition and
readiness to get angry? What would he have done
in ease he had been choused out of a whole ox, if
he wreaks such mighty deeds about a little meat ?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
How much more good-natured human beings are
about such things! One would expect them to be
more quick to wrath than the gods, but in spite of
that there is not one among them who would
propose to crucify his cook if “he dipped his finger
into the broth while the meat was boiling and
licked off a little, or if he pulled off a bit of the
roast and gobbled it up. No, they pardon them.
To be sure, if they are extremely angry, they give
them a slap or hit them over the head ; but among
them nobody was ever crucified on so trivial a
ground.
So much for the meat—an unseemly plea for me to
make, but a far more unseemly accusation for him to
bring ;

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
and now it is time to speak of my handiwork
and the fact that I made men. This embodies a

<pb n="v.2.p.255"/>

twofold accusation, Hermes, and I don’t know which
charge you bring against me—that men should not
have been created at all but would better have been
left alone as mere clay, or that they should have
been made, as far as that goes, but fashioned after
some other pattern than this. However, I shall
speak to both charges. In the first place I shall try
to show that it has done the gods no harm to bring
men into the world, and then that this is actually
advantageous, far better for them than if the earth
had happened to remain deserted and unpeopled.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

There existed, then, in time gone by (for if I
begin there it will be easier to see whether I have
done any wrong in my alterations and innovations
with regard to men) there existed, as I say, only the
divine, the heavenly race. The earth was a rude
and ugly thing all shaggy with woods, and wild
woods at that, and there were no divine altars or
temples—how could there be ?—or images or anything else of the sort, though they are now to be
seen in great numbers everywhere, honoured with
every form of observance. But as I am always
planning something for the common good and considering how the condition of the gods may be
improved and everything else may increase in order
and in beauty, it occurred to me that it would be a
good idea to take a little bit of clay and create a
few living things, making them like us in appearance; for I thought that divinity was not quite
complete in the absence of its counterpart, comparison with which would show divinity to be the

<pb n="v.2.p.257"/>

happier state. This should be mortal, I thought,
but highly inventive and intelligent and able to
appreciate what was better.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

And then, “water and
earth intermingling,” in the words of the poet,<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.257.n.1">Hesiod, Works and Days 61.</note> and
kneading them, I moulded men, inviting Athena,
moreover, to give me a hand in the task. Therein
lies the great wrong I have done the gods, and you
see what the penalty is for making creatures out of
mud and imparting motion to that which was
formerly motionless. From that time on, it would
seem, the gods are less of gods because on earth a
few mortal creatures have come into being! Indeed,
Zeus is actually as angry as though the gods were
losing caste through the creation of men. Surely he
doesn’t’ fear that they will plot an insurrection
against him and make war on the gods as the Giants
did ?</p>
<p>No, Hermes, that you gods have suffered no wrong
through me and my works is self-evident; come,
show me even one wrong of the smallest sort, and I
will hold my tongue and own that I have had the
treatment that I deserved at your hahds.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
On the
contrary, that my creation has been actually of
service to the gods you will learn if you notice that
the whole earth is no longer barren and unbeautiful
but adorned with cities and tilled lands and cultivated
plants, that the sea is sailed and the islands are
inhabited, and that everywhere there are altars and
sacrifices, temples and festivals,

<cit><quote><l>and full of God are all the streets</l>
<l>And all the marts of men.</l></quote>
<bibl>Aratus, Phaenomena2-3.</bibl></cit>




<pb n="v.2.p.259"/>

If I had made men to keep just for myself, I should
be selfish, no doubt ; but as the case stands I have
contributed them to the general fund for your
benefit. In fact, there are temples to Zeus, to Apollo,
to Hera and to you, Hermes, in sight everywhere,
but nowhere any to Prometheus. You see how I
look out for my own interests, but betray and injure
those of the community !

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

Moreover, Hermes, please consider this point too—
do you think that any choice thing unattested,
something that you get or make, for instance, which
nobody is going to see or to praise, will give quite as
much joy and pleasure to its owner? Why did I
ask that question? Because if men had not been
created, it would follow that the beauty of the
universe would be unattested and it would be our
lot to possess wealth, so to speak, which no one else
would admire and we ourselves would not prize so
highly ; for we should have nothing else to compare
it with, and we should not realise how happy we
were if we did not see others who did not have what
we have. What is great, you know, can only seem
great if it is gauged by something small. You should
have honoured me for that stroke of policy, but you
have crucified me and have given me this return for
my plan.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

But there are rascals, you say, among them, and
they commit adultery and make war and mar ry their
sisters and plot against their fathers. Why, are
there not plenty of them among us? Yet, of course,
fone could not on this account blame Heaven and
Earth for creating us. Again, you may perhaps say
that we have to undergo a great deal of annoyance
in taking care of them. Well, then, on that principle

<pb n="v.2.p.261"/>

the herdsman ought to be vexed over having his herd
because he has to take care of it. But this toilsome
task is also sweet, and, in general, business is not devoid of pleasure, for it affords occupation. Why, what
should we do if we had not them to provide for?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
Be
idle and drink our nectar and eat our ambrosia without doing anything! But what sticks in my throat
most is that although you censure me for making
men “and particularly the women,” you fall in love
with them just the same, and are always going down
below, transformed now into bulls, now into satyrs
and swans, and you deign to beget gods upon
them!</p>


<p>
Perhaps, however, you will say that men should
have been made, but in some other form and not like
us. What better model could I have put before
myself than this, which I knew to be beautiful in
every way? Should I have made my creatures
unintelligent and bestial and savage? Why, how
could they have sacrificed to gods or bestowed all
the other honours upon you if they were not as
they are? You gods do not hang back when they
bring you the hecatombs, even if you have to go to
the river of Ocean,
<cit><quote><l>to the Ethiopians guileless,</l></quote>
<bibl>Ilad1, 423.</bibl></cit>

yet
you have crucified him who procured you your
honours and your sacrifices.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

So much for men; and now, if you wish, I shall
pass to fire and that reprehensible theft! In the
name of the gods answer me this question without
any hesitation; have we lost any fire since men
have had it too? You can’t say that we have.
The nature of that possession is such, I suppose,
that it is not diminished if anyone else takes some


<pb n="v.2.p.263"/>

of it, for it does not go out when a light is procured
from it. But surely it is downright stinginess to
prevent things from being shared with those who
need them when it does you no harm to share them.
Inasmuch as you are gods, you ought to be kindly
and
<cit><quote><l>bestowers of blessings</l></quote>
<bibl>Od, 8, 325.</bibl></cit>
and to stand aloof
from all stinginess. In this case even if I had filched
all your fire and taken it down to earth without
leaving a bit of it behind, I should not be guilty
of any great wrong-doing against you, for you yourselves have no need of it, as you do not get cold and
do not cook your ambrosia and do not require artificial light.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg020.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

On the other hand, men are obliged to
use fire, not only for other purposes but above all for
the sacrifices, in order that they may be able “to fill
the ways with savour” and to burn incense and consume meat on the altars. Indeed, I notice that you
all take particular pleasure in the smoke and think it
the most delightful of banquets when the savour
comes up to heaven

<cit><quote><l>curling about the smoke.</l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad1, 317.</bibl></cit>


This criticism, therefore, is directly opposed to your
own desire. I wonder, moreover, that you haven’t
prevented the sun from shining on men, for he is fire
too, and of a far more divine and ardent sort. Do
you find fault with him for dissipating your property?
I have said my say. Now then, Hermes and
Hephaestus, if you think I have said anything wrong
take me to task and confute me, and I will plead in
reply.

<label>HERMES</label>
It is not an easy matter, Prometheus, to rival such
an accomplished sophist. You are lucky, however,

<pb n="v.2.p.265"/>

that Zeus did not hear you say all this, for I am
very sure he would have set sixteen vultures upon
you to pull out your vitals, so eloquently did you
accuse him in seeming to defend yourself. But I
am surprised that as you are a prophet you did not
know in advance that you would be punished for all
this.
</p>
<p><label>PROMETHEUS</label>
I did know it, Hermes, and I also know that
I shall be set free again; before long someone will

down the eagle which you say will fly to me.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
I hope so, Prometheus, and I hope to see you at
large, feasting with us all—but not serving our meat !

<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Never fear, I shall feast with you, and Zeus will
set me free in return for a considerable favour.

What favour? Don’t hesitate to tell us.
</p>
<p><label>PROMETHEUS</label>
You know Thetis, Hermes ?—but I must not tell.
It is best to keep the secret, so that I may be
rewarded and set free instead of being sentenced.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.265.n.2">The secret is told in Dialogues of the Gods, 5.</note>
<label>HERMES</label>
Why, keep it, Titan, if it is best that way. Let’s
be going, Hephaestus, for here is the eagle close by.
(To Prometheus.) Well, hold out stubbornly. I
hope the Theban archer you speak of, will soon
disclose himself to you, to stop you from being
dissected by the bird.
