<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Pollux, I have a commission for you; next time you go up—and I think it is your turn for earth to-morrow—if you come across Menippus the Cynic—you will find him about the Craneum at Corinth, or in the Lyceum, laughing at the philosophers’ disputes—well, give him this message:—Menippus, Diogenes advises you, if mortal subjects for laughter begin to pall, to come down below, and find much richer material; where you are now, there is always a dash of uncertainty in it; the question will always intrude—who can be quite sure about the hereafter? Here, you can have your laugh out in security, like me; it is the best of sport to see millionaires, governors, despots, now mean and insignificant; you can only tell them by their lamentations, and the spiritless despondency which is the legacy of better days. Tell him this, and mention that he had better stuff his wallet with plenty of lupines, and any unconsidered trifles he can snap up in the way of pauper doles<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.107.n.1"> In the Greek, 'a Hecate’s repast lying at a street corner.' 'Rich men used to make offerings to Hecate on the 30th of every month as Goddess of roads at street corners; and these offerings were at once pounced upon by the poor, or, as here, the Cynics.' Jacobitz.</note> or lustral eggs<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.107.n.2">'Eggs were often used as purificatory offerings and set out in front of the house purified.’ Jacobitz.</note>. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>I will tell him, Diogenes. But give me some idea of his appearance.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Old, bald, with a cloak that allows him plenty of light <pb n="v.1.p.108"/> and ventilation, and is patched all colours of the rainbow; always laughing, and usually gibing at pretentious philosophers,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>Ah, I cannot mistake him now.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>May I give you another message to those same philosophers?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>Oh, I don’t mind; go on.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Charge them generally to give up playing the fool, quarrelling over metaphysics, tricking each other with horn and crocodile puzzles,<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.108.n.1">See Puzzles in Notes.</note> and teaching people to waste wit on such absurdities.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>Oh, but if I say anything against their wisdom, they will call me an ignorant blockhead.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Then tell them from me to go to the devil.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>Very well; rely upon me. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>And then, my most obliging of Polluxes, there is this for the rich:—O vain fools, why hoard gold? why all these pains over interest sums and the adding of hundred to hundred, when you must shortly come to us with nothing beyond the dead-penny?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>They shall have their message too.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Ah, and a word to the handsome and strong; Megillus of Corinth, and Damoxenus the wrestler will do. Inform them that auburn locks, eyes bright or black, rosy cheeks, are as little in fashion here as tense muscles or mighty shoulders; man and man are as like as two peas, tell them, when it comes to bare skull and no beauty.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>That is to the handsome and strong; yes, I can manage that. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Yes, my Spartan, and here is for the poor. There are a great many of them, very sorry for themselves and resentful of their helplessness. Tell them to dry their tears and cease their cries; explain to them that here one man is as good as <pb n="v.1.p.109"/> another, and they will find those who were rich on earth no better than themselves. As for your Spartans, -you will not mind scolding them, from me, upon their present degeneracy?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pollux</speaker> 
<p>No, no, Diogenes; leave Sparta alone; that is going too far; your other commissions I will execute.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Oh, well, let them off, if you care about it; but tell all the others what I said. </p></sp></div>  <docAuthor>Henry Watson Fowler</docAuthor> </div>

<sp><speaker>Croesus</speaker> 
<p>Pluto, we can stand this snarling Cynic no longer in our neighbourhood; either you must transfer him to other quarters, or we are going to migrate,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Why, what harm does he do to your ghostly community?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Croesus</speaker> 
<p>Midas here, and Sardanapalus and I, can never get in a good cry over the old days of gold and luxury and treasure, but he must be laughing at us, and calling us rude names; ‘slaves’ and ‘garbage,’ he says we are. And then he sings; and that throws us out.—In short, he is a nuisance,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Menippus, what’s this I hear?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>All perfectly true, Pluto. I detest these abject rascals! Not content with having lived the abominable lives they did, they keep on talking about it now they are dead, and harping on the good old days. I take a positive pleasure in annoying them,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Yes, but you mustn’t. They have had terrible losses; they feel it deeply.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>Pluto! you are not going to lend your countenance to these whimpering fools?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>It isn’t that; but I won’t have you quarrelling. </p></sp></div>  

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg066.perseus-eng4:2" n="2"> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>Well, you scum of your respective nations, let there be no misunderstanding: I am going on just the same. Wherever <pb n="v.1.p.110"/> you are, there shall I be also; worrying, jeering, singing you down.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Croesus</speaker> 
<p>Presumption!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>Not a bit of it. Yours was the presumption, when you expected men to fall down before you, when you trampled on men’s liberty, and forgot there was such a thing as death. Now comes the weeping and gnashing of teeth: for all is lost!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Croesus</speaker> 
<p>Lost! Ah God! My treasure-heapp——</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>Now I wonder how it is that you two dead men have been honoured with temples and taken for prophets; those silly mortals imagine you are Gods.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Ampbilochus</speaker> 
<p>How can we help it, if they are fools enough to have such fancies about the dead?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>Ah, they would never have had them, though, if you had not been charlatans in your lifetime, and pretended to know the future and be able to foretell it to your clients.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Trophonius</speaker> 
<p>Well, Menippus, Amphilochus can take his own line, if he likes; as for me, I am a Hero, and do give oracles to any one who comes down to me. It is pretty clear you were never at Lebadea, or you would not be so incredulous. </p></sp></div>  

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg066.perseus-eng4:3" n="2">  
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>What do you mean? I must go to Lebadea, swaddle myself up in absurd linen, take a cake in my hand, and crawl through a narrow passage into a cave, before I could tell that you are a dead man, with nothing but knavery to differentiate <pb n="v.1.p.111"/> you from the rest of us? Now, on your seer-ship, what is a Hero? I am sure I don’t know.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Trophonius</speaker> 
<p>He is half God, and half man,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>So what is neither man (as you imply) nor God, is both at once? Well, at present what has become of your diviner half?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Trophonius</speaker> 
<p>He gives oracles in Boeotia.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>What you may mean is quite beyond me; the one thing I know for certain is that you are dead—the whole of you. </p></sp></div> </div>

<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>Ferryman, what do you say to settling up accounts? It will prevent any unpleasantness later on.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>Very good. It does save trouble to get these things straight.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>One anchor, to your order, five shillings.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>That is a lot of money.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>So help me Pluto, it is what I had to pay. One rowlock-strap, fourpence,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>Five and four; put that down.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>Then there was a needle, for mending the sail; tenpence.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>Down with it.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>Caulking-wax; nails; and cord for the brace. Two shillings the lot.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>They were worth the money.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>That’s all; unless I have forgotten anything. When will you pay it?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>I can’t just now, Hermes; we shall have a war or a plague presently, and then the passengers will come shoaling in, and I shall be able to make a little by jobbing the fares. <pb n="v.1.p.112"/> </p></sp></div>  

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg066.perseus-eng4:4" n="2"> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>So for the present I have nothing to do but sit down, and pray for the worst, as my only chance of getting paid?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>There is nothing else for it;—very little business doing just now, as you see, owing to the peace.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>That is just as well, though it does keep me waiting for my money. After all, though, Charon, in old days men were men; you remember the state they used to come down in,—all blood and wounds generally. Nowadays, a man is poisoned by his slave or his wife; or gets dropsy from overfeeding; a pale, spiritless lot, nothing like-the men of old. Most of them seem to meet their end in some plot that has money for its object.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Charon</speaker> 
<p>Ah; money is in great request.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>Yes; you can’t blame me if I am somewhat urgent for payment. </p></sp></div>  <docAuthor>Francis George Fowler</docAuthor> </div>

<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>You know that old, old fellow, Eucrates the millionaire— no children, but a few thousand would-be heirs?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>Yes—lives at Sicyon. Well?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Well, Hermes, he is ninety now; let him live as much longer, please; I should like it to be more still, if possible; and bring me down his toadies one by one, that young Charinus, Damon, and the rest of them.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>It would seem so strange, wouldn’t it?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>On the contrary, it would be ideal justice. What business have they to pray for his death, or pretend to his money? they are no relations. The most abominable thing about it is that they vary these prayers with every public attention; when he is ill, every one knows what they are after, and yet they vow offerings if he recovers; talk of versatility! So let <pb n="v.1.p.113"/> him be immortal, and bring them away before him with their mouths still open for the fruit that never drops. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>Well, they are rascals, and it would be a comic ending. He leads them a pretty life too, on hope gruel; he always looks more dead than alive, but he is tougher than a young man. They have divided up the inheritance among them, and feed on imaginary bliss.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Just so; now he is to throw off his years like Iolaus, and rejuvenate, while they in the middle of their hopes find themselves here with their dream-wealth left behind them. Nothing like making the punishment fit the crime.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker> 
<p>Say no more, Pluto; I will fetch you them one after another; seven of them, is it?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Down with them; and he shall change from an old man to a blooming youth, and attend their funerals. </p></sp></div>  <docAuthor>Henry Watson Fowler</docAuthor> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg066.perseus-eng4:6" n="1">  
<sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker> 
<p>Now is this fair, Pluto,—that I should die at the age of thirty, and that old Thucritus go on living past ninety?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Nothing could be fairer. Thucritus lives and is in no hurry for his neighbours to die; whereas you always had some design against him; you were waiting to step into his shoes.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker> 
<p>Well, an old man like that is past getting any enjoyment out of his money; he ought to die, and make room for younger men.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>This is a novel principle: the man who can no longer derive pleasure from his money is to die!—Fate and Nature have ordered it otherwise. </p></sp></div>  

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg066.perseus-eng4:6" n="2">  
<sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker> 
<p>Then they have ordered it wrongly. There ought to be a proper sequence according to seniority. Things are turned upside down, if an old man is to go on living with only three <pb n="v.1.p.114"/> teeth in his head, half blind, tottering about with a pair of slaves on each side to hold him up, drivelling and rheumy-eyed, having no joy of life, a living tomb, the derision of his juniors,— and young men are to die in the prime of their strength and beauty. ’Tis contrary to nature. At any rate the young men have a right to know when the old are going to die, so that they may not throw away their attentions on them for nothing, as is sometimes the case. The present arrangement is a putting of the cart before the horse.: </p></sp></div>  

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg066.perseus-eng4:6" n="3">  
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>There is a great deal more sound sense in it than you suppose, Terpsion. Besides, what right have you young fellows got to be prying after other men’s goods, and thrusting yourselves upon your childless elders? You look rather foolish, when you get buried first; it tickles people immensely; the more fervent your prayers for the death of your aged friend, the greater is the general exultation when you precede him. It has become quite a profession lately, this amorous devotion to old men and women,—childless, of course; children destroy the illusion. By the way though, some of the beloved objects see through your dirty motives well enough by now; they have children, but they pretend to hate them, and so have lovers all the same. When their wills come to be read, their faithful bodyguard is not included: nature asserts itself, the children get their rights, and the lovers realize, with gnashings of teeth, that they have been taken in. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker> 
<p>Too true! The luxuries that Thucritus has enjoyed at my expense! He always looked as if he were at the point of death. I never went to see him, but he would groan and squeak like a chicken barely out of the shell: I considered that he might step into his coffin at any moment, and heaped gift upon gift, for fear of being outdone in generosity by my rivals; I passed anxious, sleepless nights, reckoning and arranging all; ’twas this, the sleeplessness and the anxiety, that brought me <pb n="v.1.p.115"/> to my death. And he swallows my bait whole, and attends my funeral chuckling. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker> 
<p>Now I think of it, it would be a satisfaction if Charoeades were to die before him.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Pluto</speaker> 
<p>Charoeades! My dear Terpsion, Phido, Melanthus,— every one of them will be here before Thucritus,—all victims of this same anxiety!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Callidemides</speaker> 
<p>Yes, I was. Now there was an element of surprise about my fate. I suppose you know that old Ptoeodorus?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zenophantus</speaker> 
<p>The rich man with no children, to whom you gave most of your company?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Callidemides</speaker> 
<p>That is the man; he had promised to leave me his heir, and I used to show my appreciation. However, it went on such a time; Tithonus was a juvenile to him; so I found a short cut to my property. I bought a potion, and agreed with the butler that next time his master called for wine (he is a pretty stiff drinker) he should have this ready in a cup and present it; and I was pledged to reward the man with his freedom.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zenophantus</speaker>

<p>When we came from bath, the young fellow had two cups ready, one with the poison for Ptoeodorus, and the other for me; but by some blunder he handed me the poisoned cup, <pb n="v.1.p.116"/> and Ptoeodorus the plain; and behold, before he had done drinking, there was I sprawling on the ground, a vicarious corpse! Why are you laughing so, Zenophantus? I am your friend; such mirth is unseemly.</p></sp>

<p>So here you are at last, Polystratus; you must be something very like a centenarian.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>Ninety-eight.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>And what sort of a life have you had of it, these thirty years? you were about seventy when I died.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>Delightful, though you may find it hard to believe.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>It ¢s surprising that you could have any joy of your life— old, weak, and childless, moreover. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>In the first place, I could do just what I liked; there were still plenty of handsome boys and dainty women; perfumes were sweet, wine kept its bouquet, Sicilian feasts were nothing to mine,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>This is a change, to be sure; you were very economical in my day.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>Ah, but, my simple friend, these good things were presents—came in streams. From dawn my doors were thronged with visitors, and in the day it was a procession of the fairest gifts of earth.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>Why, you must have seized the crown after my death.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>Oh no, it was only that I inspired a number of tender passions,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>Tender passions, indeed! what, you, an old man with hardly a tooth left in your head!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>Certainly; the first of our townsmen were in love with me. Such as you see me, old, bald, blear-eyed, rheumy, they <pb n="v.1.p.118"/> delighted to do me honour; happy was the man on whom my glance rested a moment.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>Well, then, you had some adventure like Phaon’s, when he rowed Aphrodite across from Chios; your God granted your prayer and made you young and fair and lovely again.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>No, no; I was as you see me, and I was the object of all desire.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>I assure you, Simylus, I had a good deal of satisfaction out of my lovers; they idolized me, almost. Often I would be coy and shut some of them out. Such rivalries! such jealous emulations! </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>Who was the heir by this one? one of your relations, I suppose.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>About twenty.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker> 
<p>Ah, I can guess his office.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Polystratus</speaker> 
<p>Well, you know, he deserved the inheritance much better than they did; he was a barbarian and a rascal; but by this time he has the best of society at his beck. So he inherited; and now he is one of the aristocracy; his smooth chin and his <pb n="v.1.p.119"/> foreign accent are no bars to his being called nobler than Codrus, handsomer than Nireus, wiser than Odysseus.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Simylus</speaker>

When Ajax and Odysseus have wrestled for some time without either’s producing any impression, and the spectators are getting tired of it, the former proposes a change in tactics, '"Let us hoist—try you with me or I with you."

<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>What was the point of it?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Crato</speaker> 
<p>Why, the cousins were of equal age, expected to succeed to each other’s wealth, and behaved accordingly. They published their wills, each naming the other sole heir in case of his own prior decease. So it stood in black and white, and they vied with each other in showing that deference which the relation demands. Ali the prophets, astrologers, and Chaldean dream-interpreters alike, and Apollo himself for that matter, held different views at different times about the winner; the thousands seemed to incline now to Aristeas’s side, now to Moerichus’s. </p></sp></div>

<p>Cleverly done. Now, when we were alive, we never had such designs on one another. I never prayed for Antisthenes’s death, with a view to inheriting his staff—though it was an extremely serviceable one, which he had cut himself from a wild olive; and I do not credit you, Crates, with ever having had an eye to my succession; it included the tub, and a wallet with two pints of lupines in it.</p></sp>

<p>Others, however, were not interested in such property; no one paid us the attentions of an expectant heir; they all had their eyes on gold, instead.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Of course; they had no receptacle for such things as we could give; luxury had made them so leaky—as full of holes as a worn-out purse. Put wisdom, frankness, or truth into them, and it would have dropped out; the bottom of the bag would have let them through, like the perforated cask into which those poor Danaids are always pouring.

<p>It is a question of precedence. He says he is the better general: and I maintain that neither Hannibal nor (I might almost add) any of my predecessors was my equal in strategy; all the world knows that. </p></sp><pb n="v.1.p.126"/>

<p>Fortunately for me, Minos, I have mastered Greek since I have been here; so that my adversary will not have even that advantage of me. Now I hold that the highest praise is due to those who have won their way to greatness from obscurity; who have clothed themselves in power, and shown themselves fit for dominion. I myself entered Spain with a handful of men, took service under my brother, and was found worthy of the supreme command. I conquered the Celtiberians, subdued Western Gaul, crossed the Alps, overran the valley of the Po, sacked town after town, made myself master of the plains, approached the bulwarks of the capital, and in one day slew such a host, that their finger-rings were measured by bushels, and the rivers were bridged by their bodies. And this I did, though I had never been called a son of Ammon; I never pretended to be a god, never related visions of my mother; I made no secret of the fact that I was mere flesh and blood. My rivals were the ablest generals in the world, commanding the best soldiers in the world; I warred not with Medes or Assyrians, who fly before they are pursued, and yield the victory to him that dares take it. </p></sp></div>

<p>on the other hand, in increasing and extending as he did the dominion which he had inherited from his father, was but following the impetus given to him by Fortune. And this conqueror had no sooner crushed his puny adversary by the victories of Issus and Arbela, than he forsook the traditions of his country, and lived the life of a Persian; accepting the prostrations of his subjects, assassinating his friends at his own table, or handing them over to the executioner. I in my command respected the freedom of my country, delayed not to obey her summons, when the enemy with their huge armament invaded Libya, laid aside the privileges of my office, and <pb n="v.1.p.127"/> submitted to my sentence withouta murmur. Yet I wasa barbarian all unskilled in Greek culture; I could not recite Homer, nor had I enjoyed the advantages of Aristotle’s instruction; I had to make a shift with such qualities as were mine by nature.— It is on these grounds that I claim the pre-eminence. My rival has indeed all the lustre that attaches to the wearing of a diadem, and—I know not—for Macedonians such things may have charms: but I cannot think that this circumstance constitutes a higher claim than the courage and genius of one who owed nothing to Fortune, and everything to his own resolution.</p></sp>

<p>Silence, Minos, would be the best answer to such confident self-assertion. The tongue of Fame will suffice of itself to convince you that I was a great prince, and my opponent a petty adventurer. But I would have you consider the distance between us. Called to the throne while I was yet a boy, I quelled the disorders of my kingdom, and avenged my father’s murder. By the destruction of Thebes, I inspired the Greeks with such awe, that they appointed me their commander-inchief; and from that moment, scorning to confine myself to the kingdom that I inherited from my father, I extended my gaze over the entire face of the earth, and thought it shame if I should govern less than the whole. With a small force I invaded Asia, gained a great victory on the Granicus, took Lydia, Tonia, Phrygia,—in short, subdued all that was within my reach, before I commenced my march for Issus, where Darius was waiting for me at the head of his myriads. </p></sp></div>

<p>It is no use bending down; the water shrinks away as soon as it sees me coming. And if I do scoop it up and get it to my mouth, the outside of my lips is hardly moist before it has managed to run through my fingers, and my hand is as dry as ever.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>A very odd experience, that. But by the way, why do you want to drink? you have no body—the part of you that was liable to hunger and thirst is buried in Lydia somewhere; how can you, the spirit, hunger or thirst any more?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Tantalus</speaker> 
    <p>Therein lies my punishment—soul thirsts as if it were body.  </p></sp></div>  <pb n="v.1.p.137"/>

<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>Well, let that pass, as you say thirst is your punishment. But why do you mind it? are you afraid of dying, for want of drink? I do not know of any second Hades; can you die to this one, and go further?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Tantalus</speaker> 
<p>No, that is quite true. But you see this is part of the sentence: I must long for drink, though I have no need of it.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Menippus</speaker> 
<p>There is no meaning in that. There is a draught you need, though; some neat hellebore is what you want; you are suffering from a converse hydrophobia; you are not afraid of water, but you are of thirst.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Tantalus</speaker> 
<p>I would as lief drink hellebore as anything, if I could but drink.</p></sp>

<p>No, no, my dear sir; Paris surely is the man; he outraged all rights in carrying off his host’s wife with him. He deserves throttling, if you like, and not from you only, but from Greeks and barbarians as well, for all the deaths he brought upon them,</p></sp>

Finally, a vast tomb lies over me in Halicarnassus, of such dimensions, of such exquisite beauty as no other shade can boast. Thereon are the perfect semblances of man and horse, carved in the fairest marble; scarcely may a temple be found to match it. These are the grounds of my pride: are they inadequate? </p></sp></div>

Both are bald, and bare of flesh; our teeth are equally in evidence; each of us has lost his eyes, and each is snub-nosed. Then as to the tomb and the costly marbles, I dare say such a fine erection gives the Halicarnassians something to brag about and show off to strangers: but I don’t see, friend, that you are the better for it, unless it is that you claim to carry more weight than the rest of us, with all that marble on the top of you. </p></sp></div>

<p>We were a large party, of which the most distinguished were Ismenodorus, a rich townsman of ours, Arsaces, ruler of Media, and Oroetes the Armenian. Ismenodorus had been murdered by robbers going to Eleusis over Cithaeron, I believe. He was moaning, nursing his wound, apostrophizing the young children he had left, and cursing his foolhardiness. He knew Cithaeron and the Eleutherae district were all devastated by the wars, and yet he must take only two servants with him— with five bowls and four cups of solid gold in his baggage, too. </p></sp></div>

<p>Arsaces was an old man of rather imposing aspect; he expressed his feelings in true barbaric fashion, was exceedingly angry at being expected to walk, and kept calling for his horse. In point of factit had died with him, it and he having been simultaneously transfixed by a Thracian pikeman in the fight with the Cappadocians on the Araxes, Arsaces described to us how he had <pb n="v.1.p.150"/> charged far in advance of his men, and the Thracian, standing his ground and sheltering himself with his buckler, warded off the lance, and then, planting his pike, transfixed man and horse together. </p></sp></div>

<p>Oh, quite simple, The Median was charging with his thirty-foot lance in front of him; the Thracian knocked it aside with his buckler; the point glanced by; then he knelt, received the charge on his pike, pierced the horse’s chest—the spirited beast impaling itself by its own impetus—, and finally ran Arsaces through groin and buttock. You see what happened; it was the horse’s doing rather than the man’s. However, Arsaces did not at all appreciate equality, and wanted to come down on horseback. </p></sp></div>

<p>As for Oroetes, he was so tender-footed that he could not stand, far less walk. That is the way with all the Medes—once they are off their horses, they go delicately on tiptoe as if they were treading on thorns. He threw himself down, and there he lay; nothing would induce him to get up; so the excellent Hermes had to pick him up and carry him to the ferry; how I laughed! </p></sp></div>

I inquired into the manner of their deaths, though I knew very <pb n="v.1.p.151"/> well. When Damis exclaimed upon his son, ‘You only have your deserts,’ I remarked,—‘an old man of ninety living in luxury yourself with your million of money, and fobbing off your eighteen-year son with a few pence! As for you, sir Acarnanian’—he was groaning and cursing Myrtium—, ‘why put the blame on Love? it belongs to yourself; you were never afraid of an enemy—took all sorts of risks in other people’s service—and then let yourself be caught, my hero, by the artificial tears and sighs of the first wench you came across.’ Blepsias uttered his own condemnation, without giving me time to do it for him: he had hoarded his money for heirs who were nothing to him, and been fool enough to reckon on immortality.
