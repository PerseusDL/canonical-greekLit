<p><label>Diogenes</label> Pollux, I have a commission for you; next time you go up—and I think it is your turn for earth to-morrow—if you come across Menippus the Cynic—you will find him about the Craneum at Corinth, or in the Lyceum, laughing at the philosophers’ disputes—well, give him this message:—Menippus, Diogenes advises you, if mortal subjects for laughter begin to pall, to come down below, and find much richer material; where you are now, there is always a dash of uncertainty in it; the question will always intrude—who can be quite sure about the hereafter? Here, you can have your laugh out in security, like me; it is the best of sport to see millionaires, governors, despots, now mean and insignificant; you can only tell them by their lamentations, and the spiritless despondency which is the legacy of better days. Tell him this, and mention that he had better stuff his wallet with plenty of lupines, and any unconsidered trifles he can snap up in the way of pauper doles<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.107.n.1"> In the Greek, 'a Hecate’s repast lying at a street corner.' 'Rich men used to make offerings to Hecate on the 30th of every month as Goddess of roads at street corners; and these offerings were at once pounced upon by the poor, or, as here, the Cynics.' Jacobitz.</note> or lustral eggs<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.107.n.2">'Eggs were often used as purificatory offerings and set out in front of the house purified.’ Jacobitz.</note>.

and ventilation, and is patched all colours of the rainbow; always laughing, and usually gibing at pretentious philosophers,</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Ah, I cannot mistake him now.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> May I give you another message to those same philosophers?</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Oh, I don’t mind; go on.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Charge them generally to give up playing the fool, quarrelling over metaphysics, tricking each other with horn and crocodile puzzles,<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.108.n.1">See Puzzles in Notes.</note> and teaching people to waste wit on such absurdities.</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Oh, but if I say anything against their wisdom, they will call me an ignorant blockhead.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Then tell them from me to go to the devil.</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Very well; rely upon me.

<p></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> And then, my most obliging of Polluxes, there is this for the rich:—O vain fools, why hoard gold? why all these pains over interest sums and the adding of hundred to hundred, when you must shortly come to us with nothing beyond the dead-penny?</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> They shall have their message too.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Ah, and a word to the handsome and strong; Megillus of Corinth, and Damoxenus the wrestler will do. Inform them that auburn locks, eyes bright or black, rosy cheeks, are as little in fashion here as tense muscles or mighty shoulders; man and man are as like as two peas, tell them, when it comes to bare skull and no beauty.</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> That is to the handsome and strong; yes, I can manage that.

another, and they will find those who were rich on earth no better than themselves. As for your Spartans, -you will not mind scolding them, from me, upon their present degeneracy?</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> No, no, Diogenes; leave Sparta alone; that is going too far; your other commissions I will execute.</p>

<head>Before <label>Pluto</label>: <label>Croesus</label>, <label>Midas</label>, and <label>Sardanapalus</label> against <label>Menippus</label></head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg066.perseus-eng4:2" n="1">
<p><label>Croesus</label> Pluto, we can stand this snarling Cynic no longer in our neighbourhood; either you must transfer him to other quarters, or we are going to migrate,</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> Why, what harm does he do to your ghostly community?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Midas here, and Sardanapalus and I, can never get in a good cry over the old days of gold and luxury and treasure, but he must be laughing at us, and calling us rude names;
‘slaves’ and ‘garbage,’ he says we are. And then he sings; and that throws us out.—In short, he is a nuisance,</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> Menippus, what’s this I hear?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> All perfectly true, Pluto. I detest these abject rascals!
Not content with having lived the abominable lives they did, they keep on talking about it now they are dead, and harping on the good old days. I take a positive pleasure in annoying them,</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> Yes, but you mustn’t. They have had terrible losses; they feel it deeply.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Pluto! you are not going to lend your countenance to these whimpering fools?</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> It isn’t that; but I won’t have you quarrelling.

<p><label>Menippus</label> Well, you scum of your respective nations, let there be no misunderstanding: I am going on just the same. Wherever

you are, there shall I be also; worrying, jeering, singing you down.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Presumption!</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Not a bit of it. Yours was the presumption, when you expected men to fall down before you, when you trampled on men’s liberty, and forgot there was such a thing as death. Now comes the weeping and gnashing of teeth: for all is lost!</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Lost! Ah God! My treasure-heapp——</p>

<p><label>Midas</label> My gold——</p>

<p><label>Sardanapalus</label> My little comforts——</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> That’s right: stick to it! You do the whining, and I'll chime in with a string of cnotHi-saurons, best of accompaniments, F.

<p></p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Now I wonder how it is that you two dead men have been honoured with temples and taken for prophets; those silly mortals imagine you are Gods.</p>

<p><label>Ampbilochus</label> How can we help it, if they are fools enough to have such fancies about the dead?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Ah, they would never have had them, though, if you had not been charlatans in your lifetime, and pretended to know the future and be able to foretell it to your clients.</p>

<p><label>Trophonius</label> Well, Menippus, Amphilochus can take his own line, if he likes; as for me, I am a Hero, and do give oracles to any one who comes down to me. It is pretty clear you were never at Lebadea, or you would not be so incredulous.

<p><label>Menippus</label> What do you mean? I must go to Lebadea, swaddle myself up in absurd linen, take a cake in my hand, and crawl through a narrow passage into a cave, before I could tell that you are a dead man, with nothing but knavery to differentiate



<pb n="v.1.p.111"/>


you from the rest of us? Now, on your seer-ship, what is a Hero? I am sure I don’t know.</p>

<p><label>Trophonius</label> He is half God, and half man,</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> So what is neither man (as you imply) nor God, is both at once? Well, at present what has become of your diviner half?</p>

<p><label>Trophonius</label> He gives oracles in Boeotia.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> What you may mean is quite beyond me; the one thing I know for certain is that you are dead—the whole of you.

<p></p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Ferryman, what do you say to settling up accounts?
It will prevent any unpleasantness later on.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Very good. It does save trouble to get these things straight.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> One anchor, to your order, five shillings.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> That is a lot of money.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> So help me Pluto, it is what I had to pay. One rowlock-strap, fourpence,</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Five and four; put that down.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Then there was a needle, for mending the sail; tenpence.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Down with it.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Caulking-wax; nails; and cord for the brace. Two shillings the lot.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> They were worth the money.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> That’s all; unless I have forgotten anything. When will you pay it?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> I can’t just now, Hermes; we shall have a war or a plague presently, and then the passengers will come shoaling in, and I shall be able to make a little by jobbing the fares.

<p><label>Hermes</label> So for the present I have nothing to do but sit down, and pray for the worst, as my only chance of getting paid?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> There is nothing else for it;—very little business doing just now, as you see, owing to the peace.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> That is just as well, though it does keep me waiting for my money. After all, though, Charon, in old days men were men; you remember the state they used to come down in,—all blood and wounds generally. Nowadays, a man is poisoned by his slave or his wife; or gets dropsy from overfeeding; a pale, spiritless lot, nothing like-the men of old. Most of them seem to meet their end in some plot that has money for its object.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Ah; money is in great request.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes—lives at Sicyon. Well?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> It would seem so strange, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> On the contrary, it would be ideal justice. What business have they to pray for his death, or pretend to his money? they are no relations. The most abominable thing about it is that they vary these prayers with every public attention; when he is ill, every one knows what they are after, and yet they vow offerings if he recovers; talk of versatility!

<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, they are rascals, and it would be a comic ending. He leads them a pretty life too, on hope gruel; he always looks more dead than alive, but he is tougher than a young man. They have divided up the inheritance among them, and feed on imaginary bliss.</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> Just so; now he is to throw off his years like Iolaus, and rejuvenate, while they in the middle of their hopes find themselves here with their dream-wealth left behind them. Nothing like making the punishment fit the crime.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Say no more, Pluto; I will fetch you them one after another; seven of them, is it?</p>

<p></p>

<p><label>Terpsion</label> Now is this fair, Pluto,—that I should die at the age of thirty, and that old Thucritus go on living past ninety?</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> Nothing could be fairer. Thucritus lives and is in no hurry for his neighbours to die; whereas you always had some design against him; you were waiting to step into his shoes.</p>

<p><label>Terpsion</label> Well, an old man like that is past getting any enjoyment out of his money; he ought to die, and make room for younger men.</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> This is a novel principle: the man who can no longer derive pleasure from his money is to die!—Fate and Nature have ordered it otherwise.

teeth in his head, half blind, tottering about with a pair of slaves on each side to hold him up, drivelling and rheumy-eyed, having no joy of life, a living tomb, the derision of his juniors,— and young men are to die in the prime of their strength and beauty. ’Tis contrary to nature. At any rate the young men have a right to know when the old are going to die, so that they may not throw away their attentions on them for nothing, as is sometimes the case. The present arrangement is a putting of the cart before the horse.:

<p><label>Pluto</label> There is a great deal more sound sense in it than you suppose, Terpsion. Besides, what right have you young fellows got to be prying after other men’s goods, and thrusting yourselves upon your childless elders? You look rather foolish, when you get buried first; it tickles people immensely; the more fervent your prayers for the death of your aged friend, the greater is the general exultation when you precede him. It has become quite a profession lately, this amorous devotion to old men and women,—childless, of course; children destroy the illusion. By the way though, some of the beloved objects see through your dirty motives well enough by now; they have children, but they pretend to hate them, and so have lovers all the same. When their wills come to be read, their faithful bodyguard is not included: nature asserts itself, the children get their rights, and the lovers realize, with gnashings of teeth, that they have been taken in.

<p><label>Terpsion</label> Too true! The luxuries that Thucritus has enjoyed at my expense! He always looked as if he were at the point of death. I never went to see him, but he would groan and squeak like a chicken barely out of the shell: I considered that he might step into his coffin at any moment, and heaped gift upon gift, for fear of being outdone in generosity by my rivals;
I passed anxious, sleepless nights, reckoning and arranging all;
’twas this, the sleeplessness and the anxiety, that brought me

<p><label>Callidemides</label> Yes, I was. Now there was an element of surprise about my fate. I suppose you know that old Ptoeodorus?</p>

<p><label>Zenophantus</label> The rich man with no children, to whom you gave most of your company?</p>

<p><label>Callidemides</label> That is the man; he had promised to leave me his heir, and I used to show my appreciation. However, it went on such a time; Tithonus was a juvenile to him; so I found a short cut to my property. I bought a potion, and agreed with the butler that next time his master called for wine (he is a pretty stiff drinker) he should have this ready in a cup and present it; and I was pledged to reward the man with his freedom.</p>

<p><label>Zenophantus</label> Well, it was such a humorous exit. And how did the old man behave?</p>

<p><label>Callidemides</label> He was dreadfully distressed for the moment; then he saw, I suppose, and laughed as much as you over the butler’s trick,</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> So here you are at last, Polystratus; you must be something very like a centenarian.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Ninety-eight.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> And what sort of a life have you had of it, these thirty years? you were about seventy when I died.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Delightful, though you may find it hard to believe.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> It ¢s surprising that you could have any joy of your life— old, weak, and childless, moreover.

<p><label>Polystratus</label> In the first place, I could do just what I liked; there were still plenty of handsome boys and dainty women; perfumes were sweet, wine kept its bouquet, Sicilian feasts were nothing to mine,</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> This is a change, to be sure; you were very economical in my day.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Ah, but, my simple friend, these good things were presents—came in streams. From dawn my doors were thronged with visitors, and in the day it was a procession of the fairest gifts of earth.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Why, you must have seized the crown after my death.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Oh no, it was only that I inspired a number of tender passions,</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Tender passions, indeed! what, you, an old man with hardly a tooth left in your head!</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Certainly; the first of our townsmen were in love with me. Such as you see me, old, bald, blear-eyed, rheumy, they

delighted to do me honour; happy was the man on whom my glance rested a moment.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Well, then, you had some adventure like Phaon’s, when he rowed Aphrodite across from Chios; your God granted your prayer and made you young and fair and lovely again.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> No, no; I was as you see me, and I was the object of all desire.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Oh, I give it up.

<p><label>Simylus</label> Ah, now I comprehend your beauty, old fellow; it was the Golden Aphrodite bestowed it.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> I assure you, Simylus, I had a good deal of satisfaction out of my lovers; they idolized me, almost. Often I would be coy and shut some of them out. Such rivalries! such jealous emulations!

<p><label>Simylus</label> And how did you dispose of your fortune in the end?</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> I gave each an express promise to make him my heir; he believed, and treated me to more attentions than ever; meanwhile I had another genuine will, which was the one I left, with a message to them all to go hang.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Who was the heir by this one? one of your relations, I suppose.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Not likely; it was a handsome young Phrygian I had lately bought.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Age?</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> About twenty.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Ah, I can guess his office.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Well, you know, he deserved the inheritance much better than they did; he was a barbarian and a rascal; but by this time he has the best of society at his beck. So he inherited; and now he is one of the aristocracy; his smooth chin and his

<p><label>Crato</label> Did you know Moerichus of Corinth, Diogenes? A shipowner, rolling in money, with a cousin called Aristeas, nearly as rich. He had a Homeric quotation Wilt thou heave me? shall I heave thee?<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.123.n.1">Homer, Il. xxiii. 724. When Ajax and Odysseus have wrestled for some time without either’s producing any impression, and the spectators are getting tired of it, the former proposes a change in tactics, '"Let us hoist—try you with me or I with you." The idea evidently is that each in turn is to offer only a passive resistance, and let his adversary try to fling him thus.’ Leaf.</note>






<pb n="v.1.p.124"/></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> What was the point of it?</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Why, the cousins were of equal age, expected to succeed to each other’s wealth, and behaved accordingly. They published their wills, each naming the other sole heir in case of his own prior decease. So it stood in black and white, and they vied with each other in showing that deference which the relation demands. Ali the prophets, astrologers, and Chaldean dream-interpreters alike, and Apollo himself for that matter, held different views at different times about the winner; the thousands seemed to incline now to Aristeas’s side, now to Moerichus’s.

<p><label>Diogenes</label> And how did it end? I am quite curious.</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> They both died on the same day, and the properties passed to Eunomius and Thrasycles, two relations who had never had a presentiment of it. They had been crossing from Sicyon to Cirrha, when they were taken aback by a squall from the north-west, and capsized in mid-channel.

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Cleverly done. Now, when we were alive, we never had such designs on one another. I never prayed for Antisthenes’s death, with a view to inheriting his staff—though it was an extremely serviceable one, which he had cut himself from a wild olive; and I do not credit you, Crates, with ever having had an eye to my succession; it included the tub, and a wallet with two pints of lupines in it.</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Why, no; these things were superfluities to me—and to yourself, indeed. The real necessities you inherited from Antisthenes, and I from you; and in those necessities was more grandeur and majesty than in the Persian Empire.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> You allude to—.</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Wisdom, independence, truth, frankness, freedom.




<pb n="v.1.p.125"/></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> To be sure; now I think of it, I did inherit all this from Antisthenes, and left it to you with some addition.

<p><label>Crato</label> Others, however, were not interested in such property; no one paid us the attentions of an expectant heir; they all had their eyes on gold, instead.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Of course; they had no receptacle for such things as we could give; luxury had made them so leaky—as full of holes as a worn-out purse. Put wisdom, frankness, or truth into them, and it would have dropped out; the bottom of the bag would have let them through, like the perforated cask into which those poor Danaids are always pouring. Gold, on the other hand, they could grip with tooth or nail or somehow.</p>

<p><label>Hannibal</label> Fortunately for me, Minos, I have mastered Greek since I have been here; so that my adversary will not have even that advantage of me. Now I hold that the highest praise is due to those who have won their way to greatness from obscurity; who have clothed themselves in power, and shown themselves fit for dominion. I myself entered Spain with a handful of men, took service under my brother, and was found worthy of the supreme command. I conquered the Celtiberians, subdued Western Gaul, crossed the Alps, overran the valley of the Po, sacked town after town, made myself master of the plains, approached the bulwarks of the capital, and in one day slew such a host, that their finger-rings were measured by bushels, and the rivers were bridged by their bodies. And this I did, though I had never been called a son of Ammon; I never pretended to be a god, never related visions of my mother; I made no secret of the fact that I was mere flesh and blood. My rivals were the ablest generals in the world, commanding the best soldiers in the world; I warred not with Medes or Assyrians, who fly before they are pursued, and yield the victory to him that dares take it.

And this conqueror had no sooner crushed his puny adversary by the victories of Issus and Arbela, than he forsook the traditions of his country, and lived the life of a Persian; accepting the prostrations of his subjects, assassinating his friends at his own table, or handing them over to the executioner. I in my command respected the freedom of my country, delayed not to obey her summons, when the enemy with their huge armament invaded Libya, laid aside the privileges of my office, and

It is on these grounds that I claim the pre-eminence. My rival has indeed all the lustre that attaches to the wearing of a diadem, and—I know not—for Macedonians such things may have charms: but I cannot think that this circumstance constitutes a higher claim than the courage and genius of one who owed nothing to Fortune, and everything to his own resolution.</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Silence, Minos, would be the best answer to such confident self-assertion. The tongue of Fame will suffice of itself to convince you that I was a great prince, and my opponent a petty adventurer. But I would have you consider the distance between us. Called to the throne while I was yet a boy, I quelled the disorders of my kingdom, and avenged my father’s murder. By the destruction of Thebes, I inspired the Greeks with such awe, that they appointed me their commander-inchief; and from that moment, scorning to confine myself to the kingdom that I inherited from my father, I extended my gaze over the entire face of the earth, and thought it shame if I should govern less than the whole. With a small force I invaded Asia, gained a great victory on the Granicus, took Lydia, Tonia, Phrygia,—in short, subdued all that was within my reach, before I commenced my march for Issus, where Darius was waiting for me at the head of his myriads.

<p><label>Scipio</label> That Alexander is my superior, and I am Hannibal’s, having defeated him, and driven him to ignominious flight. What impudence is this, to contend with Alexander, to whom I, your conqueror, would not presume to compare myself!</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Honestly spoken, Scipio, on my word! Very well, then:
Alexander comes first, and you next; and I think we must say Hannibal third. And a very creditable third, too. F.

<p><label>Alexander</label> As you see, sir; is there anything extraordinary in a mortal’s dying?</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> So Ammon lied when he said you were his son; you were Philip’s after all.</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Apparently; if I had been Ammon’s, I should not have died.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Strange! there were tales of the same order about Olympias too. A serpent visited her, and was seen in her bed; we were given to understand that that was how you came into the world, and Philip made a mistake when he took you for his.</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Yes, I was told all that myself; however, I know now that my mother’s and the Ammon stories were all moonshine.</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Diogenes, I cannot tell you. I had no time to leave any directions about it, beyond just giving Perdiccas my ring as I died, Why are you laughing?</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Oh, I was only thinking of the Greeks’ behaviour; directly you succeeded, how they flattered you! their elected patron, generalissimo against the barbarian; one of the twelve Gods according to some; temples built and sacrifices offered to the Serpent’s son!

<p><label>Philip</label> What, to suffer yourself to be fooled by lying priests?</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> No, but it had an awe-inspiring effect upon the barbarians. When they thought they had a God to deal with, they gave up the struggle; which made their conquest a simple matter.

It was other work conquering the Greeks: Boeotians, Phocians, Athenians; Arcadian hoplites, Thessalian cavalry, javelin-men from Elis, peltasts of Mantinea; Thracians, Illyrians, Paeonians; to subdue these was something. But for gold-laced womanish Medes and Persians and Chaldaeans,—why, it had been done before: did you never hear of the expedition of the Ten Thousand under Clearchus? and how the enemy would not even come to blows with them, but ran away before they were within bow-shot?

<p><label>Philip</label> Not a word. Not that it is a bad thing, in my opinion, for a king to get wounded occasionally, and to face danger at the head of his troops: but this was the last thing that you were called upon to do. You were passing for a God; and your being wounded, and carried off the field on a litter, bleeding and, groaning, could only excite the ridicule of the spectators:
Ammon stood convicted of quackery, his oracle of falsehood, his priests of flattery. The son of Zeus in a swoon, requiring medical assistance! who could help laughing at the sight?
And now that you have died, can you doubt that many a jest is being cracked on the subject of your divinity, as men contemplate the God’s corpse laid out for burial, and already going the way of all flesh?

Such sentiments might have been very well in the mouth of a poor-spirited cowardly Phrygian, dishonourably in love with life: for the son of Peleus, boldest of all Heroes, so to vilify himself, is a disgrace; it gives the lie to all your life; you might have had a long inglorious reign in Phthia, and your own choice was death and glory.

<p><label>Aeacus</label> That is Cyrus; and here is Croesus; beyond him Sardanapalus, and beyond him again Midas, And yonder is Xerxes.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Ha! and it was before this creature that Greece trembled? this is our yoker of Hellesponts, our designer of Athoscanals?—Croesus too! a sad spectacle! As to Sardanapalus, I will lend him a box on the ear, with your permission.</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> And crack his skull, poor dear! Certainly not.</p>

Further, I was comely, and of noble stature, and a mighty warrior. Finally, a vast tomb lies over me in Halicarnassus, of such dimensions, of such exquisite beauty as no other shade can boast. Thereon are the perfect semblances of man and horse, carved in the fairest marble; scarcely may a temple be found to match it. These are the grounds of my pride: are they inadequate?

If we were to appoint an umpire now on the question of comeliness, I see no reason why he should prefer your skull to mine. Both are bald, and bare of flesh; our teeth are equally in evidence; each of us has lost his eyes, and each is snub-nosed. Then as to the tomb and the costly marbles, I dare say such a fine erection gives the Halicarnassians something to brag about and show off to strangers: but I don’t see, friend, that you are the better for it, unless it is that you claim to carry more weight than the rest of us, with all that marble on the top of you.

While Mausolus boasts of the tomb raised to him by Artemisia, his wife and sister, Diogenes knows not whether he has a tomb or no—the question never having occurred to him; he knows only that his name is on the tongues of the wise, as one who lived the life of a man; a higher monument than yours, vile Carian slave, and set on firmer foundations, F.

Ismenodorus had been murdered by robbers going to Eleusis over Cithaeron, I believe. He was moaning, nursing his wound, apostrophizing the young children he had left, and cursing his foolhardiness. He knew Cithaeron and the Eleutherae district were all devastated by the wars, and yet he must take only two servants with him— with five bowls and four cups of solid gold in his baggage, too.

<p><label>Crato</label> Oh, quite simple, The Median was charging with his thirty-foot lance in front of him; the Thracian knocked it aside with his buckler; the point glanced by; then he knelt, received the charge on his pike, pierced the horse’s chest—the spirited beast impaling itself by its own impetus—, and finally ran Arsaces through groin and buttock. You see what happened; it was the horse’s doing rather than the man’s. However, Arsaces did not at all appreciate equality, and wanted to come down on horseback.

When Damis exclaimed upon his son, ‘You only have your deserts,’ I remarked,—‘an old man of ninety living in luxury yourself with your million of money, and fobbing off your eighteen-year son with a few pence! As for you, sir Acarnanian’—he was groaning and cursing Myrtium—, ‘why put the blame on Love? it belongs to yourself; you were never afraid of an enemy—took all sorts of risks in other people’s service—and then let yourself be caught, my hero, by the artificial tears and sighs of the first wench you came across.’ Blepsias uttered his own condemnation, without giving me time to do it for him: he had hoarded his money for heirs who were nothing to him, and been fool enough to reckon on immortality. I assure you it was no common satisfaction I derived from their whinings.

But here we are at the gate; we must keep our eyes open, and get the earliest view. Lord, lord, what a mixed crowd! and all in tears except these babes and sucklings. Why, the hoary seniors are all lamentation too; strange! has madam Life given them a love-potion?

<p>I must interrogate this most reverend senior of them all.—Sir, why weep, seeing that you have died full of years? has your excellency any complaint to make, after so long a term? Ah, but you were doubtless a king.</p>

<p><label>Pauper</label> Not so.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> A provincial governor, then?</p>

<p><label>Pauper</label> No, nor that.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> I see; you were wealthy, and do not like leaving your boundless luxury to die.</p>

<p><label>Pauper</label> You are quite mistaken; I was near ninety, made a miserable livelihood out of my line and rod, was excessively poor, childless, a cripple, and had nearly lost my sight.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> And you still wished to live?</p>

<p><label>Pauper</label> Ay, sweet is the light, and dread is death; would that one might escape it!



<pb n="v.1.p.152"/></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> You are beside yourself, old man; you are like a child kicking at the pricks, you contemporary of the ferryman. Well, we need wonder no more at youth, when age is still in love with life; one would have thought it should court death as the cure for its proper ills. —And now let us go our way, before our loitering here brings suspicion on us; they may think we are planning an escape.

<p><label>Menippus</label> Whether you are blind or not, Tiresias, would be a difficult question. Eyeless sockets are the rule among us; there is no telling Phineus from Lynceus nowadays. However, I know that you were a seer, and that you enjoy the unique distinction of having been both man and woman; I have it from the poets. Pray tell me which you found the more pleasant life, the man’s or the woman’s?</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> The woman’s, by a long way; it was much less trouble. Women have the mastery of men; and there is no fighting for them, no manning of walls, no squabbling in the assembly, no eross-examination in the law-courts.

<p></p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Well, but you have heard how Medea, in Euripides, compassionates her sex on their hard lot—on the intolerable pangs they endure in travail? And by the way—Medea’s words remind me—did you ever have a child, when you were a woman, or were you barren?</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> What do you mean by that question, Menippus?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Oh, nothing; but I should like to know, if it is no trouble to you.</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> I was not barren: but I did not have a child, exactly.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> No; but you might have had. That’s all I wanted to know.



<pb n="v.1.p.153"/></p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> Certainly.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> And your feminine characteristics gradually vanished, and you developed a beard, and became a man? Or did the change take place in a moment?</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> Whither does your question tend? One would think you doubted the fact.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> And what should I do but doubt such a story? AmI to take it in, like a nincompoop, without asking myself whether it is possible or not?

<p></p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> At that rate, I suppose you are equally incredulous when you hear of women being turned into birds or trees or beasts,— Aëdon for instance, or Daphne, or Callisto?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> If I fall in with any of these ladies, I will see what they have to say about it. But to return, friend, to your own case: were you a prophet even in the days of your femininity? or did manhood and prophecy come together?</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> Pooh, you know nothing of the matter. I once settled a dispute among the Gods, and was blinded by Hera for my pains; whereupon Zeus consoled me with the gift of prophecy.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Ah, you love a lie still, Tiresias. But there, ’tis your trade. You prophets! There is no truth in you. F.

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> If you went mad and wrought your own destruction, Ajax, in default of that you designed for us all, why put the blame on Odysseus? Why would you not vouchsafe him a look or a word, when he came to consult Tiresias that day? you stalked past your old comrade in arms as if he was beneath your notice.</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> Had I not good reason? My madness lies at the door of my solitary rival for the arms.



<pb n="v.1.p.154"/></p>

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> Did you expect to be unopposed, and carry it over us all without a contest?</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> Surely, in such a matter. The armour was mine by natural right, seeing I was Achilles’s cousin. The rest of you, his undoubted superiors, refused to compete, recognizing my claim. It was the son of Laertes, he that I had rescued scores of times when he would have been cut to pieces by the Phrygians, who set up for a better man and a stronger claimant than I.

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> Blame Thetis, then, my good sir; it was she who, instead of delivering the inheritance to the next of kin, brought the arms and left the ownership an open question.</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> No, no; the guilt was in claiming them—alone, I mean.</p>

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> Surely, Ajax, a mere man may be forgiven the sin of coveting honour—that sweetest bait for which each one of us adventured; nay, and he outdid you there, if a Trojan verdict counts.</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> Who inspired that verdict<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.1.p.154.n.1">Athene is meant. The allusion is to Homer, Od. xi. 547, a passage upon the contest for the arms of Achilles, in which Odysseus states that ‘The judges were the sons of the Trojans, and Pallas Athene.’</note>? I know, but about the Gods we may not speak. Let that pass; but cease to hate Odysseus? ’tis not in my power, Agamemnon, though Athene’s self should require it of me. H.

<p><label>Minos</label> Sostratus, the pirate here, can be dropped into Pyriphlegethon, Hermes; the temple-robber shall be clawed by the Chimera; and lay out the tyrant alongside of Tityus, there to have his liver torn by the vultures. And you honest fellows can make the best of your way to Elysium and the Isles of the Blest; this it is to lead righteous lives.




<pb n="v.1.p.155"/></p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> A word with you, Minos. See if there is not some justice in my plea.</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> What, more pleadings? Have you not been convicted of villany and murder without end?</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> I have. Yet consider whether my sentence is just.</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Is it just that you should have your deserts? If so, the sentence is just.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Well, answer my questions; I will not detain you long.</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Say on, but be brief; I have other cases waiting for me.

<p></p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> The deeds of my life—were they in my own choice, or were they decreed by Fate?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Decreed, of course.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Then all of us, whether we passed for honest men or rogues, were the instruments of Fate in all that we did?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Certainly; Clotho prescribes the conduct of every man at his birth.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Now suppose a man commits a murder under compulsion of a power which he cannot resist, an executioner, for instance, at the bidding of a judge, or a bodyguard at that of a tyrant. Who is the murderer, according to you?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> The judge, of course, or the tyrant. As well ask whether the sword is guilty, which is but the tool of his anger who is prime mover in the affair.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> I am indebted to you for a further illustration of my argument. Again: a slave, sent by his master, brings me gold or silver; to whom am I to be grateful? who goes down on my tablets as a benefactor?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> The sender; the bringer is but his minister.

<p></p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Observe then your injustice! You punish us who are but the slaves of Clotho’s bidding, and reward these, who do but minister to another’s beneficence. For it will never be said that it was in our power to gainsay the irresistible ordinances of Fate?



<pb n="v.1.p.156"/></p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Ah, Sostratus; look closely enough, and you will find plenty of inconsistencies besides these. However, I see you are no common pirate, but a philosopher in your way; so much you have gained by your questions. Let him go, Hermes; he shall not be punished after that. But mind, Sostratus, you must not put it into other people’s heads to ask questions of this kind. F.</p></div>
