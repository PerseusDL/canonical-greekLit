<sp><speaker>GLYCERA</speaker><p>Thais, do you know the Acarnanian soldier, who
in the old days kept Abrotonum, and afterwards fell
in love with me—the dandy, I mean, with the fine
military cloak—or have you forgotten the fellow?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THAIS</speaker><p>No, Glycera, dearie, I know him. He drank with
us last year at the harvest celebrations. But what
of it? You looked as though you had something to
tell me about him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GLYCERA</speaker><p>That nasty thing Gorgona, who pretends to be my
friend, has got her claws into him and stolen him
from me behind my back.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THAIS</speaker><p>So now he won’t be visiting you any more, but
has taken Gorgona to be his mistress.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GLYCERA</speaker><p>Yes, Thais, and it’s hurt me very much.</p></sp>


<pb n="v.7.p.359"/>
<sp><speaker>THAIS</speaker><p>It was a dirty trick, dearie, but only to be expected;
it’s a common practice of us girls. So you
mustn’t take it too hard or blame Gorgona; for,
earlier on, Abrotonum didn’t blame you over him;
and yet you’d been friends. </p></sp>

<sp><p>But I do wonder what
this soldier man found in her, unless he’s absolutely
blind and hadn’t noticed that her hair is thin on top
and receding a long way in front; her lips are
livid and her neck’s scraggy with the veins all
standing out, and what a long nose she’s got! Her
only good point is that she’s tall and has a good
carriage and a very attractive smile.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GLYCERA</speaker><p>Why, Thais, you don’t think the Acarnanian has
fallen for her beauty? Don’t you know that her
mother, Chrysarium, is a witch who knows Thessalian
spells, and can bring the moon down? Why,
they say she even flies of a night. She’s the one
who’s sent the fellow out of his senses by giving him
a drink of her brew, and now they’re making a fine
harvest out of him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THAIS</speaker><p>You’ll have your harvest too, dearie; you’ll find
someone else; let him go to the devil.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MYRTIUM</speaker><p>So, Pamphilus, you’re planning to marry the
daughter of Philo, the shipowner. I’ve even heard


<pb n="v.7.p.361"/>


you’re already married. Have all your sworn oaths
and tears gone in a moment, have you forgotten your
Myrtium, and at a time like this, when I’m eight
months gone? All the good I’ve had from your
love is that you’ve given me such an enormous
belly, and I’ll soon have to bring up a child, and
that’s a terrible nuisance for a lady of my kind.
For I’m not going to expose the child, particularly
if it’s a boy, but I’ll call him Pamphilus, and keep
him to console me for my unhappy love, and one
day he’ll tell you off for your treachery to his poor
mother. I don’t think much of your bride’s looks.
I saw her the other day with her mother at the
Thesmophoria, though I didn’t know at the time
that I’d never see Pamphilus again because of her.
I think you’d better have a good look at her too,
before it’s too late, and examine her face and her
eyes; I wouldn’t like you to be vexed at the marked
steel-grey colour of her eyes, or disappointed because
they squint inwards. Better still you’ve seen your
father-in-law, Philo, and know what his face is like.
You won’t need to see the daughter after seeing him!</p></sp>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:2" n="2">
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p>How long shall I have to listen to your nonsense
about young ladies and your stories of matches
with shipowning families? Do I know any bride
whether snub-nosed or pretty? Or that Philo of
Alopece—I presume you mean him—so much as
had a daughter of marriageable age? Anyway, he’s
not even on good terms with my father. I remember
he was sued by him only the other day for debt.
He owed my father a talent, I believe, but refused to


<pb n="v.7.p.363"/>


pay, and my father had him before the Admiralty
Court, and had the greatest difficulty in squeezing it
out of him, and didn’t get it all, he kept saying.
Even if I had decided to marry, do you think I’d
have passed over the daughter of Demeas, who was
a General last year, particularly as she was a cousin
on my mother’s side, and be marrying Philo’s
daughter instead? Wherever did you hear this
story? What empty jealous ideas have you
invented for yourself, Myrtium, that you lash out
so blindly?</p></sp>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:2" n="3">
<sp><speaker>MYRTIUM</speaker><p>Then you’re not getting married, Pamphilus?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p>Are you out of your mind, Myrtium, or is it a
hang-over? Though I must say we remained quite
sober last night.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MYRTIUM</speaker><p>It was Doris here who gave me this nasty shock.
I sent her out to buy some wool for the little
stranger, and to pray to Artemis to deliver me safely,
and she’d met Lesbia, she told me, and—but it’d be
better for you yourself, Doris, to tell him what you
heard, unless you made all this up.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DORIS</speaker><p>Ruin take me, mistress, if I told a single lie.
When I got to the town-hall, I met Lesbia who was
all smiles and told me that our lover, Pamphilus,
was marrying Philo’s daughter. She said that if
I didn’t believe her, I was to peep into your alley and
see the garlands everywhere, the girl-pipers, the
commotion, and the people singing the wedding hymn.</p></sp>


<pb n="v.7.p.365"/>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p>Well, Doris, did you take a peep?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DORIS</speaker><p>I certainly did, and I saw everything, just as she
said.</p></sp>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:2" n="4">
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p>I understand how you were misled. It wasn’t all
lies that Lesbia told you, Doris. What you reported
to Myrtium was true. But you were worried
without reason, for the wedding wasn’t in our house,
but now I recall my mother’s words, when I returned
from here yesterday. “My dear Pamphilus”, she
said, “Charmides, that young fellow of the same
age as you, the son of neighbour Aristaenetus, is
getting married at last. He’s showing some sense,
but how long are you going to continue keeping a mistress
?”Listening to her on and off, I dropped off to
sleep. Then I left the house early in the morning, so
that I didn’t see anything of what Doris saw later on.
If you don’t believe me, Doris, go out again and take a
good look, not just at the lane, but at the door to
see which one has the garlands. You’ll find it
belongs to our neighbours’ house.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MYRTIUM</speaker><p>You’ve saved my life, Pamphilus. I’d have
hanged myself, if anything like that had happened.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p>Such a thing could never have happened. I hope
I’ll never be so mad as to forget Myrtium, especially
now that she’s going to have my child.</p></sp>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:3" n="1">

<sp><speaker>MOTHER</speaker><p>Did you take leave of your senses at the party
last night, Philinna? What came over you?
Diphilus came to me early this morning in tears, and
told me how you’d treated him. He said you were
drunk, got up and danced in the middle of the
company, though he tried to stop you, then kissed
his friend, Lamprias, and, when he showed that
he was annoyed with you, left him, went over to
Lamprias, and threw your arms round his neck.
He choked with rage, he said, at such goings on.
But even later on, I imagine, you wouldn’t sleep
with him, but left him weeping, and lay down by
yourself on the nearby pallet, singing songs, and
annoying him.</p></sp>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:3" n="2">
<sp><speaker>PHILINNA</speaker><p>Of course, he didn’t tell you what he did, mother,
or you wouldn’t take the part of one who behaved
so outrageously. He left me and prattled with
Thais, Lamprias’ girl, for Lamprias himself had not
yet arrived. After he had seen that I was angry,
and I’d shown him how I disapproved of his behaviour,
he laid hold of the tip of Thais’ ear, bent
her neck, and kissed her so hard, that she could
scarcely get her lips free. I cried, but he laughed,
and whispered a lot into her ear—all of it directed
against me, no doubt—and Thais kept looking at
me, and smiling. But after they’d seen Lamprias
coming, and had at last decided they’d had enough
of kissing each other, I went in spite of it all and lay


<pb n="v.7.p.369"/>


by his side, so that he wouldn’t have something more
to cast up to me afterwards. Thais jumped up and
was the first to dance, with her dress pulled up high,
as if she was the only one with a pretty pair of
ankles; when she’d finished, Lamprias kept quiet
and said nothing, but Diphilus praised her to the
skies for her fine dancing and her outfit, for the
skill of her feet in keeping time with the lyre, and
for her pretty ankles, and so on <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>, as if
he were praising the Sosandra of Calamis,
<note xml:lang="eng" n="7.369.1">A statuary of Periclean Athens; the Sosandra, a statue of Aphrodite, was somewhere on the Acropolis, Cf. <hi rend="italic">Essays in Portraiture</hi> 4.</note>
  rather
than Thais, whose appearance you know, as she
goes to the baths with us. And how she started
to mock me the next moment! “Anyone”, said
she, “who isn’t ashamed of having skinny legs will
get up and dance too.” What could I say, mother?
I got up and danced. What else was I to do? Sit
still, and prove the truth of the taunt, by allowing
Thais to be queen of the party?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MOTHER</speaker><p>You took yourself too seriously, my dear. You
shouldn’t have let it bother you. But tell me what
happened next.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHILINNA</speaker><p>The others all praised me, but Diphilus stretched
himself on his back and went on staring at the ceiling,
till I tired and stopped.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MOTHER</speaker><p>But is it true that you kissed Lamprias, and that
you went over and embraced him? Why don’t
you answer? Such conduct was past forgiving.</p></sp>


<pb n="v.7.p.371"/>
<sp><speaker>PHILINNA</speaker><p>I wanted to annoy him in return.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MOTHER</speaker><p>Then afterwards you wouldn’t sleep with him,
but sang songs, while he cried? Don’t you understand,
daughter, that we’re penniless? Do you
forget how much he has given us, and how we’d
have had to pass the last winter, if Aphrodite hadn’t
sent him to us?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHILINNA</speaker><p>What of it? Does that mean I’ve to put up with
such insults from him?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MOTHER</speaker><p>Be angry by all means, my daughter, but don’t
insult him back. Lovers insulted love no longer,
but speak severely to themselves. You’ve always
been hard on the fellow. Remember the proverb,
and take care that we don’t strain the rope to
breaking point.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>Bacchis, do you know any old woman of the kind
called Thessalians?
<note xml:lang="eng" n="7.371.1">i.e. witches, cf. p. 359.</note>
  There are said to be a lot of
them around. They use incantations and can make
a woman to be loved, no matter how much she is
hated before. My blessings on you, if you can bring




<pb n="v.7.p.373"/>


one of them to me. I would gladly give up these
dresses and all this gold, if I could only see Charinus
returning to me, and hating Simiche as he now hates
me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BACCHIS</speaker><p>What’s that? Don’t you live together any more?
Has Charinus gone off to Simiche, and left you,
Melitta, you for whose sake he had to face all that
parental fury, when he refused to marry that rich
girl who, they said, brought a dowry of five talents?
I heard that from your own mouth.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>That’s all over now, Bacchis, and for five days
now I haven’t so much as set eyes on him, while
the gentleman in question and Simiche have been
carousing with Pammenes, his companion.</p></sp>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:4" n="2">
<sp><speaker>BACCHIS</speaker><p>That is rotten for you, Melitta. But what parted
you? It must have been something serious.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>I can’t tell you the whole story. But the other
day, when he came back from the Piraeus—his
father had sent him there to recover some debt, I
believe—he didn’t look at me when he came in, or
take me in his arms when I ran over to him in my
usual way, but he pushed me away when I tried to
embrace him, and he said, “Go off with you to
Hermotimus, the shipowner, or read what’s written
on the walls at the Ceramicus,
<note xml:lang="eng" n="7.373.1">The Potters’ Quarter and the burial area of Athens.</note>
  where your names are




<pb n="v.7.p.375"/>


scribbled on a tombstone.” “What Hermotimus?”
I said, “Who’s he? What tombstone do you
mean?” He wouldn’t answer or take anything
to eat, and then went to bed with his back turned to
me. You can imagine all the tricks I tried in this
situation. I tried to hug him, and to turn him to
me, and kissed his back, though he kept turned
away from me. He didn’t soften a bit, but said, “If
you bother me any more, I’ll leave this instant, even
though it is midnight.”</p></sp>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:4" n="3">
<sp><speaker>BACCHIS</speaker><p>Did you know Hermotimus, though?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>May you see me in a more miserable state than at
present, my dear, if I know any shipowner called
Hermotimus. But next morning, as soon as the
cock crowed, he was up and away, but I remembered
his saying that the name was written on some wall
in the Ceramicus, and I sent Acis to look, but all
she could find was this, written near the Dipylon
Gate on the right as you go in; “Melitta loves
Hermotimus”, and again, a little lower down, “The
shipowner Hermotimus loves Melitta.”</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BACCHIS</speaker><p>Oh, those meddlesome youths! I understand it
all. Somebody wished to annoy Charinus, and
wrote it up, knowing he was jealous, and he believed
it at once. If I see him, I’ll have a word with him.
He’s a child still, and has no experience.</p></sp>


<pb n="v.7.p.377"/>
<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>Where can you see him, when he has shut himself
up with Simiche? His parents are still looking for
him at my house. But if only, Bacchis, we could
find an old woman, as I said! Her presence could
save me.</p></sp>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg069.perseus-eng3:4" n="4">
<sp><speaker>BACCHIS</speaker><p>Well, my dearest, there is a most useful witch, a
Syrian, who’s still very fresh and firm. Once, when
Phanias was angry with me without reason, just as
Charinus is with you, she reconciled him with me
after four whole months, when I’d already despaired
of him; but he was brought back to me by her
incantations.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>What did she charge, if you can still remember?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BACCHIS</speaker><p>She doesn’t ask a big fee, Melitta—just a drachma
and a loaf; besides that you must put out seven
obols, sulphur, and a torch along with the salt.
These are taken by the old woman; she must also
have a bowl of wine mixed, and drink it by herself.
You’ll also need something belonging to the man
himself, such as clothing or boots or a few of his
hairs or anything of that sort.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>I have his boots.</p></sp>

both your names. Then she plucks out a magic
wheel from her bosom, and whirls it round, rattling
off an incantation full of horrible outlandish names.
That’s what she did on that occasion, and shortly
afterwards, though at one and the same time his
friends told him off, and Phoebis, the lady whose
company he was keeping, pleaded desperately with
him, he returned to me; and it was mainly the
charm that brought him back. Yes, and she
impressed on me this spell for turning him against
Phoebis—to look out for any footprints she left, to
erase them, place my right foot where her left had
been, and vice versa, with feet pointing the other
way, and say, “I trample on you and am on top
of you.” These instructions I carried out.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MELITTA</speaker><p>Hurry, hurry, Bacchis. Fetch the Syrian woman
at once. And you, Acis, get ready the loaf and the
sulphur and all the other things for the spell.</p></sp>

Leaena, it’s high time we were in bed; you sleep
here between us.”</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LEAENA</speaker><p>At first they kissed me like men, not simply
bringing their lips to mine, but opening their mouths
a little, embracing me, and squeezing my breasts.
Demonassa even bit me as she kissed, and I didn’t
know what to make of it. Eventually Megilla,
being now rather heated, pulled off her wig, which
was very realistic and fitted very closely, and
revealed the skin of her head which was shaved close,
just as on the most energetic of athletes. This sight
gave me a shock, but she said, “Leaena, have you
ever seen such a good-looking young fellow?”
“I don’t see one here, Megilla,” said I. “Don’t make
a woman out of me,” said she. “My name is
Megillus, and I’ve been married to Demonassa here
for ever so long; she’s my wife.” I laughed at
that, Clonarium, and said, “Then, unknown to us,
Megillus, you were a man all the time, just as they
say Achilles once hid among the girls, and you have
everything that a man has, and can play the part of
a man to Demonassa?” “I haven’t got what you
mean,” said she, “I don’t need it at all. You’ll
find I’ve a much pleasanter method of my own.”


<pb n="v.7.p.385"/>


“You’re surely not a hermaphrodite,” said I,
“equipped both as a man and a woman, as many
people are said to be?”; for I still didn’t know,
Clonarium, what it was all about. But she said,
“No, Leaena, I’m all man.”</p></sp>

<sp><p> “Well,” I said, “I’ve
heard the Boeotian flute-girl, Ismenodora, repeating
tales she’d heard at home, and telling us how someone
at Thebes had turned from woman to man, someone
who was also an excellent soothsayer, and was,
I think, called Tiresias. That didn’t happen to you,
did it?” “No, Leaena,” she said, “I was born a
woman like the rest of you, but I have the mind and
the desires and everything else of a man.” “And
do you find these desires enough?” said I. “If
you don’t believe me Leaena,” said she, “just give
me a chance, and you’ll find I’m as good as any man;
I have a substitute of my own. Only give me a
chance, and you’ll see.”
Well I did, my dear, because she begged so hard,
and presented me with a costly necklace, and a very
fine linen dress. Then I threw my arms around her
as though she were a man, and she went to work,
kissing me, and panting, and apparently enjoying
herself immensely.</p></sp>

miserable life we’ve had these two years since your
father died, God rest his soul. But, while he lived,
we had plenty of everything; for he was a smith
with a great name in the Piraeus, and you can hear
anyone swear there never will be another smith to
follow Philinus. After his death, first of all I sold
his tongs, his anvil and his hammer for two minae,
and that kept us for seven months; since then I’ve
barely provided a starvation diet, now by weaving,
now by spinning thread for woof or warp. I’ve fed

and what money they earn? Dear lady Adrastia,
<note xml:lang="eng" n="7.391.1">Ἀδράστεια (perhaps from ἀ—διδράσκω = She whom none can escape) is another name for Nemesis, the goddess who watches after fair shares (i.e. from νέμω) for all, and punishes excessive good fortune in mortals, particularly when it is accompanied by pride. Perhaps Crobyle may be hoping that the mention of Nemesis’ name may save a prosperous friend from punishment by that goddess; a less likely alternative is that Crobyle is jealous of Lyra, and bringing her prosperity to the vengeful notice of Nemesis. See following note. She may, again, be hoping that Nemesis, as the goddess of fair shares, will bring her riches to compensate for her present poverty, just as she has done for Lyra and Daphnis.</note>

I certainly know that Daphnis’ daughter wore rags
before she grew up, but you can see what a figure she
cuts now, when she goes out with her gold, her gay
dresses and her four maids.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CORINNA</speaker><p>How did Lyra get all that?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CROBYLE</speaker><p>In the first place, she dresses attractively and
looks neat; she’s gay with all the men, without
being so ready to cackle as you are, but smiles in a
sweet bewitching way; later on, she’s very clever
when they’re together, never cheats a visitor or an
escort, and never throws herself at the men. If ever
she takes a fee for going out to dinner, she doesn’t
drink too much—that’s ridiculous, and men hate
women who do—she doesn’t gorge herself—that’s
ill-bred, my dear—but picks up the food with her
finger-tips, eating quietly and not stuffing both
cheeks full, and, when she drinks, she doesn’t gulp,
but sips slowly from time to time.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CORINNA</speaker><p>Even if she’s thirsty, mother?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CORBYLE</speaker><p>Then most of all, Corinna. Also, she doesn’t talk
too much or make fun of any of the company, and
has eyes only for her customer. These are the
things that make her popular with the men. Again,
when it’s time for bed, she’ll never do anything
coarse or slovenly, but her only aim is to attract the
man and make him love her; these are the things
they all praise in her. If you can learn all this, we’ll
be just as prosperous as she is. For, in all else,
compared with her, you’re a long way—but, good
Nemesis,
<note xml:lang="eng" n="7.393.1">The aposiopesis occurs because Crobyle realises that too proud boasts about her daughter may incur the jealous wrath of Nemesis. On such occasions the Greeks preferred to pray to Nemesis (cf. Aeschylus, <hi rend="italic">P.

up your nose at him, and slept with your Adonis,
Chaereas.</p></sp>

will give. Do you think you’ll be eighteen for ever,

dwindles. That’s what I tell you after twenty whole
years as a courtesan, whereas you, I think, are
eighteen or even younger. If you like, I’ll tell you
what happened to me not so very many years ago.
Demophantus, the money-lender, who lives behind
the Painted Stoa, was in love with me. He’s never
given me more than five drachmas, but regarded
himself as my master. His love was a superficial


<pb n="v.7.p.407"/>


thing, my dear, that never made him groan or weep
or appear at all hours at my doors, but he would
merely sleep with me at not very frequent intervals.</p></sp></div>

But, after the time when he came and I locked him
out, because I had with me Callides, the painter,
who had sent me ten drachmas, to start with he
went away abusing me. But, after many days had
passed, and there was no word from me, as I had
Callides in the house, eventually even Demophantus
began to burn and blaze with passion, and one day
he posted himself at my door and waited for it to
open. He began to weep and strike me, he threatened
to kill me, he tore my dress; there was nothing
he didn’t do, and in the end he gave me a talent and
kept me for himself alone for eight whole months.
His wife said I’d driven him mad by means of
drugs, but the only drug was his own jealousy. So,
Chrysis, you’d better use the same treatment on
Gorgias. He’ll be a rich young fellow if anything
happens to his father.</p></sp>

main point was his news of great wealth, of gold,
raiment, servants and ivory. He told me that the
money they were bringing in silver wasn’t counted
but measured by the bushel—and there were many
bushels. Parmeno himself had on his little finger
an enormous ring with many sides, which had set
in it a jewel of three colours, the top layer being red.
Well, I left him trying to tell me how they’d crossed
the Halys, and killed someone called Tiridates, and
how Polemo had distinguished himself in the battle
with the Pisidians. I went running off to bring you
this news, so that you can think what to do in

going with women, and I was his first woman, for

he went red, kept his eyes down and didn’t look in

the Academy. She followed as far as the Dipylon

she came back without any definite information.

other times praising Magidium, the harp-girl, when
we were dining together. These things make me

you were drinking with Thraso and Diphilus, the
company also included the flute-girl Cymbalium,

didn’t worry particularly at your kissing Cymbalium
five times. To kiss a woman like that was an insult

you bit off a piece of your apple, when you saw

stay away from her, told Dromo to bend down along
the top of the courtyard wall at its lowest part, and
let me mount his back. In that way I’d be able to
climb up more easily. To cut my story short, I got
over the wall, came here, and found the door carefully
bolted, for it was midnight. I didn’t knock,

and from the barbarians, for they too recognised me
by my shield in particular and by my spangles and
my crest. Tell us, Chenidas, whom did they all
think I resembled then?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHENIDAS</speaker><p>Achilles, of course, son of Peleus and Thetis. So
distinguished was your helmet, so bright your purple,
so resplendent your shield.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LEONTICHUS</speaker><p>When we met, the barbarian struck first, wounding
me slightly by grazing me with his spear just above
the knee, but I drove my lance through his shield,
and penetrated right through to his chest. Then
I rushed at him, lopped off his head with my blade
without any difficulty, and returned, not only with
his arms, but carrying his head fixed on my lance,
and bathed in blood.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>HYMNIS</speaker><p>Merely to listen to you, Leontichus, makes me feel
sick and shudder and imagine I see the ghosts and
phantoms of those you butchered and particularly
of that poor captain with his head split in two.
What do you think would have happened if I’d seen
the deed itself, and the blood, and the dead bodies

<sp><speaker>CHENIDAS</speaker><p>Yes, Leontichus. You frightened the simple
young girl by brandishing your plumes and recounting
your incredible feats. I could see at once
how pale she grew before you’d finished that story
about the captain, and how she puckered her brow,
and shivered when you said you’d split his head.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p>An excellent idea, Myrtale; let’s do that. First,
a pair of shoes from Sicyon worth two drachmas.
Put down two drachmas.</p></sp>

Gythium.

Not so long ago, when it was the feast of Aphrodite,
didn’t I put a silver drachma at the feet of the
goddess on your account? Then again I gave your
mother two drachmas for a pair of shoes, and many’s

no emeralds. Then there’s these earrings and that

when he sings, and tries to show his good

himself to a solo on the harp. Good luck to you,

child takes after his father! For my part I’ll find
a Delphis or a Cymbalium who’s more my own sort,

some music. The wine had begun to flow, I was
striking up one of my Lydian airs, the farmer was

Thus Diogenes (according to Aelian, <hi rend="italic">V.H</hi>. 12, 56) talks of the ignorance and boorishness of the Megarians, while Megara itself was regarded as a contemptible city. (Cf.

Well everything was turned upside down at once,

kicked as he lay on the ground. Somehow Crocale
was quick enough to escape next door to Thespias’
house, but I was slapped by Dinomachus, who then
threw my broken pipes after me, and told me to “get
