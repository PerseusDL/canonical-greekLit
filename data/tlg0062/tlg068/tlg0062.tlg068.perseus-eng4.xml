<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Release me, Zeus; I have suffered enough.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Release you? you? Why, by rights your irons should be heavier, you should have the whole weight of Caucasus upon you, and instead of one, a dozen vultures, not just pecking at — your liver, but scratching out your eyes. You made these: abominable human creatures to vex us, you stole our fire, you invented women. I need not remind you how you overreached me about the meat-offerings; my portion, bones disguised in fat: yours, all the good.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>And have I not been punished enough—riveted to the Caucasus all these years, feeding your bird (on which all worst curses light!) with my liver?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>"Tis not a tithe of your deserts,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Consider, I do not ask you to release me for nothing. I offer you information which is invaluable. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Promethean wiles!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Wiles? to what end? you can find the Caucasus another time; and there are chains to be had, if you catch me cheating.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Tell me first the nature of yout ‘invaluable’ offer.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>If I tell you your present errand right, will that convince you that I can prophesy too?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Of course it will.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>You are bound on a little visit to Thetis. <pb n="v.1.p.63"/></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Right so far. And the sequel? I trust you now. </p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Have no dealings with her, Zeus. As sure as Neteus’s daughter conceives by you, your child shall mete you the measure you meted to—</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>I shall lose my kingdom, you would say?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Avert it, Fate! I say only, that union portends this issue.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Thetis, farewell! and for this Hephaestus shall set you free. </p></sp></div> <docAuthor>Henry Watson Fowler</docAuthor> </div>

<sp><speaker>Eros</speaker>
<p>You might let me off, Zeus! I suppose it was rather too bad of me; but there!—I am but a child; a wayward child.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>A child, and born before Iapetus was ever thought of? You bad old man! Just because you have no beard, and no white hairs, are you going to pass yourself off for a child?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Eros</speaker>
<p>Well, and what such mighty harm has the old man ever done you, that you should talk of chains?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Ask your own guilty conscience, what harm. The pranks you have played me! Satyr, bull, swan, eagle, shower of gold,—I have been everything in my time; and I have you to thank for it. You never by any chance make the women in love with me; no one is ever smitten with my charms, that I have noticed. No, there must be magic in it always; I must be kept well out of sight. They like the bull or the swan well enough: but once let them set eyes on me, and they are frightened out of their lives. </p></sp></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg068.perseus-eng4:2" n="2">
<sp><speaker>Eros</speaker>
<p>Well, of course. They are but mortals; the sight of Zeus is too much for them.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Then why are Branchus and Hyacinth so fond of Apollo? <pb n="v.1.p.64"/></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Eros</speaker>
<p>Daphne ran away from him, anyhow; in spite of his beautiful hair and his smooth chin. Now, shall I tell you the way to win hearts? Keep that aegis of yours quiet, and leave the thunderbolt at home; make yourself as smart as you can; curl your hair and tie it up with a bit of ribbon, get a purple cloak, and gold-bespangled shoes, and march forth to the music of flute and drum;—and see if you don’t get a finer following than Dionysus, for all his Maenads.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Pooh! I'll win no hearts on such terms.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Eros</speaker>
<p>Oh, in that case, don’t fall in love. Nothing could be simpler.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>I dare say; but I like being in love, only I don’t like all this fuss. Now mind; if I let you off, it is on this understanding. </p></sp></div> <docAuthor>Francis George Fowler</docAuthor> </div>

<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>I do. Io, you mean?</p></sp>

<p>Yes; she is not a girl now, but a heifer.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>Magic at work! how did that come about?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Hera had a jealous fit, and transformed her. But that is not all; she has thought of a new punishment for the poor thing. She has put a cowherd in charge, who is all over eyes; this Argus, as he is called, pastures the heifer, and never goes to sleep.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>Well, what am I to do?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Fly down to Nemea, where the pasture is, kill Argus, take Io across the sea to Egypt, and convert her into Isis.

<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>Zeus! What is your opinion of this man Ixion?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Why, my dear, I think he is a very good sort of man; and the best of company. Indeed, if he were unworthy of our company, he would not be here.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>He is unworthy! He is a villain! Discard him!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Eh? What has he been after? I must know about this.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>Certainly you must; though I scarce know how to tell you. The wretch!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Oh, oh; if he is a ‘wretch,’ you must certainly tell me all about it. I know what ‘wretch’ means, on your discreet tongue. What, he has been making love? </p></sp></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg068.perseus-eng4:6" n="2">
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>And to me! to me of all people! It has been going on for a long time. At first, when he would keep looking at me, I had no idea—. And then he would sigh and groan; and when I handed my cup to Ganymede after drinking, he would insist on having it, and would stop drinking to kiss it, and lift it up to his eyes; and then he would look at me again. And then of course I knew. For a long time I didn’t like to say anything to you; I thought his mad fit would pass. But when he actually dared to speak to me, I left him weeping and grovelling about, and stopped my ears, so that I might not hear his impertinences, and came to tell you. It is for you to consider what steps you will take. </p></sp></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg068.perseus-eng4:6" n="3">
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Whew! I have a rival, I find; and with my own lawful wife. Here is a rascal who has tippled nectar to some purpose. Well, we have no one but ourselves to blame for it: we make too much of these mortals, admitting them -to our table like this. When they drink of our nectar, and behold the beauties of Heaven (so different from those of Earth!), ’tis no <pb n="v.1.p.66"/> wonder if they fall in love, and form ambitious schemes! Yes, Love is all-powerful; and not with mortals only: we Gods have sometimes fallen beneath his sway.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>He has made himself master of you; no doubt of that. He does what he likes with you;—leads you by the nose. You follow him whither he chooses, and assume every shape at his command; you are his chattel, his toy. I know how it will be: you are going to let Ixion off, because you have had relations with his wife; she is the mother of Pirithous. </p></sp></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg068.perseus-eng4:6" n="4">
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Why, what a memory you have for these little outings of mine!—Now, my idea about Ixion is this. It would never do to punish him, or to exclude him from our table; that would not look well. No; as he is so fond of you, so hard hit—even to weeping point, you tell me,—</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>Zeus! What are you going to say?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Don’t be alarmed. Let us make a cloud-phantom in your likeness, and after dinner, as he lies awake (which of course he will do, being in love), let us take it and lay it by his side. Twill put him out of his pain: he will fancy he has attained his desire.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>Never! The presumptuous villain!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Yes, I know. But what harm can it do to you, if Ixion makes a conquest of a cloud? </p></sp></div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg068.perseus-eng4:6" n="5">
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>But he will think that I am the cloud; he will be working his wicked will upon me for all he can tell.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Now you are talking nonsense. The cloud is not Hera, and Hera is not the cloud. Ixion will be deceived; that is all.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>Yes, but these men are all alike—they have no delicacy. I suppose, when he goes home, he will boast to every one of how he has enjoyed the embraces of Hera, the wife of Zeus! Why, he may tell them that I am in love with him! And they will believe it; they will know nothing about the cloud. <pb n="v.1.p.67"/></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>If he says anything of the kind he shall soon find himself in Hades, spinning round on a wheel for all eternity. That will keep him busy! And serve him right; not for falling in love—I see no great harm in that—but for letting his tongue wag. </p></sp></div> <docAuthor>Francis George Fowler</docAuthor> </div>

<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Have you seen Maia’s baby, Apollo? such a pretty little thing, with a smile for everybody; you can see it is going to be a treasure,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>That baby a treasure? well, in mischief, Iapetus is young beside it.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Why, what harm can it do, only just born?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Ask Posidon; it stole his trident. Ask Ares; he was surprised to find his sword gone out of the scabbard. Not to mention myself, disarmed of bow and arrows. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>He has been.</p></sp>

<p>Well? all your tools safe? none missing?</p></sp>

<p>Of course not.</p></sp>

<p>I advise you to make sure.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Zeus! where are my pincers?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Ah, you will find them among the baby-linen,</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Ah, and you don’t know what a glib young chatterbox he is; and, if he has his way, he is to be our errand-boy! Yesterday he challenged Eros—tripped up his heels somehow, and had <pb n="v.1.p.68"/> him on his back in a twinkling; before the applause was over, he had taken the opportunity of a congratulatory hug from Aphrodite to steal her girdle; Zeus had not done laughing before— the sceptre was gone. If the thunderbolt had not been too heavy, and very hot, he would have made away with that too.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>The child has some spirit in him, by your account.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Spirit, yes—and some music, moreover, young as he is.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>He picked up a dead tortoise somewhere or other, and contrived an instrument with it. He fitted horns to it, with a cross-bar, stuck in pegs, inserted a bridge, and played a sweet tuneful thing that made an old harper like me quite envious. Even at night, Maia was saying, he does not stay in Heaven; he goes down poking his nose into Hades—on a thieves’ errand, no doubt. Then he has a pair of wings, and he has made himself a magic wand, which he uses for marshalling souls—convoying the dead to their place.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Ah, I gave him that, for a toy.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>

<p>What are your orders, Zeus? You sent for me, and here I am; with such an edge to my axe as would cleave a stone at one blow.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Ah; that’s right, Hephaestus. Just split my head in half, will you?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>You think I am mad, perhaps?—Seriously, now, what can I do for you?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>What I say: crack my skull. Any insubordination, <pb n="v.1.p.69"/> now, and you shall taste my resentment; it will not be the first time. Come, a good lusty stroke, and quick about it. I am in the pangs of travail; my brain is in a whirl.</p></sp>

<p>Mind you, the consequences may be serious: the axe is sharp, and will prove but a rough midwife,</p></sp>

<p>Hew away, and fear nothing. I know what I am about.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>H’m. I don’t like it: however, one must obey orders. ... Why, what have we here? A maiden in full armour! This is no joke, Zeus. You might well be waspish, with this great girl growing up beneath your pia mater; in armour, too! You have been carrying a regular barracks on your shoulders all this time. Go active too! See, she is dancing a war-dance, with shield and spear in full swing. She is like one inspired; and (what is more to the point) she is extremely pretty, and has come to marriageable years in these few minutes; those grey eyes, even, look well beneath a helmet. Zeus, I claim her as the fee for my midwifery.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Impossible! She is determined to remain a maid for ever. Not that I have any objection, personally.</p></sp>

<p>That is all I want. You can leave the rest tome. I'll carry her off this moment.</p></sp>

I have told him many a time that if he would not behave himself I would break his artillery for him, and clip his wings; and before now I have smacked his little behind with my slipper.

<p>Child, child, you must think what you are doing. It is bad enough on earth,—you are always inciting men to do some mischief, to themselves or to one another;—but I am speaking of the Gods.

As for the naughty tricks you play on your own mother, you know you are safe there. But Rhea! how could you dare to set her on thinking of that young fellow in Phrygia, an old lady like her, the mother of so many Gods? Why, <pb n="v.1.p.71"/> you have made her quite mad: she harnesses those lions of ers, and drives about all over Ida with the Corybantes, who are as mad as herself, shrieking high and low for Attis; and there they are, slashing their arms with swords, rushing about over the hills, like wild things, with dishevelled hair, blowing horns, beating drums, clashing cymbals; all Ida is one mad tumult. I am quite uneasy about it; yes, you wicked boy, your poor mother is quite uneasy: some day when Rhea is in one of her mad fits (or when she is in her senses, more likely), she will send the Corybantes after you, with orders to tear you to pieces, or throw you to the lions.

I get on to their backs every now and then, and take hold of their manes, and ride them about; and when I put my hand into their mouths, they only lick it, and let me take it out again. Besides, how is Rhea going to have time to attend to me? She is too busy with Attis. And I see no harm in just pointing out beautiful things to people; they can leave them alone;—it is nothing to do with me.

He resembles any one rather than his father.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Zeus</speaker>
<p>Anyhow, my dear, this wearer of ribbons, this woman among women, not content with conquering Lydia, subduing Thrace, and enthralling the people of Tmolus, has been on an expedition all the way to India with his womanish host, captured elephants, taken possession of the country, and led their king captive after a brief resistance. And he never stopped dancing all the time, never relinquished the thyrsus and the ivy; always drunk (as you say) and always inspired! If any scoffer presumes to make light of his ceremonial, he does not go unpunished; he is bound with vine-twigs; or his own mother mistakes him for a fawn, and tears him limb from limb.

<p>Well, please point out to them, Hermes, that the losers must not be angry with me; the fault will be in my eyes only.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>That is quite understood. And now to work.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>I must do what I can; there is no help for it. But first let me ask,—am I just to look at them as they are, or must I go into the matter thoroughly?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>That is for you to decide, in virtue of your office. You have only to give your orders; it is as you think best.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>As I think best? Then I will be thorough.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>Get ready, ladies. Now, Mr. Umpire.—I will look the other way. </p></sp></div>

<p>I approve your decision, Paris. I will be the first to submit myself to your inspection. You shall see that I have more to boast of than white arms and large eyes: nought of me but is beautiful.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>Aphrodite, will you also prepare?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Athene</speaker>
<p>Oh, Paris,—make her take off that girdle, first; there is magic in it; she will bewitch you. For that matter, she has no right to come thus tricked out and painted,—just like a courtesan! She ought to show herself unadorned.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>They are right about the girdle, madam; it must go.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Aphrodite</speaker>
<p>Oh, very well, Athene: then take off that helmet, and show your head bare, instead of trying to intimidate the judge with that waving plume. I suppose you are afraid the colour of your eyes may be noticed, without their formidable surroundings. <pb n="v.1.p.83"/></p></sp>

<p>God of wonders! What loveliness is here! Oh, rapture! How exquisite these maiden charms! How dazzling the majesty of Heaven’s true queen! And oh, how sweet, how enthralling is Aphrodite’s smile! 'Tis too much, too much of happiness.—But perhaps it would be well for me to view each in detail; for as yet I doubt, and know not where to look; my eyes are drawn all ways at once.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Aphrodite</speaker>
<p>Yes, that will be best.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>Withdraw then, you and Athene; and let Hera remain,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Hera</speaker>
<p>So be it; and when you have finished your scrutiny, you have next to consider, how you would like the present which I offer you. Paris, give me the prize of beauty, and you shall be lord of all Asia.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>But I have nothing to do with fighting, Athene. As you see, there is peace throughout all Lydia and Phrygia, and my father’s dominion is uncontested.

<p>Here I am; take your time, and examine carefully; let nothing escape your vigilance. And I have something else to say to you, handsome Paris. Yes, you handsome boy, I have long had an eye on you; I think you must be the handsomest young fellowin all Phrygia. But it is such a pity that you don’t leave these rocks and crags, and live in a town: you will lose all <pb n="v.1.p.84"/> your beauty in this desert. What have you to do with mountains? What satisfaction can your beauty give to a lot of cows? You ought to have been married long ago; not to any of these dowdy women hereabouts, but to some Greek girl; an Argive, perhaps, or a Corinthian, or a Spartan; Helen, now, is a Spartan, and such a pretty girl—quite as pretty as -I am—and so susceptible! Why, if she once caught sight of you, she would give up everything, I am sure, to go with you, and a most devoted wife she would be. But you have heard of Helen, of course?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>No, ma’am; but I should like to hear all about her now. </p></sp></div>

<p>Well, she is the daughter of Leda, the beautiful woman, you know, whom Zeus visited in the disguise of a swan.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>And what is she like?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Aphrodite</speaker>
<p>She is fair, as might be expected from the swan, soft as down (she was hatched from an egg, you know), and such a lithe, graceful figure; and only think, she is so much admired, that there was a war because Theseus ran away with her; and she was a mere child then. And when she grew up, the very first men in Greece were suitors for her hand, and she was given to Menelaus, who is descended from Pelops.—Now, if you like, she shall be your wife.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>What, when she is married already?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Aphrodite</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>But that is what I cannot believe,—that she will forsake her husband to cross the seas with a stranger, a barbarian.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Aphrodite</speaker>
<p>Trust me for that. I have two beautiful children, <pb n="v.1.p.85"/> Love and Desire. They shall be your guides. Love will assail her in all his might, and compel her to love you: Desire will encompass you about, and make you desirable and lovely as himself; and I will be there to help. I can get the Graces to come too, and between us we shall prevail.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Paris</speaker>
<p>How this will end, I know not. All I do know is, that I am in love with Helen already. I see her before me—I sail for Greece—I am in Sparta—I am on my homeward journey, with her at my side! Ah, why is none of it true? </p></sp></div>

<p>You don’t suppose I should say this to every one; I am not afraid of you; I know you can keep a quiet tongue. I must tell you what made me laugh most while he stormed: I remember not’so long ago, when Posidon and Hera and Athene rebelled and made a plot for his capture and imprisonment, he was frightened out of his wits; well, there were only three of them, and if Thetis had not taken pity on him and called in the hundredhanded Briareus to the rescue, he would actually have been put in chains, with his thunder and his bolt beside him.

<p>What have you been about, you villanous Titan? You have utterly done for the earth, trusting your car to a silly boy like that; he has got too near and scorched it in one place, and in another killed everything with frost by withdrawing the heat too far; there is not a single thing he has not turned upside down; if I had not seen what was happening and upset him with the thunderbolt, there would not have been a remnant of mankind left.

<p>Oh, of course you didn’t know what a delicate business it is, and how the slightest divergence ruins everything! it never occurred to you that the horses are spirited, and want a tight hand! oh no! why, give them their heads a moment, and they are out of control; just what happened: they carried him now left, now right, now clean round backwards, and up or down, just at their own sweet will; he was utterly helpless. </p></sp></div>

I showed him how to stand, and how far he was to mount upwards, and where to begin descending, and how to hold the reins, and keep the spirited beasts under control; and I told him how dangerous it was, if he did not keep the track.. But, poor boy, when he found himself in charge of all that fire, and looking down into yawning space, he was frightened, and no wonder; and the horses soon knew I was not behind them, took the child’s measure, left the track, and wrought all this havoc; he let go the reins—I suppose he was afraid of being thrown out—and held on to the rail.
