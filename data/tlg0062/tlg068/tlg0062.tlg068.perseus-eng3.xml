<sp><speaker>ARES</speaker><p>My dear Hermes, have you heard Zeus’ threats? How proud and preposterous they are! “If I please”, says he, “I’ll let a cord <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.241.1">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, VIII, 17-27, also referred to in <hi rend="italic">Zeus Catechized</hi> 4.</note> down from heaven; you’ll be hanging on it, trying with all your might to pull me down, but you’ll be wasting all your efforts, for you’ll never succeed. And, if I choose to tug up, it won’t be only you, but I’ll pull up the earth and the sea into the bargain, and leave the lot dangling in mid-air.” He goes on and on like that. You’ve heard it all too. I’ll admit that he’s more than a match and too strong for any one of us, but that he’s too much for all of us put together, so that, even if we have the earth and the sea with us, our weight wouldn’t overpower him—that I’ll never believe.</p></sp> </div>

<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Hush, Ares. It isn’t safe to talk like that, or we may be sorry for our silly chatter.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>ARES</speaker><p>Do you think I’d have said that to just anyone, or only to you? I knew you would hold your <pb n="v.7.p.243"/> tongue. But I must tell you what struck me as most ridiculous as I listened to his threats. I remember, just the other day, when Poseidon and Hera and Athena rebelled, <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.243.1">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, I, 396 ff.</note> and were plotting to catch him and clap him in irons, he was crazy with terror though there were only three of them. And in irons he would have been, thunder and lightning and all, if Thetis had not been sorry for him, and called in to his help Briareos with his hundred hands. When I thought of that, I had to laugh at his fine talk.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Quiet, I tell you. It’s dangerous for you to talk like that, and for me to listen.</p></sp></div> </div>

<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>Good day to you, Hermes, Daddy mine.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>And a bad day to you. But how am I your daddy?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>Aren’t you Hermes of Cyllene?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Yes. How, then, are you my son?</p></sp> <pb n="v.7.p.245"/> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>I’m your bastard boy, your love-child.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Oh quite so, when some billy-goat, I suppose, led a nanny astray! How could you be mine, you with your horns and ugly snout and shaggy beard and a goat’s cloven hooves and a tail over your behind?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>When you jeer at me, daddy, you’re mocking your own son, or rather yourself for producing such creatures as your children. It’s not my fault.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Who do you say your mother was? Perhaps I led a nanny astray without knowing it.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>No, not a nanny. But try to remember if you ever forced your attentions on a freeborn girl in Arcadia. Why are you biting your nails and thinking so hard? Why so puzzled? I’m speaking of Icarius’ girl, Penelope. <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.245.1">Lucian (with Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Natura Deorum</hi>, III, 22) follows Herodotus, II, 145 in making Pan the son of Penelope. There are other versions of his birth, of which the most important is the Homeric <hi rend="italic">Hymn to Pan</hi> 34, where his mother is the daughter of Dryops.</note> </p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Then what possessed her to produce in you a child not like me but like a goat?</p></sp> <pb n="v.7.p.247"/> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg068.perseus-eng3:2" n="2"> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>I’ll tell you what she said herself. When she was packing me off to Arcadia, she said, “My boy, I, Penelope, a true blue Spartan, am your mother, but your father, let me tell you, is a god, Hermes, son of Maia and Zeus. Don’t worry because you have horns and a goat’s shanks, for when your father came courting me, he made himself into a goat so that no one would notice him. That’s why you’ve turned out like the goat.”</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Ah, yes. I do remember doing something like that. Am I, then, to be called your father? I, who am so proud of my good looks! I, who’ve still got a smooth chin! Am I to be laughed at by all for having such a bonny boy?</p></sp> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg068.perseus-eng3:2" n="3"> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>But I won’t disgrace you, father. I’m a musician and play the pipe loud and true. Dionysus is lost without me, and has made me his companion and fellow-reveller; I’m his dance-leader, and if you could see how many flocks I have around Tegea and on Parthenium, you’d be delighted. I’m lord and master of all Arcadia. Besides that, the other day, I fought so magnificently on the side of the Athenians at Marathon that a prize of valour was chosen for me—the cave under the Acropolis. <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.247.1">Cf. Herodotus, VI, 105, Euripides, <hi rend="italic">Ion</hi>, 492 ff., Lucian, <hi rend="italic">Double Indictment</hi> 9, and <hi rend="italic">Lover of Lies</hi> 3.</note> Anyhow, go to Athens and you’ll soon find out what a great name Pan has there.</p></sp> <pb n="v.7.p.249"/> </div>

<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Tell me, are you married yet, Pan? Pan’s the name they give you, isn’t it?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>Of course not, daddy. I’m romantically inclined, and wouldn’t like to have to confine my attentions to just one.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>No doubt, then, you try your luck with the nanny-goats?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>A fine jest coming from you! My lady-friends are Echo and Pitys and all the Maenads of Dionysus, and I’m in great demand with them.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Please do me a favour, son. I’ve never asked one from you before.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PAN</speaker><p>Tell me what you want, daddy, and let me see to it.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>You may come here and pay your respects to me, but please don’t call me daddy when anyone can hear.</p></sp></div> </div>

<sp><speaker>APOLLO</speaker><p>What can we make of it? Won’t we have to admit that Eros and Hermaphroditus and Priapus, <pb n="v.7.p.251"/> though sons of the same mother, are utterly different in appearance and habits? Eros is really handsome, and an archer invested with great power, and lord of all. Hermaphroditus is an effeminate pansy, half one thing and half the other in appearance, for you can’t tell whether he’s boy or girl; whereas Priapus is quite indecently masculine.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>DIONYSUS</speaker><p>There’s no need to be surprised, Apollo. It’s not Aphrodite’s fault, but the fathers were different. <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.251.1">Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes and Priapus of Dionysus; Eros is nariously described as the son of Ares or Zeus or indeed Hermes; he is probably regarded by Lucian as the son of Ares rather than of Zeus.</note> Why, even when the father’s the same, the one mother often has both boys and girls in her family. Take for example your sister and yourself.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>APOLLO</speaker><p>Quite so, but we are alike and have the same interests. We’re both archers.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>DIONYSUS</speaker><p>The same as far as the bow goes, Apollo, but no farther, for Artemis kills visitors in Scythia, while you are a prophet and healer of the sick.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>APOLLO</speaker><p>What? Do you think my sister likes her Scythians? Why, the moment a Greek reaches Taurica, she’s all ready and waiting to sail off with him, in disgust at their human sacrifices. <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.251.2">A reference to the <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia in Tauris</hi> of Euripides, where Iphigenia, as priestess of Artemis, is compelled to-sacrifice foreigners to the goddess, but sails off with Orestes and Pylades, who carry off with them the statue of Artemis. Cf. <hi rend="italic">On Sacrifices</hi> 13.</note> </p></sp> <pb n="v.7.p.253"/> </div>

<sp><speaker>DIONYSUS</speaker><p>And the best thing she could do. But now as for Priapus—I’ll tell you something really funny. The other day—it was in Lampsacus—I was passing the city, when he invited me home with him, and put me up for the night. Now we’d gone to sleep in his dining-room, after and were pretty well soaked, when about midnight up gets our bold lad—but I’m ashamed to tell you.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>APOLLO</speaker><p>And made an attempt on you, Dionysus?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>DIONYSUS</speaker><p>Something like that.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>APOLLO</speaker><p>How did you deal with the situation?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>DIONYSUS</speaker><p>What could I do but laugh?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>APOLLO</speaker><p>The best thing too, no bad temper or violence. He’d some excuse for making an attempt on you. You’re so good-looking.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>DIONYSUS</speaker><p>As far as that goes, he might make an attempt on you too, Apollo. You’re so handsome and have such a fine head of hair, that he might assault you, even when he was sober.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>APOLLO</speaker><p>Oh no, he won’t. I have arrows as well as long hair.</p></sp> <pb n="v.7.p.255"/></div> </div>

<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Is there a god in heaven, mother, more miserable than I am?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>MAIA</speaker><p>Hermes, dear, you mustn’t talk like that.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Why shouldn’t I, when I’m so busy—and the only one that does a hand’s turn, too—quite distracted with so many different jobs? I must be up at crack of dawn, and sweep the dining-room, seeing to the cushions on the couch and tidying everything up, and then be at Zeus’ beck and call, a courier to carry his messages high and low, and the moment I’m back, I’ve to lay out the ambrosia, without even time for a wash; and before his latest acquisition, thi nectar as well. But worst of all, it’s just the same at night. I’m the only one that loses hiss wine waiter, arrived, I used to pour out the sleep, and must be busy then too—for Pluto, this time, acting as guide of souls and usher of the dead, and then be on duty with Justice Rhadamanthys. My day’s work isn’t enough for me, it seems, on the go in the wrestling schools, announcing in parliament, and training speakers, but I’ve to help out with the dead as well, for they all want their share of me. </p></sp></div>

Yes, and the sons of Alcmena and Semele, <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.257.1">Heracles and Dionysus respectively. See <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>, XI, 602.</note> whose mothers were only women, and came to a bad end, can gorge themselves without a care in the world, while I, the son of Maia, the daughter of Atlas, must wait on them hand and foot. Now I’m just back from Cadmus’ daughter at Sidon, <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.257.2">Lucian seems to have made a mistake here and to be referring to Europa. In <hi rend="italic">Dea Syria</hi> 4 and <hi rend="italic">D. Mar.</hi> 15 he more correctly makes her the sister of Cadmus and daughter of Agenor (cf. Herodotus, 4.147, etc., although the version of <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, XIV, 321 makes her the daughter of Phoenix). He can scarcely be referring to Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, who (cf. p. 201, Apollodorus, 3.4.3 and Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met</hi>. 3.313) was entrusted with the care of the infant Dionysus. Dionysus earlier in the dialogue is at a later stage of his development as he is already able to feast with Heracles, presumably in heaven.</note> where he sent me to see how things were with her, and, without giving me time to get my breath back, he’s sent me off again to Argos to have a look at Danae, and “Then”, says he, “you’d better go on from there to Boeotia, and take a peep at Antiope on your way”. But I’m quite fagged out already. If only it were possible, I’d gladly have asked to be sold in the market, like slaves on earth who find their lot too bad. <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.257.3">Discontented slaves could ask to be sold. Cf. Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">De Superstitione</hi>, 166 D, and Pollux, 7.13 (quoting Eupolis).</note> </p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>MAIA</speaker><p>Enough of that, my lad. You must do everything your father wants. You’re still a youngster. Off with you now to Argos, as you were told, and then to Boeotia, or you may get a whipping for dawdling. Lovers have sharp tempers.</p></sp></div> </div>

<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>Exactly, even if you do think it odd. The fact is that Hera—you know how jealous she is—talked Semele into persuading Zeus to visit her complete with thunder and lightning. He agreed, and came with his thunderbolt too; the roof caught fire, and Semele was burnt up, and he told me to cut open her womb, and bring him the half-formed seven-month child. When I did so, he cut a slit in his own thigh, and slipped it in to finish its growth there; now, two months later, he’s brought it into the world, and he’s ill from the birth-pains.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>POSEIDON</speaker><p>Then, where’s the baby now?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>I took him to Nysa, and gave him to the Nymphs to bring up. His name is Dionysus.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>POSEIDON</speaker><p>Is my brother, then, both father and mother of Dionysus?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>APHRODITE</speaker><p>Eros, my boy, you must watch what you’re about. I don’t mean on earth, when you persuade men to work against themselves or each other, but in heaven too, when you make Zeus turn into shape after shape, changing him into whatever you choose for the time, and bring Lady Moon down from the sky, and sometimes keep the Sun-god lingering at Clymene’s side forgetful of his driving. You may go scot-free <pb n="v.7.p.333"/> for the liberties you take with me, your mother but you’ve had the audacity even to turn the thoughts of Rhea to love of boys and have her pining for that Phrygian lad <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.333.1">Attis. Cf. <hi rend="italic">On Sacrifices</hi> 5 and 7.</note> —at her time of life, too, and she the mother of so many gods! Now you’ve driven her mad, and she’s taken her team of lions and her Corybants, who are just as mad as herself, and is wandering up and down Ida; she keeps shrieking for Attis, while the Corybants slash their arms with swords, or let down their hair and rush madly over the mountains, or blow on the horn, thunder on the drums, or bang cymbals; it’s just chaotic frenzy all over Ida. So I fear everything; yes, your mother’s afraid of such goings on, for you’re just one big nuisance, and I’m scared that one day Rhea, in a fit of madness, or, more likely, when still in her right mind, will tell her Corybants to catch you and tear you to pieces or throw you to her lions. That’s what I fear, when I see you running such risks.</p></sp> </div>

But what time will Rhea have to devote to me? She’s thinking of Attis the whole time. Anyway, what harm do I do by showing what beauty is like?

<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker><p>He’d known about all this for a long time, and had been out to catch them. He put invisible cords round the bed, and went off to work at his furnace. Then Ares crept in, unnoticed, as he thought, but the Sun-god saw him and told Hephaestus. And when they’d got on the bed, and were in the act, and in his trap, the cords folded themselves round about <pb n="v.7.p.337"/> them, and Hephaestus put in an appearance. Aphrodite, being in the nude, was most embarrassed that she couldn’t hide her nakedness, while Ares tried at first to escape, hoping to break the cords, but later on, realising he was prisoner and couldn’t escape, kept begging for mercy.</p></sp> </div>

Indeed he’s like anyone but you his father, Zeus.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker><p>Yet, Hera, this wearer of females’ ribbons, this “bigger softie than the women”, has subdued Lydia and the inhabitants of Tmolus, and forced the Thracians into subjection; he’s been on an expedition against Indians with this army of women, capturing their elephants and seizing their country, and when their king dared to stand up to him for a little, he took him prisoner and carried him off; and while he was doing all this, he was dancing and cavorting the whole time, and used nothing but wands of ivy, drunk and possessed though you say he was. And if any one dares to scoff at his rites and <pb n="v.7.p.341"/> insult him, punishes him by tying him up with vine-twigs *, or makes the mans mother tear him to pieces as though he were a fawn. <note xml:lang="eng" n="7.341.1">A reference to Pentheus, who was torn to pieces by his mother Agave.

<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker><p>That doesn’t get you anywhere. You can’t blame wine or Dionysus for such things, but drinking to excess, and swilling down neat wine beyond what’s decent. But the man who drinks in moderation will become more cheerful and better company, and never treat any of his cronies as Icarius was treated.

<sp><speaker>APHRODITE</speaker><p>Well, didn’t you find Ares more frightening? Yet you disarmed him and conquered him.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>EROS</speaker><p>No. He’s glad to welcome and encourage me, but Athena always glowers at me.

Yes, and I warned him how dangerous it was not to drive straight, but the poor boy, mounted on so great a fire and looking down on yawning space, lost his nerve, and can you wonder? Then the horses, sensing it wasn’t me in the chariot, didn’t care two hoots for the lad and left their course with these terrible results. He dropped the reins—I suppose he was afraid of falling out, and clung to the rail. But he’s already had his punishment, Zeus, and my grief is punishment enough for me.</p></sp> </div>
