<label>Mnesippos</label> What do you say, Toxaris? Do you Scythians sacrifice to
Orestes and Pylades, and believe in
them as gods?</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> We sacrifice to them,
certainly; still we do not hold them to be gods,
but good men.</p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> But is it customary with you to sacrifice to good men, too, when they die, just as you
do to the gods?</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> Not only that, but we keep feast-days
and holidays in their honor.</p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> What do you hope to get from them?
Surely you don't offer sacrifice for the sake of
getting the good-will of dead men.</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> It is no harm to have even the dead
on your side. But we also consider that we act
for the advantage of the living by keeping the
great and good in mind, and for this reason we
honor the dead. For it is our belief that by these
means many of our people will conceive a desire
to be such men as these were.</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="2">
<p><label>Mnesippos</label> You are right about that. But what
was it you found so admirable in Orestes and


<pb n="v.1.p.190"/>



Pylades that you raised them to equality with the
gods, though they were strangers in your land
and your bitter foes? For when the Scythians
of that day had seized them after their shipwreck
and driven them off to be sacrificed to Artemis,
they set upon the jailers, overpowered the guard,
slew the king, carried off the priestess, and actually stole the statue of Artemis herself and set
sail, laughing at the commonwealth of Scythia.
Now, if this is the sort of thing you honor the
men for, you cannot be too quick to produce many
like them. But consider yourselves what the result will be, to judge from the past—whether it is
to your advantage to have many cases of Orestes
and Pylades sailing into Scythian ports. To my
mind this would be the quickest way to become
irreverent and godless yourselves, and to banish
the surviving gods from your country. Then, I
suppose, you will transfer your devotions from
the whole body of gods to the men who come to
steal them, and sacrifice to your temple-robbers
as if they were divine.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="3">
<p>But if it is not for these
achievements that you honor Orestes and Pylades,
tell me, Toxaris, what else they ever did for your
good, in return for which you have now reversed
your former judgment and sacrifice to them,
bringing victims to those who once came extremely near being victims themselves. It seems
absurdly inconsistent with the past.


<pb n="v.1.p.191"/></p>

<p><label>Toxaris</label> And yet, Mnesippos, those were noble
deeds, though you laugh at them. Just think,
they were only two men, and yet they dared this
gallant adventure; sailed all this distance from
home and ventured into the Pontos, unknown as
yet to the Greeks, except those who manned the
Argo in the expedition against Kolchis, and they
were not frightened by the stories about this sea
or its name of "The Inhospitable," gained for
it, I suppose, by the savage tribes on its shores.
And when they were captured they took the affair
in such a courageous way that they were not contented merely to make their escape, but when
they had first taken their revenge and carried off
the statue of Artemis, then they sailed away.
Now, are not these wonderful achievements, and
really worthy of divine honor from any one who
gives bravery his approval? Still, it is not because we see these traits in Orestes and Pylades
that we deem them heroes.</p>

<p><label>Mnesippos</label> Do go on and tell of something else
they did, really divine and godlike. As far as
their voyage and their journey into foreign lands
are concerned, I could show you a great many

the Phoenicians, who not only sailed into the
Pontos and as far as the Maiotis and the Bosporos, but to every point in Greek or barbarian wa-

every cape and every peninsula, so to speak, and
late in the autumn they sail back to their own
country. To be consistent, you hold these, too,
as gods-peddlers, and perhaps fish-mongers,
though most of them be.</p>

<p><label>Toxaris</label> Now listen, my amazing friend, and
observe how much more candidly we barbarians
judge good men than you Greeks. In Argos and
Mykenai there is not even a noble tomb to be
seen of Orestes and Pylades, but in our country
there is shown a temple raised to them in common, as was natural since they were comrades,
and sacrifices are offered to them and all other
honors. The fact that they were foreigners, not
Scythians, does not in the least prevent their
being adjudged good men. For we do not ask
whence noble and good people come, and we
bear them no grudge for working good deeds,
even if they are not our friends. On the contrary we applaud their acts, and adopt them as
countrymen on the strength of them. But what
we chiefly wondered at and praised in these men
was this, that they seemed to us to be the noblest
pair of friends in the world, and authorized to
lay down for the rest of mankind the principle
that friends must share all fortunes, and thus win
the reverence of the best of the Scythians.

Our ancestors inscribed an account of their
sufferings with each other, or for each other, on a


<pb n="v.1.p.193"/>

bronze pillar and set it up as an offering in the
Oresteion, making a law that the earliest training
and education of their children should be to learn
by heart the inscription on this pillar. The result is that it would be easier for one of them to
forget his father's name than to be in ignorance
of the deeds of Orestes and Pylades. Moreover,
on the wall enclosing the temple there are ancient
pictures displaying everything related on the pillar. One shows Orestes sailing in company with
his friend; another shows him captured after his
ship went to pieces on the rocks and made ready
for the sacrifice, with Iphigeneia in the act of beginning the ceremony. On the opposite wall he
is seen at the moment when he had burst his
bonds and was killing Thoas and a number of
other Scythians, and, finally, they are painted
sailing away with Iphigeneia and the goddess.
The Scythians are vainly trying to stop the ship,
which is already under sail, and are hanging in
the rigging and trying to board her; but they fail
completely and some get wounded, and others,
in fear of a like fate, swim off to land.

In this
picture we can see best how much tenderness
they showed for each other in the struggle with
the Scythians. For the artist has depicted each
careless of his own opponents, but warding off
attacks on his friend, and trying to receive the
missiles intended for him, thinking it nothing to

die in saving his friend and taking on his own
body the blow aimed at the other.
Such devotion as this of theirs, such partnership in dangers, the faithfulness and good-fellowship and honesty and firmness of their mutual
love, seemed to us not to belong to human nature,
but to a finer temperament than that of men. For
the majority, as long as the wind is favorable,
take it ill if their friends do not divide their pleasures with them in equal shares, but if there comes
the least breath of adversity they leave them to
face danger alone. I will tell you another thing,
too, that there is no office of friendship that a
Scythian thinks greater, nor anything in which
he takes more pride, than helping a friend in trouble and sharing his dangers, so that we think the
hardest name a man can be called is "traitor to
friendship." This is the reason we honor Orestes
and Pylades, who were the best in what the Scythians deem good, and pre-eminent in friendship,
which we admire above all things. So we have
given them the name of “Korakoi,” which in our
language signifies "genii of friendship."</p>

<p><label>Mnesippos</label> Toxaris, I see that the Scythians
have not only been great archers, and better
than other nations in warlike pursuits, but are
also the most persuasive orators in the world.
For though I was of the other opinion a while
ago, I now think you are quite right to deify


<pb n="v.1.p.195"/>


Orestes and Pylades. And I had no idea, my
dear fellow, that you were a good painter as well.
You have brought before me most vividly the
pictures in the Oresteion, and the battle of the
heroes and their vicarious wounds; but I never
should have supposed that friendship was made
so much of among the Scythians. I thought that
inasmuch as they are inhospitable and wild, they
dwelt together in constant feud and passion and
anger, and entertained no friendship towards
even their next of kin, judging from the things
we hear of them, and particularly that they eat
their fathers when they are dead.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="9">

<p><label>Toxaris</label> Whether we are juster and more
pious than the Greeks in these other matters,
such as our relations with our parents, is not a
point that I care to dispute with you at present;
but it is easy to show that Scythian friends are
far truer than Greek friends, and friendship is
made more of by us than by you. Now, by the
gods of the Greeks, do not take it ill if I tell you
some of the things I have noted in my long stay
among you. You seem to me to be able to discuss friendship, it is true, better than other people, but your practice of it is by no means worthy
of your preaching. In fact, you are perfectly satisfied when you have eulogized it and shown how
great a good it is, and in time of need you forsake your theories and make your escape somehow

<pb n="v.1.p.196"/>

from the thick of action. Whenever the tragedians mount the stage and show you instances
of the friendship you admire, you cry, "Bravo!"
and applaud; and when they run into danger for
another, most of you are even moved to tears;
but in your own persons you do not venture to
perform any praiseworthy act for another; and
if your friend happens to be in need of anything,
all these sentiments of tragedy instantly take to
themselves wings and fly away like dreams, leaving you like those empty, hollow masks whose
great yawning mouths utter not the slightest
sound. With us the case is reversed; for in
proportion as we are poorer in arguments about
friendship we are richer in its works.

<p>
Come, now, let us do something of this sort, if
it takes your fancy. Let us leave the friends of
old whom you or I could count out of the question; for under that head you would be rich in
them, summoning many credible poets to testify
to the friendship of Achilles and Patroklos, and
the camaraderie of Theseus and Peirithoos and
the others, singing them in metre with the most
beautiful language. But let us select a few from
our contemporaries and tell their exploits-I for
Scythia, you for Greece-and he who is victorious and able to produce the best friends will be
openly the better man, and will proclaim his the
better country, because he has won in a very noble

<pb n="v.1.p.197"/>

and beautiful contest. For my part, I should
vastly prefer losing my right hand for having
been worsted in single combat-that is the Scythian forfeit to being judged inferior to another
man in respect of friendship, and that, too, though
I am a Greek Scythian myself.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="11">

<p><label>Mnesippos</label> It is no joke, Toxaris, to venture
single combat with a man like you for opponent,
equipped with arguments so pointed and so apt.
However, I will not basely leave the whole Greek
cause in the lurch on such short notice and retire
before you; for, seeing that so many Scythians,
as your stories and ancient paintings show, of
which you delivered such a vigorous account a
little while ago, were worsted by two, it would be
a great scandal if all the Greeks, so many nations
and so many cities as they are, should lose their
case by default to you. If this should happen, it
would be fair to cut off, not my right hand, as
your custom is, but my tongue. But shall we
limit ourselves as to the number of friendly exploits, or shall he who is able to mention most
have so much better chance of victory?</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> Oh dear, no. Let us agree that victory shall not lie in the number of exploits; but
if yours are better and more striking than mine,
though the same in number, they will, of course,
wound me more vitally, and I shall give way
sooner before their blows.


<pb n="v.1.p.198"/></p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> Very well. Let us agree how many
are enough. Five apiece, it strikes me.</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> I think so, too. But first declare, and
upon oath, that you will speak the very truth.
Otherwise, to invent this kind of thing is no great
job, and refutation would be difficult; but if you
should take your oath it would be impious not to
believe you.</p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> We will swear, if you do not think
an oath superfluous. But which of our gods do

Or will the God of Friendship do?</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> Certainly; but I will take our national oath when it is my turn to speak.</p>

[His first story celebrates the friendship of
Agathokles of Samos for Deinias of Ephesos.
Deinias was a very rich young man, who was
surrounded by evil companions, and soon wasted
his whole substance in riotous living. Thereupon Agathokles, a man of moderate means and
his friend from childhood, whose good advice
had made him insupportable in the heyday of
Deinias's prosperity, sold the house of his fathers
and handed over the proceeds to his friend. Deinias finally killed two persons in a disgraceful


<pb n="v.1.p.199"/>


embroglio, and was sentenced to transportation
for life to one of the Cyclades. Agathokles accompanied him into exile, tended him through a
long illness, and after his death continued to
live in the island to be near the grave of his
friend.]</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="18">
<p><label>Toxaris</label> I wish you were not on oath, Mnesippos, so that I might be at liberty to disbelieve
your story. By your account this Agathokles is
a true Scythian in friendship. I hope you are
not going to tell of any one else like him.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="19">
<p><label>Mnesippos</label> Then hear about another, Euthydikos of Chalkis. Simylos, the ship-master of
Megara, told me the story, swearing that he had
seen the thing with his own eyes. He said he
was sailing from Italy to Athens early in the autumn, carrying passengers from various places,
and among these were Euthydikos and Damon
his friend, a Chalkidian like himself. They were
of the same age, but Euthydikos was strong and
robust, while Damon was pale and feeble and
seemed to be just recovering from a long illness.
Now, as far as Sicily, Simylos said, the voyage was
prosperous, but when they had passed through
the strait and come out into the Ionian Sea a
great storm fell upon them. It would be useless
to give the details-whelming waves and waterspouts and hail-storms and all the horrors of a
gale. But when they were just off Zakynthos,


<pb n="v.1.p.200"/>



scudding under bare poles, with cordage dangling
overboard to break the force of the sea, Damon
grew sea-sick in such a pitching and tossing, and
leaned over the side of the ship to vomit. Just
then, I suppose, the ship heeled over more violently to that side and the wave receded at the
same time. At all events, he fell head foremost
into the sea with all his clothes on, poor
wretch! which made swimming all the harder.
He straightway gave a choking shriek, hardly
keeping himself on top of the wave.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="20">
<p>
When Euthydikos, who happened to have his clothes off
in bed, heard it, he threw himself into the sea,
got hold of Damon, who had already given upall this could be seen from a distance in the
bright moonlight—and swam along with him,
helping to keep him above water. Those on the
ship were eager to help them and full of pity for
their fate, but they could no nothing, running before such a gale. One thing only was possible,
and that they did; they threw overboard for
them a great number of corks and some puntingpoles, so that they might swim on one of these if
they chanced on it; and finally they threw over
the companion - ladder bodily, which was a large
one.
Consider, now, in Heaven's name, what stronger proof of affection a man could give to his
friend who had fallen by night into such a wild


<pb n="v.1.p.201"/>


sea than to share his death! Pray, call before
your eyes the towering waves, the noise of the
broken water, the boiling foam, the night, the
despair; then that drowning man, hardly keeping his head above water, stretching out his hands
to his comrade, and the comrade leaping to him
instantly and swimming with him, fearful lest Damon should perish before him.
This is the way
to see that in Euthydikos, too, I have described
for you no unworthy friend.</p>

<p><label>Toxaris</label> Were they lost, Mnesippos, or were
they saved by some miracle? I am greatly
alarmed about them.</p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> Be comforted. They were saved,
and they are in Athens at this moment, pursuing
philosophy. Simylos could only tell me what he
saw that night, that the one fell overboard and
the other leaped after him, and that they were
swimming together as far as they could be seen
in the night. But the sequel I learned from Euthydikos's friends. In the first place, they came
upon some of the corks and supported themselves
on these, swimming with difficulty; and later,
towards daybreak, they saw the companion and
swam to it, and, mounted on this, they swam easily the rest of the way to Zakynthos.</p>

After these, who are not bad specimens in my
opinion, hear of a third man no whit worse than

man, had two rich friends, Aretaios of Corinth
and Charixenes of Sikyon. When he died he left
a will, which perhaps may seem absurd to others,
but I am not at all sure that such things do to
you, a man of virtue, who honor friendship, and
are competing for the first prize in it. The will
read: "I bequeath to Aretaios my mother to support and tend in her old age, and to Charixenes
my daughter to give in marriage, with as large a
dowry as he can afford,”—for he had an aged mother and a young daughter just of marriageable age
-"and if, in the mean time, anything happens to
either of the legatees, let the other," said the will,
"take his share." When this will was read, those
who knew the poverty of Eudamidas but were not
aware of the friendship between him and the legatees, turned the matter to a jest, and every one
of them went off laughing and saying that Aretaios
and Charixenes had come into a joyful inheritance if they were to make payment to Eudamidas,
and if they who were living were to leave their
property to a dead man. </p>

later, and Aretaios showed himself the best of
heirs by assuming both his own share and the
other's. He still supports Eudamidas's mother,

ago. Of his estate of five thousand dollars he
gave two thousand with his own daughter and
two thousand with the daughter of his friend, and
deemed it right to celebrate both marriages on
the same day. What do you think of Aretaios,
Toxaris? Does he seem to you to furnish a bad
example of friendship, inheriting such a legacy
and not betraying his friend's bequest? Or shall
our mature decision be to place him as one
among the five ?</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> He, too, is a noble man. But I admire far more the confidence which Eudamidas
placed in his friends. He showed that he, too,
would have done likewise for them, even if the
duty had not been left him by will, and would
have been the first to come as the unappointed
heir of such a legacy.</p>

<p><label>Mnesippos</label> You are right. But I will tell you
of a fourth, Zenothemis, the son of Charmoleos,
from Marseilles. He was pointed out to me in
Italy when I was there on an embassy from our
government, and he was a tall, handsome man,
and apparently rich. There sat beside him in
his carriage a woman who was hideous in every
way. Her right side, moreover, was withered,
and she had lost an eye. She was altogether deformed, a revolting scarecrow. On my expressing wonder that a man so handsome and in the

ure.
driving about with him, the man who had pointed
him out told me what had necessitated the marriage, for he knew all the circumstances perfectly,
being himself a native of Marseilles. He said
that Menekrates, the father of the ill-favored woman, and Zenothemis were friends, and equals in
riches and position. But after a while Menekrates was deprived of his estate, and at the same
time disfranchised by a condemnation of the Six
Hundred for proposing an unconstitutional meas-
This, he said, was the penalty in Marseilles
for making unconstitutional propositions. Now
Menekrates was in great grief, partly because of
the scandal of the condemnation, and partly because from being a rich and honored man he was
now become poor, and of no reputation. But his
greatest trouble was his daughter, who was already
marriageable, being eighteen years old, but of so
ill-favored an aspect that no one, however humbly
born or poor, would have seen fit to take her
without a struggle, even with all the fortune her
father once possessed. She was also said to have
epileptic fits at the waxing of the moon.

But Zenothemis, to whom he was pouring out
these griefs, said to him, “Cheer up, Menekrates.
You are not utterly destitute, nor will your daughter fail to find a bridegroom worthy of her race."
So saying, he took him by the hand, led him to
his house, and presented him with a share of his

great estate. Then he gave orders for a banquet,
and feasted his friends and Menekrates just as if
he had persuaded one of his companions to agree
to marry the girl. When the banquet was over,
and they had poured libations to the gods, he offered a brimming goblet to Menekrates and said:
"Receive a loving-cup from your son-in-law,
for this day I shall marry your daughter, Kydimache. Her dowry I took a long time ago,
twenty-five thousand dollars."
"Out with you!" cried Menekrates. “I hope
neither you nor I is so mad as to forget your
youth and beauty, and see you yoked with this
unsightly, disfigured girl."
But while he was still speaking the other carried
off the bride and presently came back, having
married her. And from that day he has held to
her with great affection, and takes her everywhere
with him, as you see. </p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="26">
<p>Far from being ashamed
of his marriage, he seems to take pride in it,
showing that he despises bodily charms or blemishes and wealth and public opinion, but regards
only his friend Menekrates, who, he thinks, is
none the worse in respect of friendship because
of the condemnation of the Six Hundred. However, Fortune herself has rewarded his deeds in
this way this ugly woman bore him a most
beautiful child, and the other day his father took
him up and carried him into the senate, garlanded


<pb n="v.1.p.206"/>



with the suppliant's twigs and wrapped in black
garments to make him the more pathetic, to plead
for his grandfather. And when the baby laughed
aloud at the senators and clapped his hands, they
warmed to the child and reversed the decision
against Menekrates; and at present he is enfranchised again, thanks to the advocate he employed with the senate.
This, then, is what the man from Marseilles
said Zenothemis had done for his friend, a noble
action, as you see, and such as few Scythians
would do, who are said to be particular in choosing the most beautiful women even for their harems.

We have the fifth case still to consider, and I
should not like to name another man and pass
over Demetrios of Sounion. This Demetrios
sailed to Egypt in company with Antiphilos of
Alopeke. They were friends from childhood,
being of the same age, and they lived together as
students in Egypt, Demetrios pursuing the Cynic
system under that famous sophist from Rhodes,
and Antiphilos studying medicine. It came to
pass after a while that Demetrios went into the
interior to see the Pyramids and the Memnon,
for he had heard of the Pyramids that, in spite of
their height, they throw no shadow, and of the
Memnon that it cries out at the rising of the sun.
Being desirous, then, of seeing the Pyramids and


<pb n="v.1.p.207"/>


hearing the Memnon, he sailed up the Nile, leaving Antiphilos, who dreaded the journey and the
heat, behind.
When Demetrios had been gone six months,</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="28">
<p>
Antiphilos got into a scrape that called for some
very good friend. A slave of his, Syros by name
and a Syrian by nation, joined himself to a gang
of temple-robbers, and, entering the temple of
Anoubis in their company, stole from the god
two golden goblets, a caduceus-this also of gold
some dog-headed gods in silver, and other
booty of the sort, which was all stored with Syros.
They were caught selling some article and imprisoned, and when they were stretched on the wheel
they straightway confessed the whole. Being led
forth, they came to Antiphilos's house and brought
out the booty, which was lodged under a bed in
a dark corner. Both Syros and his master were
immediately bound, Antiphilos being seized in
the middle of his professor's lecture. Nobody
rescued him, but even those who had been his
companions turned away from the man who was
said to have robbed Anoubis, and they counted
it an impiety in themselves if they had ever drunk
or feasted with him. His other slaves, two in
number, cleared everything out of the house, and
ran off.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="29">
<p>
The unhappy Antiphilos had accordingly been
in durance a long time, with the reputation of


<pb n="v.1.p.208"/>



being the most abandoned malefactor in the prison, and the Egyptian jailer, a superstitious man,
considered that he was pleasing and avenging
the god by bearing heavily on Antiphilos. If
he ever defended himself, declaring that he had
never done anything of the sort, he was thought
utterly shameless, and hated the more. Presently
he fell ill and suffered a great deal, naturally, for
he slept on the ground, and at night he could
not stretch out his legs because they were in the
stocks. For by day the collar and a handcuff on
the left-hand were enough, but at night they must
needs bind him completely. Moreover, the illstench of the place, the stifling atmosphere created by so many prisoners confined in the same
room, cramped for space and hardly breathing,
the clang of iron, the scarcity of sleep-all these
things were oppressive and unendurable to a man
who was unused to them, and had had no experience of such a squalid life.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="30">
<p>
When he had begun to despair, and would not
even take food, Demetrios arrived one day, ignorant of all these events. When he learned how
things stood he came running forthwith to the
prison, but he was not admitted then, for it was
evening, and the jailer had locked the door some
time before and gone to sleep, bidding his slaves
to keep guard. But early in the morning he got
in, after many supplications, and, passing along,


<pb n="v.1.p.209"/>


sought Antiphilos for a long time, whose sufferings had made him unrecognizable. Making the
round he examined each of the prisoners, as people do who are searching in the ranks for their
own dead, already disfigured by death. And if
he had not called his name, "Antiphilos Deinomenous!" it would have been some time before
he recognized him, so greatly was he changed by
the horrors he had experienced. But when Antiphilos heard the voice he called in reply, and,
as the other approached, he parted his hair, filthy
and matted with dirt, and drew it back from his
face and showed who he was. Both the friends
fell swooning at the unexpected sight, but presently Demetrios raised himself and Antiphilos
too, and inquired of him exactly how everything
stood. He bade him be of good courage, and,
tearing his cloak in two, he wrapped himself in
one half and the other he gave to Antiphilos,
stripping off the dirty, ragged clouts he wore.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="31">

<p>
After this he kept him company, caring for
him and serving him in every way. He hired
himself to the merchants at the docks from daybreak till noon, and earned a good wage as a
stevedore. Then, leaving his work, he handed
over part of his earnings to the jailer, whom
he thus rendered gentle and peaceable, and the
rest sufficed him for his friend's maintenance.
Through the day he used to stay with Antiphilos,



<pb n="v.1.p.210"/>



cheering him up; but when night fell he would
rest close by the door on a little bed he had
made, with leaves thrown on it.
Some time, then, they passed in this way, Demetrios being free of entry and Antiphilos finding his misfortunes easier to bear. </p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="32">

<p>But after a
certain robber died in the prison, apparently of
poison, a strict guard was instituted, and no permissions whatever were granted to those who
asked to visit the prison. In these circumstances
Demetrios was in despair and grief, and, having
no other means of being near his friend, he went
to the governor and denounced himself as having a share in the undertaking against Anoubis.
At this statement he was forthwith taken off to
prison and brought to Antiphilos, for by many
prayers to the jailer he contrived by his authority to be fastened next to his friend in the same
stocks. It was then he showed most plainly the
tenderness he had for him by disregarding his
own sufferings. And yet he fell ill himself, but
he suffered the less because his mind was bent
on securing rest for his friend. So they bore
their troubles lightly, being together.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="33">
<p>
After a while an event happened, as follows,
which put an end to their misfortunes. One of
the prisoners provided himself with a file from
some source or other, and, with many of the captives for accomplices, sawed off the chain to which


<pb n="v.1.p.211"/>


they were fastened in a row, their wooden collars
being hung on it, and set them all free. They
had no difficulty in killing the guards, who were
few in number, and then scattered in all directions as each best could, most of them being taken
again afterwards. But Demetrios and Antiphilos
stayed on the spot, and even held Syros, who was
in the act of running off. When day broke and
the governor of Egypt heard what had happened,
he despatched men to pursue the runaways; but
sending for Demetrios and his friend he freed
them from their fetters, and praised them for having been the only ones who did not make off.
However, they were not the men to be satisfied
with this dismissal. On the contrary, Demetrios
cried aloud with indignation that it would be a
great injustice if they were to appear to be criminals who had been liberated out of pity or by
way of commendation for not having run away,
and finally he compelled the magistrate to make
a careful examination of the matter. When he
had informed himself of their innocence he dismissed them with eulogies, expressing great admiration for Demetrios in particular, and condoling with them on the punishment which they
had unjustly borne. He made them each a present out of his own pocket, two thousand dollars
to Antiphilos and twice as much to Demetrios.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="34">
<p>
Antiphilos is still living in Egypt, but Demetrios


<pb n="v.1.p.212"/>



left his four thousand dollars also with him and
went off into Egypt among the Bramins, saying
only this to Antiphilos, that his conduct in leaving him so soon would surely be excusable; he
had no need of the money as long as he kept his
present character of being able to do with little,
and Antiphilos had no need of a friend now that
his affairs were going smoothly. Such are Grecian friends, Toxaris, and if you had not already
slandered us by saying that we pride ourselves
on our phrases, I should have related to you the
many noble arguments that Demetrios used in
court, not defending himself at all, but Antiphilos,
actually with tears and supplications, until Syros
was flogged into acquitting them both.</p>

<p>
My story, then, is told of this handful of good
and true friends out of the many that memory first
supplied me with, so I will now descend from
the post of orator and leave the floor to you.
But
you had better be careful to make your Scythians out no worse than these, but a good deal better, unless you want to lose your right hand. You
must speak up like a man, for it would be an
absurd experience for you if, after having praised
Orestes and Pylades like a professional orator,
you should prove an indifferent speaker in behalf
of the Scythians.</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> It is all very well that you spur me
on to speak! Don't you care whether you lose


<pb n="v.1.p.213"/>

your tongue by defeat in the contest? But I will
begin directly without any of your phrase-making; that is not our way in Scythia, particularly
when the deeds speak louder than the words
that tell of them. You need not expect me to
follow you in elaborating the praises of a hero
who married a plain wife without a dowry, or another who gave two thousand dollars as a wedding-present to a friend's daughter, or even one
who offered himself for imprisonment with the
certainty of a speedy release. For all these are
trifles, and not one of them calls for exertion or
courage. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="36">
<p>But I will tell you of many a murder
and war and death for the sake of a friend, to
show that it is childish to compare your case with
ours in Scythia. Still, your feeling is reasonable
enough, and it is natural that you should eulogize
these small matters, for you have no great occasions for displaying friendship, sunk in peace as
you are, just as calm weather furnishes no opportunity to learn a pilot's quality. You need a
storm for that. But with us one war follows on
the heels of another, and we are either riding
against some one else, or retiring before invaders,
or falling to and fighting about pasturage or booty.
In these emergencies, above all others, a man
needs stanch friends. Accordingly, we cement
friendships in the most enduring way, deeming
them our only invincible weapons.

<p>

In the first place, I should like to describe to
you our manner of acquiring friends. We do not
do it over our cups as you do, or because a certain man happens to be a playfellow or a neighbor; but when we see a good man of great ability, we all strive for him, and we think it proper
to win a friend as you do a wife, courting him a
long time and taking all similar measures not to
meet with a disappointment in friendship or figure
as rejected aspirants. And when at length one
has been chosen as his friend, the next step is a
contract and a mighty oath that they will live
together and, if need be, die for one another.
This is the manner of the oath: we cut our fingers and let the blood trickle into a cup and then
we dip our sword-points in it and, desisting from
this at the same moment, we drink. When once
we have done this, nothing can thereafter put us
asunder. Three at most are permitted to enter
into such a contract, since a man with many
friends seems as bad to us as a woman with many
lovers or husbands, and we think his friendship
will no longer be so sure when it is parcelled
among many tendernesses.</p>

<p>
I will begin with the recent adventures of Dandamis. When his friend Amizokes was carried
off as a prisoner of war by the Sauromatians—
but first I will take our national oath for you,
since that was our original agreement.
I swear


<pb n="v.1.p.215"/>


by the Wind and by the Sword, Mnesippos, that
I will tell you nothing false about Scythian
friends.</p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> I did not insist on an oath from
you, Toxaris; but you did well not to swear by
any god.</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> What do you mean? Don't you think
that the Wind and the Sword are gods? Are you,
perhaps, unaware that nothing is greater to men
than life and death? So whenever we swear by
the Wind and the Sword we swear by the Wind
as the source of life and the Sword because it
brings death.</p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> If that is your reason you might
have plenty of other gods like the Sword: the
arrow and the spear and the hemlock and the
noose, and the like.
For this god Death has
many forms, and offers innumerable roads lead
ing his way.</p>


<p><label>Toxaris</label> See now how captious you are! What
a lawyer's trick it is to break in in the midst and
spoil my speech! I held my tongue while you
were talking.</p>


<p><label>Mnesippos</label> I'll not do it again, Toxaris, your
reproof was very just. So go on with confidence
just as if I were not present to hear you. I will
be as silent as that.</p>

<p><label>Toxaris</label> It was the fourth day of friendship
between Dandamis and Amizokes, that is, since


<pb n="v.1.p.216"/>



they had drunk each other's blood, when the
Sauromatians invaded our country with ten thousand horsemen and an army of foot reported to
be three times as many.
Since they fell upon us
when we were not expecting an invasion, they put
all our troops to flight, killing many of the warriors and capturing the survivors, except a few
who were quick enough to swim across the river
to where the other half of our camp was with part
of the wagons. For our leaders had seen fit for
some reason or other to encamp us in that way
on both banks of the Tanais. They next proceeded to drive off our flocks, secure the prisoners, pillage the tents and seize the wagons, most
of which they captured, men and all, and they insulted our wives and concubines under our very
eyes, which nearly maddened us.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="40">
<p>
Now Amizokes was taken prisoner, and as they
were leading him off he called upon his friend by
name, cruelly bound as he was, and reminded him
of the cup
of blood. When Dandamis heard him
he did not hesitate an instant, but swam across to
the enemy with all of us looking on. The Sauromatians, lifting their darts, set on him as if to kill
him, but he shouted the word "Ziris!" When a
man says this word the enemy do not kill him,
but receive him as a messenger about exchange
of prisoners. So he was led to the commander,
and of him he demanded his friend. The commander

<pb n="v.1.p.217"/>

asked for a ransom, saying the prisoner
should not go forth unless he got a great price
for him.<milestone unit="para"/>
"All that I possessed," said Dandamis, "has
been pillaged by you. But if, stripped as I am,
I can in any way pay the price, I am at your service. Command what you will. If you like, take
me in his stead, and use me as you see fit."
"There is no need," said the Sauromatian, "to
keep the whole of you, particularly as you came
saying 'Ziris!' but lay down a part of what you
have, and you may take your friend."
Dandamis asked what he wanted, and the other demanded his eyes. He instantly presented
them to be cut out, and when this had been done,
and the Sauromatians were in possession of the
ransom, he received Amizokes and went away
leaning on him, and together they swam across
and returned to us saved. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="41">
<p>This event put heart
into all the Scythians, and they no longer considered themselves worsted by the Sauromatians,
seeing that the enemy had not carried off our
greatest good, but that our noble disposition was
left to us and our constancy in friendship. And
the same thing frightened the Sauromatians extremely, for they calculated what sort of men we
would be to fight with when we were prepared if
we showed such endurance when we were surprised. So when night came they left most of the


<pb n="v.1.p.218"/>



flocks, and burned the wagons and retreated. But
Amizokes could no longer bear to see at the price
of Dandamis's blindness, so he, too, put out his
own eyes, and they were both permitted a quiet
life by the Scythian commonwealth, and supported
at the public expense with every honor.

What could you tell to match this, Mnesippos,
if I should let you count up ten more in addition
to your five, and not on oath, either, so that you
might add plenty of inventions? And yet I gave
you the bare facts. If you had told a story like
this I know very well how much cleverness you
would have mixed in your tale, what prayers Dandamis offered, and the manner of blinding him,
and what he said and how he went off again, and
how the Scythians received him with blessings,
and the other devices you are wont to employ on
your audience.</p>

But now hear of another man, equally admirable: Belittas, a cousin of this Amizokes. When
he saw his friend Basthes dragged from his horse
by a lion-they happened to be hunting together
—and that the lion had already clutched him and
clung to his throat tearing him with his claws, he
leaped down from his own horse, fell upon the
beast from behind, and dragged him over, diverting his rage to himself. He passed his fingers
between the animal's teeth, and tried his best to
drag Basthes out of his jaws until the lion let


<pb n="v.1.p.219"/>


him go, half dead already, and, turning upon Belittas, grappled with him and slew him too. But
even as he was dying he found time to strike the
lion in the breast with his sword, so that they all
died together, and we buried them, digging two
graves near together, one for the friends and one
opposite for the lion.

<p>
My third case, Mnesippos, shall be the friendship of Makentes, Lonchates, and Arsakomas.
This Arsakomas fell in love with Mazaia, daughter of Leukanor, king of the Bosporians, when he
went as an envoy in the matter of the tribute
which the Bosporians pay us periodically, and
which was then three months overdue. Mazaia
was a tall, beautiful girl, and Arsakomas, seeing
her at dinner, became enamored and fell into a
bad way about her. He had finished the business
of the tribute, and the king had given him his
answer, and was feasting him by way of dismissal. Now it is the custom on the Bosporos for
suitors to propose for girls at dinner, stating the
qualifications which render them desirable parties. On this occasion there happened to be a
great many aspirants at the dinner, kings and
kings' sons, and Tigrapates was there, the monarch of the Lazians, and Adyrmachos, the ruler
of Machlyëne, with many others. Each suitor
is obliged to announce himself and tell why he
has come a-wooing, and then to eat his dinner


<pb n="v.1.p.220"/>



quietly, sitting among the others. But when dinner is over he must ask for a wine-glass and pour
out a libation on the table, and propose for the
girl, setting forth his advantages of birth, or
wealth, or influence, in the most favorable light.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="45">
<p>
In accordance with this custom many had poured
out the libation and made their proposals, counting up their kingdoms and riches; and last of all
Arsakomas called for a glass, and instead of pouring out a libation-for it is not our practice to
pour out our wine, indeed it is held an impiety
towards the god - he emptied the glass at a
draught, and said:
"Your majesty, give me your daughter Mazaia
to hold as my wife. I am a better match than
these others as far as wealth and possessions go."
Leukanor was amazed, for he knew that Arsakomas was poor, and a commoner of the Scythians, and he inquired:
"How much cattle have you, Arsakomas, or
how many wagons? For these are the things you
Scythians are rich in.”
"Nay," said Arsakomas, “I have neither wagons nor herds, but I have two friends so noble
and brave that no other Scythian can match
them."
A shout of laughter rose at these words, and
no account was taken of his offer, for they thought
he was drunk. In the early morning Adyrmachos,


<pb n="v.1.p.221"/>


who had been chosen from the other suitors, made
ready to conduct his bride to the Maiotis among
the Machlyëans. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="46">
<p>But Arsakomas made his way
home and told his friends how he had been insulted by the king, and laughed to scorn at the
dinner because they thought him poor.
"And yet," said he, "I explained to the king
how rich I am in having you, Lonchates and Makentes, and how much better and more secure
your devotion is than the power of the Bosporians.
But while I was going through this he flouted
me and passed me by, and bestowed the right to
lead away the bride on Adyrmachos the Machlyean, because he said he owned ten golden goblets
and eighty four-seated wagons, and any amount
of sheep and cattle. You see how high above
true men he rates store of beeves and superfluous
drinking-cups and heavy wagons. For my part,
my friends, I was doubly wounded, both because
I love Mazaia, and because this public affront cut
me deeply, and I think you were as much wronged
as I.
For a third of the insult belongs to each
of you, at least if we were living as though we
were one man since the day we came together,
and feel pain and pleasure from the same
causes."
"Not only so," rejoined Lonchates, "but each
of us feels the whole of the insult when you are
treated in that way."


<pb n="v.1.p.222"/>


</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="47">
<p>
“The next question,” said Makentes, “is, what
Ishall we do in this case?"
"Let us parcel out the job," said Lonchates.
"I, for my part, promise to bring to Arsakomas
the head of Leukanor, and you must fetch him
the bride."
"Very good," said he. "And you, Arsakomas,
seeing that this is a great business, must stay here
to collect and make ready arms and horses and
other equipment as much as you can get. For it
is not unlikely that an army and a war will be
what we shall need next. You will have no trouble in gathering a goodly following since you are
a true man yourself, and our kinsmen are not
few; but the best way will be to take your seat
on the ox-hide."
These plans were agreed to, and Lonchates
went off, just as he was, direct to the Bosporos,
and Makentes to the Machlyëans, both on horseback. Arsakomas stayed at home and addressed
himself to the young men, armed a force of his
kinsmen, and finally seated himself on the oxhide.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="48">
<p>
The custom of the hide is this: When a man
has received an injury and wishes to revenge
himself on some one, but sees that his unaided
strength will not suffice him, he sacrifices an ox,
cuts the flesh in pieces and boils it, stretches the
hide on the ground and seats himself on it, drawing


<pb n="v.1.p.223"/>


his hands behind his back as if his arms were
tied at the elbow. This is our most urgent form
of supplication. The flesh of the ox lies alongside, and kinsmen, and any one else who will, take
a morsel, and, setting the right foot on the hide,
promise aid according to the ability of each, one
agreeing to furnish five horsemen, found and paid,
another ten, another yet more, another hoplites or
foot-soldiers as many as he is able, and the poorest offering himself alone. Sometimes a great
throng gathers about the hide, and a force of this
sort is most sure to hang together and most irresistible in battle because they are upon oath, for
stepping upon the hide constitutes an oath.
In this way Arsakomas occupied himself, and
about five thousand horsemen joined him, and
hoplites and foot-soldiers to the number of twen.
ty thousand.</p>

Lonchates made his way to the Bosporos incognito, and presented himself before the king,
who was engaged in affairs of state, saying that
he came as a public emissary from Scythia, but
brought also private news of great moment to the
king. When he was bidden speak, he said:
"The Scythians make this public and open demand: that your herdsmen will not cross over
into our plains, but pasture their flocks only to
the end of the rocky ground. And they deny that
the plunderers of whose incursions into your

country you complain were sent out with the
general consent, but declare that each of them
carries on his robbery for his own private advantage; and that if one of them should be caught
you are authorized to punish him. This is their
communication. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="50">
<p>But I will inform you on my
own account of a great expedition that is coming
against you under Arsakomas, son of Mariantes,
who was recently an envoy to your court. I believe your rejection of him as a suitor for your
daughter is the cause of his enmity. He has been
sitting on the ox-hide this week past and has collected a considerable force."
"I had heard myself," rejoined Leukanor,
"that a force was being gathered by some one's
ox-hide, but I did not know that it was collected
against us, or that Arsakomas was at the head of it."

"It is against you, however, that it is being
prepared," said Lonchates. But Arsakomas is
an enemy of mine, and he takes it ill that I am
honored before him by the elders and am thought
the better man in all respects. And if you should
promise me your other daughter, Barketis-since
I am no unworthy match in other respects-I will
come before long and bring you his head.
"I promise," said the king, growing extremely
frightened, for he knew the reason Arsakomas
had for being angry about the marriage, and he
always trembled at the Scythians anyhow.


<pb n="v.1.p.225"/>


"Swear, then," said Lonchates, "in very truth
to keep your agreement and not to repudiate it."
At this point, and just as the king had lifted
his hand to heaven, intending to swear, Lonchates said,
"Not here, for some of the by-standers might
suspect the matter of our oath. But let us go
into the temple of Ares here and shut the doors
and take our oaths so that nobody can hear them.
For if Arsakomas should get wind of this I am
afraid he would offer me up ås a sacrifice before
battle, since he is already surrounded by no small
force."
"Very well," said the king. Then, turning to
his attendants," Remove to a distance, and let
no one be found in the temple unless I call him."
When they had entered and the body-guard
had withdrawn, Lonchates drew his sword, grasped the king's mouth with his other hand to prevent his crying out, and smote him in the breast.
Then he cut off his head and went out with it
under his cloak, pretending to speak with the
king as he went, and saying that he would be
back directly, as if Leukanor had sent him on
some errand.
When he had thus made his way to the place
where he had left his horse tied, he mounted and
spurred off to Scythia. There was no pursuit,
for it was a long time before the Bosporians



<pb n="v.1.p.226"/>



found out what had happened, and when they
did find it out they fell to quarrelling about the
succession. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="51">
<p>These, then, were the exploits of
Lonchates, done in fulfilling his promise to Arsakomas by bringing the head of Leukanor.
Makentes, on his part, arrived among the Machlyëans, having heard on the road what had
happened at the Bosporus. Thus he was the
first to announce to them the murder of the king,
and he added:
"The state, Adyrmachos, summons you to the
throne because you are his son-in-law. So do
you ride first and seize the empire, appearing on
the scene while matters are in disorder. Let the
young lady follow after you with chariots, for you
will the more easily conciliate the Bosporian mob
if they see the daughter of Leukanor. I am an
Alanian and related to the girl on the mother's
side, for it was from our family that Leukanor
chose his wife, Masteira. And now I am come
to you from Masteira's brothers in Alania, who
bid you ride to the Bosporos as quickly as you
may, and not permit the empire to pass into the
hands of Eubiotos, a bastard brother of Leukanor, who has always been a friend of the Scythians and detested by the Alanians."
This speech Makentes delivered, wearing the
dress of the Alanians and speaking their language, for on these points the Scythians and


<pb n="v.1.p.227"/>


Alanians agree with this one exception, that the
Alanians do not wear their hair very long, as the
Scythians do. But in this respect, too, Makentes
had likened himself to an Alanian by cutting his
hair as much short of the Scythian length as an
Alanian's would probably be. So by these means
he got credence as a relative of Masteira and
Mazaia.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="52">
<p>
"And now, Adyrmachos," said he, "I am ready
to ride with you to the Bosporos if you like, or,
if need be, to stay behind and escort the young
lady."
"That is what I should prefer," said Adyrmachos, "to have you escort Mazaia. For if
you go with us to the Bosporos we should only
be one horseman the more, but if you should
escort my wife for me you would be worth a multitude."
This was done, and Adyrmachos rode off, having handed over his maid-wife Mazaia to Makentes. He, on his part, escorted her in her
chariot during the day, but when night fell he
set her upon a horse-for he had provided that
one horseman beside himself should accompany
them-and, leaping on his own, he no longer rode
by the Maiotis, but turned off inland, keeping
the Mitraian mountains on his right. He let the
the girl rest now and then, and on the third day
crossed the Machlyëan border into Scythia. His

horse, when he stopped galloping, stood still for
a moment, and then fell dead.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="53">
<p>
Makentes handed over Mazaia to Arsakomas,
saying, "Receive the fulfilment of my promise
also." He was stunned by the unexpected vision,
and strove to express his thanks, but Makentes
said, "Stop trying to make me out a different
person from yourself. To thank me for what I
have done is much as if my left-hand should acknowledge its obligation to my right because it
had been tended when it was wounded, and tenderly cared for when it was tired. So it would
be an absurdity in us, too, if we who have joined
our fortunes this long time, and as nearly as possible made ourselves into one man, should still
think it a great thing if a part of us does something for the good of the whole body. For it is
for his own good that he does it, seeing he is part
of the benefitted whole." Thus did Makentes
meet Arsakomas's thanks.</p>

Adyrmachos, when he heard of the fraud, did
not continue his journey to the Bosporos, for
Eubiotos was already installed in office, having
been summoned from Sauromatia, where he was
sojourning. He returned home, collected a great
army, and marched through the hill-country upon
Scythia. Soon after, Eubiotos, too, made an attack, leading a rabble of Greeks and picked
troops from Alania and Sauromatia, forty thousand

<pb n="v.1.p.229"/>

strong. He and Adyrmachos joined forces,
thus forming an army of ninety thousand men, of
whom a third were mounted archers. But wefor I, too, had a share in their rising, and contributed a hundred found horsemen on the occasion
of the ox-hide-assembled to the number of nearly thirty thousand, counting the horsemen, and
awaited the onset. Arsakomas was in command.
When we saw them coming we advanced to
meet them, sending the cavalry against them first.
When the battle had been fiercely waged a long
time our side began to give in. Our phalanx was
gradually broken into, and finally the whole Scythian army was cut in two, and one part retired,
not distinctly worsted, however; indeed, their
flight looked like an orderly retreat, and even the
Alanians did not dare to pursue them far. But
the Machlyeans and Alanians surrounded the other half, which was the smaller, and cut them down
in every direction with a generous discharge of
arrows and darts, so that the surrounded were
almost exhausted, and most of them were already
throwing down their arms. </p>

<p>As it happened, both
Lonchates and Makentes were in this division,
and they had both been wounded already through
their hardihood-Lonchates in the thigh with the
butt-end of a lance, and Makentes in the head
with an axe, and in the shoulder with the shaft
of a pike.


<pb n="v.1.p.230"/>



When Arsakomas, who was with us in the other division, perceived this, he felt that it would
be a shocking thing if he were to go off and leave
his friends behind, so he clapped spurs to his
horse, and, raising a shout, rode through the enemy, waving his sword on high, so that the Machlyëans could not withstand the rush of his
courage, but fell apart and gave way to him to
pass through. When he had recovered his friends
and heartened up the others, he darted upon
Adyrmachos, and, striking him in the neck with
his sword, cleft him to the belt. At his fall the
whole force of the Machyleans fell into disorder,
and then the Alanians and the Greeks followed
suit, so that we began to have the advantage,
and we should have gone on killing for a long
time if night had not robbed us of the business.
On the following day suppliants came from
the enemy asking for peace, the Bosporians promising to pay double their tribute, the Machlyëans
saying that they would give hostages, and the
Alanians agreeing to subdue for us as indemnity
for that invasion, the Sindianoi, who had been at
feud with us for a long time. On these terms we
made a treaty, as had been agreed upon much
earlier by Arsakomas and Lonchates, and peace
was made under the direction of these men.
Such deeds, Mnesippos, the Scythians dare do
for friends.

<p>But hear what
services I myself received from a friend named
Sisinnes. When I left home and went to Athens,
through my desire for a Greek education, I put
in at Amastris, on the Pontos; for ships from
Scythia call there, the city being not far from
Karambis. Sisinnes accompanied me, my friend
from childhood. We spied a sort of lodginghouse near the harbor, and, removing our luggage
into it from the ship, we went out to stroll in the
market-lace, suspecting no evil. But in the
mean time some thieves forced the bolt and carried off everything, leaving us not even enough to


<pb n="v.1.p.232"/>



get through the day with.
Now when we came
home and found what had happened, we felt it
would not do to accuse the neighbors, for there
were many of them, or the landlord, for we were
afraid most people would think us sharpers if we
said that some one had robbed us of fifteen hundred dollars, a great deal of clothing, some rugs,
and everything else we had. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="58">
<p>We considered our
circumstances and what we should do, utterly without resources in a foreign country, and my opinion
was that we had better thrust our swords between
our ribs then and there and die, rather than submit to be shamefully destroyed by hunger and
thirst. But Sisinnes tried to encourage me, and
implored me to do nothing of the sort, for he had
a plan by which we should get food enough. And
for the nonce he took to carrying wood from the
harbor, and returned with provisions bought with
his wages. But early next morning, as he was
walking about the market-place, he saw a kind
of procession, as he said, of noble and beautiful
youths. They were enlisted to fight in single
combat for pay, and the contest was to come off
in three days. He made full inquiries about
them, and then came to me and said, "Don't call
yourself poor any longer, Toxaris, for in three days
I shall prove you rich."</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg044.perseus-eng5:" n="59">
<p>
That was all he told me, and we managed to
eke out a wretched existence in the interval.


<pb n="v.1.p.233"/>


When the games were about to begin we also
were among the spectators, for Sisinnes dragged
me out, persuading me that it would be a pleasure to see the wonderful Greek games, and
brought me to the theatre. Sitting there we first
saw wild beasts infuriated with darts and then
chased by dogs, or let loose upon bound men,
who, we concluded, were criminals. Then the
single fighters entered, and the herald, bringing
forward a well-grown youth, said that whoever
wished to fight him was to come into the arena
and get two thousand dollars, the wages for fighting. At this Sisinnes rose, and, leaping into the
arena, offered to fight, and asked for weapons.
When he received the money he brought it to
me and gave it into my hands. "If I should
win, Toxaris," he said, "we will go off together
with plenty of money, but if I fall, bury me and
go back to Scythia." Thereupon I cried out,</p>

<p> but
he took the armor and put it all on except the
helmet. This he did not wear, but fought bareheaded. The first thing that happened was that
he was wounded, cut under the knee with a
curved sword, so that the blood ran plentifully.
I was already dead in advance with fear. But,
watching his adversary, who came on too boldly,
he struck him on the breast and drove home so
that he went down in an instant between Sisinnes's feet.


<pb n="v.1.p.234"/>



Sisinnes was exhausted himself by his wound,
so that he sat down on the body and almost gave
up his own ghost. But I ran forward, raised
him up and comforted him, and when they had
dismissed him as already the victor I lifted him
and carried him home. After he had been nursed
a long time he survived, it is true, and lives to this
day in Scythia, married to my sister. But, nevertheless, he is lame from his wound. This, Mnesippos, took place neither in Machlyëne nor in
Alania, so as to be unsupported by evidence and
open to disbelief, but many of the folk of Amastris are at hand who remember the contest of
Sisinnes.</p>

When I have told you as my fifth case the
deeds of Abauchas I will stop. This Abauchas
once came into a city of the Borysthenites, bringing with him his wife, whom he loved tenderly,
and two small children, one of them a baby at
the breast and the other a girl seven years old.
A friend of his, Gyndanes, journeyed in company
with him, and he, moreover, was suffering from a
wound he got from robbers who had waylaid
them on the road. For in fighting them he got a
thrust in the thigh, so that he could not even
stand for pain. As they were asleep at night—
they happened to be lodging in an upper story—a
great fire broke out, all means of exit were cut
off, and the flames surrounded the house on every


<pb n="v.1.p.235"/>

side. Thereupon Abauchas awoke, and he left
his weeping child behind and shook off his wife,
who clung to him, calling to her to save herself;
but he lifted his friend and made his way down,
and was in time to get out through part of the
house not yet entirely seized by the fire. His wife
followed, carrying the baby, and bidding the little
girl come after; but the woman was half-burnt and
let the baby fall from her arm, and barely leaped
through the flame with the little girl, who also had
a narrow escape from death.
When it was afterwards made a reproach to
Abauchas that he had deserted his wife and
children to bring Gyndanes out, he would say,
"It is an easy matter for me to have more children, and it is impossible to know whether they
will be good or not; but it would take me a long
time to find another such friend as Gyndanes,
who has given me great proof of his affection."</p>

possession, why should not we too agree between
ourselves that we are friends now and will be forever, and acquiesce in a common victory, carrying
off the greatest prizes—instead of one tongue or
one right-hand, each gaining two and four eyes
besides, and four feet, and a double allowance of
everything? For when two or three friends join.
they form something like the painters' picture of
