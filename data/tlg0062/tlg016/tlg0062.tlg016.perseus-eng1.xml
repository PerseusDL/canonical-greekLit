<head>The Downward Journey, or the Tyrant<note><p>A scene in the realm of Hades, showing that cobblers fare
better there than kings. The lower world is depicted also in
the Menippus and in the Dialogues of the Dead. All these
pleces were deeply influenced by Cynic satire and in particular by the Necyia of Menippus. Helm maintains that the
Downward Journey is based on a couple of scenes in the
Necyia which Lucian left unused in writing his Menippus
and subsequently worked up into a separate dialogue, prefixing an introduction of his own; but there is hardly
enough evidence to make this theory plausible, lect alone
incontestable.</p>
<p>The part played by the Fates is unusual. Instead of
Spinning destinies up aloft as in the Charon, two of them are
given a share in the convoying of souls to the underworld,Atropos turning them over to Hermes and C lotho presiding
over their reception at the ferry. Clotho’s function thus in
great measure duplicates that assigned to Aeacus.</p></note></head>

<label>CHARON</label>
Well, Clotho, we have had this boat all ship-shape
and thoroughly ready to sail for some time. The
water is baled out, the mast is set up, the sail is
hoisted in stops and each of the oars has a lanyard to
it, so that as far as I am concerned there is nothing
to hinder our getting up anchor and sailing. But
Hermes is behind hand; he should have been here
long ago. There is not a passenger aboard the ferryboat, as you see, when she might have made three
trips to-day by this time, and here it is almost dusk
and I haven’t earned even an obol yet. Besides,
Pluto will surely think I am taking it easy all this
time, when really someone else is to blame. Our
honourable guide of souls<note n="v.2.p.3.n.1">Hermes.</note> has had a drink of Lethewater up there if ever a man did, and so has forgotten
to come back to us: he is either wrestling a fall with
the boys or playing a tune on the lyre or making
speeches to show off his command of piflle, or maybe
the gentleman is even playing sneak-thief, for that is
one of his accomplishments also. Anyhow, he takes

<pb n="v.2.p.5"/>

liberties with us as if he were free, when really
he is half ours.<note n="v.2.p.5.n.1">Like a slave in the upper world, Charon identifies himself with his master Pluto.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
But, Charon, how do you know that he hasn’t
found something to keep him busy? Zeus may have
wanted to make more use of him than usual in
affairs up above. He too is his master.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Yes, Clotho, but he has no right to go too far in
playing the master over joint property, for we
on our part have never kept Hermes back when
he had to go. No, I know the reason: here with
us there is nothing but asphodel and libations and
funeral-cakes and offerings to the dead, and all else
is misty, murky darkness ; in heaven, however, it is
all bright, and there is ambrosia in plenty and nectar
without stint, so it is likely that he finds it more
pleasant to tarry there. And when he leaves us he
flies up as if he were escaping from jail, but when it
is time to come down he comes with reluctance, at
the last moment, slowly and afoot.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Don’t be angry any longer, Charon; here he is
close by, you see, bringing us a lot of people, or I
should say waving them along with his wand, all in
a huddle, like a herd of goats. But what’s this?
There is a man in fetters among them and another
who is laughing, I see, and one fellow with a wallet
over his shoulder and a club in his hand, who has a
piercing eye and hurries the others along. Don’t
you see, too, that Hermes himself is dripping with
sweat and dusty-footed and panting? In fact, he is

<pb n="v.2.p.7"/>

gasping for breath. What’s all this, Hermes?
What’s the excitement? You seem to be in a stew,
you know.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Why, Clotho, this miserable sinner ran away and I
chased him, and so almost failed to make your boat
to-day, that’s all!
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Who is he, and what was his object in trying to
run away?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
That’s easy to see—he preferred to live! He isa
king or a tyrant, to judge from his lamentations and
the wailing that he makes, in which he makes out
that he has had great happiness taken away from
him.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
So the poor fool tried to run away, thinking that
he could live longer, when the thread of life apportioned to him had already run short?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Tried to run away, do you say? Why, if this
splendid fellow, the one with the stick, had not
helped me and we had not caught and bound him, he
would have got clean away from us. You see, from
the moment Atropos turned him over to me he kept
straining and pulling back every inch of the way,
and as he braced his feet on the ground he was by
no means easy to lead; sometimes, too, he would
beg and entreat, wanting to be let go for a little
while and promising a heavy bribe. Of course I did
not let him go, for I saw that what he was after
was impossible. But when we were right by the

<pb n="v.2.p.9"/>

entrance, while I was counting the dead for Aeacus<note n="v.2.p.9.n.1">Aeacus is the “collector of customs” (Charon 2). The idea was probably suggested by the Froys of Aristophanes, in which he figures as Pluto’s janitor (464).</note>
as usual and he was comparing them with the tally
sent him by your sister, he gave us the slip somehow
or other, curse him, and made off. Consequently we
were one dead man short in the reckoning, and
Aeacus raised his eyebrows and said : “Don’t be too
promiscuous, Hermes, in plying your thievery; be
content with your pranks in Heaven. The accounts
of the dead are carefully kept and cannot be falsified.
The tally has a thousand and four marked on it, as
you see, and you come to me with one less. You
aren’t going to say that Atropos cheated you in the
reckoning ?” What he said made me blush, but I
speedily recalled what had happened on the way,
and when, after glancing about me, I did not see
this fellow anywhere, I perceived that he had escaped
and pursued with all the speed I could muster along
the road leading toward the light. My good friend
here followed me of his own free will, and by running
as if in a match we caught him just at Taenarus:<note n="v.2.p.9.n.2">A promontory in Laconia where the ancients located one of the entrances to Hades ; now Cape Matapan.</note>
that was all he lacked of escaping.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<label>CLOTHO</label>
And we, Charon, were condemning Hermes for
neglecting his duty, indeed !
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Well, why do we keep dilly-dallying as though we
had not had delay enough already.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Right ; let them get aboard. I will hold the book
and sit by the gangway as usual, and as each of them

<pb n="v.2.p.11"/>

comes aboard I will see who he is, where he comes
from, and how he met his death ; you receive them,
and as you do so, pack and stow them. LTlermes,
heave these babies aboard first, for what in the world
can they have to say to me?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here you are, ferryman, three hundred of them,
including those that were abandoned.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
I say, what a rich haul! It’s green-grape dead
you have brought us.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Clotho, do you want us to get the unmourned
aboard next ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
You mean the old people? Yes, for why should I
bother now to investigate what happened before the
food?<note n="v.2.p.11.n.1">Literally, "before Euclid,” the Athenian archon of 403 B.C., the year in which the democracy was restored and the misdeeds of the oligarchy obliterated by a general amnesty.</note> All of you who are over sixty go in now.
What’s this? They don’t heed me, for their ears are
stopped with years. You will probably have to pick
them up and carry them in, too.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here you are again, three hundred and _ninetyeight, all tender and ripe and harvested in season.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Good Lord, yes! They’re all raisins now !

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Bring in the wounded next, Hermes. (To the
DEAD) First tell me what deaths brought you

<pb n="v.2.p.13"/>


here—but no, I myself will refer to my papers and
pass you. Eighty-four should have died in battle
yesterday in Media, among them Gobares, the son of
Oxyartas.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here they are!
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Seven committed suicide for love, among them the
philosopher Theagenes for the courtesan from
Megara.<note n="v.2.p.13.n.1">This man can hardly be other than the Cynic of Patras mentioned in The Passing of Peregrinus, who died in the teign of Marcus Aurelius. To be sure, Galen says he was killed by his doctor (x, p. 909), but he may well have been alive when Lucian wrote this.</note>
<label>HERMES</label>
Right here beside you.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Where are the men who killed each other fighting
for the throne?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here they stand.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
And the man who was murdered by his wife and
her lover ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
There beside you.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Now bring in the output of the courts, I mean
those who died by the scourge and the cross. And
where are the sixteen who were killed by pirates,
Hermes ?

<pb n="v.2.p.15"/>

<label>HERMES</label>
Here they are, these wounded men whom you see.
Do you want me to bring in all the women
together ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
By all means, and also those lost at sea, for they
died in the same way. And those who died of the
fever, bring them in together, too, and their doctor
Agathocles along with them.

Where is the philosopher Cyniscus, who was to die from eating the
dinner of Hecate and the lustral eggs and a raw
squid besides ?<note n="v.2.p.15.n.1">The dinner of Hecate (mentioned also in Dialogues of the Dead, 1) was a purificatory offering made at cross-roads and,to judge from Aristophanes (Plutus 594), very well received by the poor. For the use of eggs in purification see Ovid, Ars Amat. ii. 329; Juv. vi. 517. The raw squid is mentioned because Diogenes is said to have died from eating one (Diog. Laert. 156 ap; cf. Philosophers for Sale, 10).</note>
<label>CYNISCUS</label>
Ihave been standing at your elbow a long time,
kind Clotho. What have I done that you should leave
me on earth so long? Why, you nearly ran off your
whole spindle for me! In spite of that, I have often
tried to cut the thread and come, but somehow or
other it could not be broken.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
I left you behind to observe and prescribe for
the sins of man. But get aboard, and good luck to
you. :
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
No, by Heaven, not till we have put this man in
fetters aboard. I am afraid he may come it over you
with his entreaties.

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<label>CLOTHO</label>
Come, let’s see who he is.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Megapenthes,<note n="v.2.p.17.n.1">“Great woe.”</note> son of Lacydes, a tyrant.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Aboard with you !
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Oh no, good lady Clotho! Do let me go back to
earth for a little while. Then [ll come of my own
accord, you will find, without being summoned by
anyone.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why is it that you want to go back ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Let me finish my house first, for the building has
been left half-done.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Nonsense! Come, get aboard.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
It’s not much time that I ask for, Lady of Destiny ;
let me stay just this one day, till I can give my wife
directions about my money—the place where I kept
my great treasure buried.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
It is settled ; you can’t be permitted.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Then is all that gold to be lost?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
No, it will not be lost. Be easy on that score
your cousin Megacles will get it.
<pb n="v.2.p.19"/>

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
What an outrage! My enemy, whom I was too
easy-going to put to death before I died ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
The very man ; and he will outlive you forty years
and a little more, taking over your concubines and
your clothing and all your plate.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
You are unjust, Clotho, to bestow my property on
my worst enemies.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why, did not it formerly belong to Cydimachus,
and did not you take it over after killing him and
slaughtering his children upon him while the breath
was still in his body ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But it was mine now.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Well, the term of your ownership has now expired.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Listen, Clotho, to something that I have to say to
you in private, with nobody else listening. (Yo the
others.) You people stand aside a moment. (Yo ctoruo)
If you let me run away, I promise to give you a
thousand talents of coined gold to-day.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What, you ridiculous creature, have you gold and
talents still on the brain ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
And I'll give you also, if you wish, the two winebowls that I got when I put Cleocritus to death ;
they are of refined gold and weigh a hundred talents
each.

<pb n="v.2.p.21"/>


<label>CLOTHO</label>
Hale him off: it seems that he won’t go aboard
willingly.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
I call you all to witness, the town wall and the
docks remain unfinished. I could have finished them
if I had lived only five days longer.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Never mind ; someone else will build the wall.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But this request at all events is reasonable.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What request ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
To live only long enough to subdue the Pisidians
and subject the Lydians to tribute, and to build
myself a huge mausoleum and inscribe on it all the
great military exploits of my life.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why, man, you are no longer asking for this one
day, but for a stay of nearly twenty years !

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But I tell you I am ready to give bail for my
speedy return. If you wish, I’ll even surrender you
my beloved as a substitute for myself.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Vile wretch! Have not you often prayed that he
night outlast you on earth?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
That was long ago, but now I perceive whawi is for
the best.

<pb n="v.2.p.23"/>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
He too will soon be here, you'll find, slain by the
new ruler.

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Well, at all events don't refuse me this, Lady of
Destiny. ,
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
I want to know how things will turn out after my
death.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Listen, for it will vex you all the more to know.
Midas, your slave, will have your wife ; indeed, he
has been her lover a long time.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Curse him, I set him free at her request !
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Your daughter will be enrolled among the concubines of the present tyrant, and the busts and
statues which the city long ago set up in your
honour will all be pulled down and will make everyone who looks at them laugh.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Tell meé, will none of my friends get angry at these
doings ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why, what friend did you have, and how did you
make him? Don’t you know that all those who
bowed the knee and praised your every word and
deed did so either from hope or from fear, being

<pb n="v.2.p.25"/>

friends of your power, not of you, and keeping their
eyes on the main chance?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But as they poured their libations at our drinking
parties they used to pray at the top of their voices
that many blessings might descend upon me, saying
every one of them that he was ready to die for me if
so might be ; in a word, they swore by me.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Consequently, you died after dining with one of
them yesterday : it was that last drink he gave you
that sent you down here.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Then that is why I noticed a bitter taste. But
what was his object in doing it?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
You are asking me many questions when you ought
to get aboard.

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
There is one thing that sticks in my throat above
all, Clotho, and on account of it I longed to slip
back again to the light of day, if only for a
moment.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What is that? It must be something tremendous.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
As soon as Cario, my valet, saw that I was dead,
toward evening he came into the room where I lay,
having nothing to do, for nobody was doing anything,
not even guarding me, and brought in my mistress
Glycerium; they had been on good terms a long time,

<pb n="v.2.p.27"/>

Isuppose. Shutting the door, he began to make free
with her as though nobody was in the room, and
then, when he had enough of it, he gazed at me and
said: “You wretched little shrimp, you often gave
me beatings when I was not at fault.” With that he
pulled my hair and hit me in the face, and finally,
after clearing his throat raucously and spitting on
me, went away saying: “Off with you to the place
of the wicked!” I was aflame with rage, but could
not do a thing to him, for I was already stiff and
cold. And as for the wretched wench, when she
heard people approaching she smeared her eyes with
spittle as if she had been crying over me and
went away weeping and calling my name. If I
should catch them—

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Stop threatening and get aboard; it is already
time for you to make your appearance in court.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
And who will dare to pass judgement on a tyrant?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
On a tyrant, no one, but on a dead man,
Rhadamanthus. You shall soon see him impose on
every one of you the sentence that is just and fits the
case. No more delay now!
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Make me even a common man, Lady of Destiny,
one of the poor people; make me evenaslave instead
of the king that once I was. Only let me come to
life again!

<pb n="v.2.p.29"/>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Where is the man with the club? You take hold
of him too, Hermes, and pull him in by the leg, for
he won’t go aboard willingly.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Come along now, runaway. (Zo cuanon.) Take
this fellow, ferryman, and see here—mind you make
sure—
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
No fear! he shall be lashed to the mast.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But I ought to sit on the quarter-deck !
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
For what reason ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Because I was a tyrant, God knows, and had a
regiment of guardsmen.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Then wasn’t Cario justified in pulling your hair, if
you were such a lout? But you'll get small joy of
your tyranny if I give you a taste of my club!
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
What, will a Cyniscus make bold to shake his staff
at me? Did I not come within an ace of tricing you
up to a cross the other day because you were too
free-spoken and sharp-tongued and censorious?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
That is why you yourself will stay triced up to
the mast.

And who are you ?

So you are aggrieved at having to wait? Don’t

if we will let him go for a little while? Indeed,
it surprises me that you are not equally glad of the
delay.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Listen, kind. Lady of Destiny; I have no great
liking for such gifts as the famous one of the
Cyclops,—to be promised “T’]l eat Noman last of all.”<note n="v.2.p.31.n.1">Odyssey 9, 369.</note>
In truth, be it first, be it last, the same teeth are in
waiting. Besides, my position is not like that of the
rich; our lives are poles apart, as the saying goes.
Take the tyrant, considered fortunate his whole life
long, feared and admired by everybody ; when he
came to leave all his gold and silver and clothing and
horses and dinners and handsome favourites and
beautiful women, no wonder he was distressed and
took it hard to be dragged away from them. Somehow or other the soul is limed, as it were, to things
like these and will not come away readily because
it has been cleaving to them long; indeed, the ties
with which such men have the misfortune to be
bound are like unbreakable fetters. Even if they
are haled away by force, they lament and entreat,
you may be sure, and although they are bold in
everything else, they prove to be cowardly in
the face of this journey to Hades. At any rate,
they turn back and, like unsuccessful lovers, want to

<pb n="v.2.p.33"/>

gaze, even from afar, at things in the world of light.
That is what yonder poor fool did, who not only ran
away on the road but heaped you with entreaties
when he got here.

But as for me, having nothing at
stake in life, neither farm nor tenement nor gold
nor gear nor reputation nor statues, of course I was
in marching order, and when Atropos did but sign to
me I gladly flung away my knife and my leather (I
was working on a sandal) and sprang up at once and
followed her, barefooted as I was and without even
washing off the blacking. In fact, I led the way,
with my eyes to the fore, since there was nothing in
the rear to turn me about and call me back. And
by Heaven I see already that everything is splendid
here with you, for that all should have equal rank
and nobody be any better than his neighbour is
more than pleasant, to me at least. And I infer that
there is no dunning of debtors here and no paying of
taxes, and above all no freezing in winter or falling
ill or being thrashed by men of greater consequence.
All are at peace, and the tables are turned, for we
paupers laugh while the rich are distressed and
lament.

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Indeed, I noticed some time ago that you were
laughing, Micyllus. What was it in particular that
made you laugh ?
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Listen, goddess whom I honour most. As I lived
next door to Sir Tyrant on earth, I used to see quite
distinctly what went on at his house, and I then
thought him a very god; for I held him happy when
I saw the splendour of his purple, the number of his

<pb n="v.2.p.35"/>

attendants, his plate, his jewelled goblets, and his
couches with legs of silver; besides, the savour
of the dishes prepared for his dinner drove me to
distraction. Therefore he appeared to me a superman, thrice-blessed, better looking and a full royal
eubit taller than almost anyone else; for he
was uplifted by his good fortune, walked with a
majestic gait, carried his head high and dazzled all
he met. But when he was dead, not only did he cut
an utterly ridiculous figure in my eyes on being
stripped of his pomp, but I laughed at myself even
more than at him because I had marvelled at such a
worthless creature, inferring his happiness from the
savour of his kitchen and counting him lucky because
of his purple derived from the blood of mussels in
the Laconian Sea.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg016.perseus-eng1" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

And he was not the only one
that I laughed at. When I saw the usurer Gnipho
groaning and regretting that he had not enjoyed his
money but had died without sampling it, abandoning
his property to that wastrel Rhodochares, who was
nextof kin to him and had the first claim on the estate
according to law, I could not control my laughter,
: especially when I called to mind how pale and
unkempt he always was, with a forehead full of
worries, feeling his riches only with the fingers with
which he reckoned up thousands and tens of thousands ashe gathered in, little by little, what was soon
to be poured out by that lucky dog Rhodochares.
But why not gonow? We can finish our laughing
during: the sail as we see them crying.

Yes, by all means, if you know any of the sailors’

But that is not enough, Cyniscus: strip yourself,

Here I am naked, so seek out the marks you

<p><label>RHADAMANTHUS</label>
The man is altogether free from marks, except for
these three or four, very faint and uncertain. But
what is this? There are many traces and indications

erased, or rather, effaced. How is that, Cyniscus,

<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I will tell you. For a long time I was a wicked
man through ignorance and earned many marks
thereby ; but no sooner had I begun to be a philosopher than I gradually washed away all the scars
from my soul.

that the cursed scoundrel did while he was a private
citizen I intend to pass over; but when he had
leagued himself with the boldest men and had got
together a bodyguard, and so had set himself over the
city and had become tyrant, he not only put to
death more than ten thousand people without a
hearing but confiscated their properties in each case ;
and after he had made himself extremely rich, he
did not leave a single form of excess untried,
but practised every sort of savagery and high-handedness upon his miserable fellow-citizens, ravishing
maids, corrupting boys, and running amuck in every
way among his subjects. And for his superciliousness,
his pride, and his haughtiness toward all he met you
never could exact from him a fitting penalty. It
would have been less dangerous to look steadily at
the sun than at this man. Then, too, in the matter
of punishments who could describe his cruel inventiveness? Why, he did not even let his closest kin
alone! And that all this is not mere empty calumny
against him you will soon find out if you summon
up the men he murdered—but no, they are here
unsummoned, as you see, and press about him and
throttle him. All these men, Rhadamanthus, have
met their death at the scoundrel’s hands, some of
them entrapped in plots because of pretty wives,
others because they were angry on account of sons
outrageously kidnapped, others because they were
rich, and others because they were honest and decent
