And find thy comfort in a faithful fool.</p>

A boon the lightning-eyed Tritonia asks:
Speak, rend the veil thy secret thought that masks;
Reveal what care thy mind within thee gnaws,
Blanches thy cheek, and this deep moaning draws,</p>

Tragedy holds no misery or woe,
But our divinest essence soon shall taste.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> My dear, a discussion somehow arose yesterday between Timocles the Stoic and Damis the Epicurean; there was a numerous and respectable audience (which particularly annoyed me), and they had an argument on the subject of Providence. Damis questioned the existence of the Gods, and utterly denied their interest in or government of events, while Timocles, good man, did his best to champion our cause. A great crowd gathered round; but no conclusion was reached. They broke up with an understanding that the inquiry should be completed another day; and now they are all agog to see which will win and prove his case. You all see how parlous and precarious is our position, depending on a single mortal. These are the alternatives for us: to be dismissed as mere empty names, or
(if Timocles prevails) to enjoy our customary honours.

<p><label>Heracles</label> This is really a serious matter; your ranting was not so uncalled-for, Zeus.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> You fancied me thinking of some Danaé or Antiope; and this was the dread reality. Now, Hermes, Hera, Athene, what is our course? We await your contribution to our plans.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> My opinion is that an assembly be summoned and the community taken into counsel.</p>

<p><label>Heracles</label> And I concur.</p>

<p><label>Athene</label> Sire, I dissent entirely; you should not fill Heaven with apprehensions, nor let your own uneasiness be visible, but take private measures to assure Timocles’s victory and Damis’s being laughed out of court.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> It cannot bekept quiet, Zeus; the philosophers’ debate is public, and you will be accused of despotic methods, if you maintain reserve on a matter of so great and general interest.

<p><label>Zeus</label> Make proclamation and summon all, then. I approve your judgement.

<pb n="v.3.p.83"/>

</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Here, assemble, all ye Gods; don’t waste time, come along, here you are; we are going to have an important meeting.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> What, Hermes? so bald, so plain, so prosy an announcement—on this momentous occasion?</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Why, how would you like it done?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Some metre, a little poetic sonority, would make the style impressive, and they would be more likely to come.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Ah, Zeus, that is work for epic poets or reciters, and I am no good at poetry. I should be sure to put in too many feet, or leave out some, and spoil the thing; they would only laugh at my rude verses. Why, I’ve known Apollo himself laughed at for some of his oracles;_ and prophecy has the advantage of obscurity, which gives the hearers something better to do than scanning verses.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Well, well, Hermes, you can make lines from Homer the chief ingredient of your composition; summon us in his words; you remember them, of course.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> I cannot say they are exactly on the tip of my tongue; however, I’ll do my best:

<l>Let ne’er a God (tum, tum), nor eke a Goddess,</l>
<l>Nor yet of Ocean’s rivers one be wanting.</l>

<l>Nor nymphs; but gather to great Zeus’s council;</l>
<l>And all that feast on glorious hecatombs</l>
<l>Yea, middle and lower classes of Divinity,</l>

<l>Or nameless ones that snuff fat altar-fumes.</l>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg018.perseus-eng4:" n="7">
<p><label>Zeus</label> Good, Hermes; that is an excellent proclamation: see, here they come pell-mell; now receive and place them in correct precedence, according to their material or workmanship; gold in the front row, silver next, then the ivory ones, then those of stone or bronze. A cross-division will give precedence to the creations of Phidias, Alcamenes, Myron, Euphranor, and artists of that calibre, while the common inartistic jobs can be huddled c

<pb n="v.3.p.84"/>

together in the far corner, hold their tongues, and: just make up the rank and file of our assembly.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> All right; they shall have their proper places. But here is a point: suppose one of them is gold, and heavy at that, but not finely finished, quite amateurish and ill proportioned, in fact—is he to take precedence of Myron’s and Polyclitus’s bronze, or Phidias’s and Alcamenes’s marble? or is workmanship to count most?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> It should by rights. Never mind, put the gold first.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> I see; property qualification, comparative wealth, is the test, not merit.—Gold to the front row, please.—</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg018.perseus-eng4:" n="8">
<p><label>Zeus</label> the front row will be exclusively barbarian, I observe. You see the peculiarity of the Greek contingent: they have grace and beauty and artistic workmanship, but they are all marble or bronze— the most costly of them only ivory with just an occasional gleam of gold, the merest surface-plating; and even those are wood inside, harbouring whole colonies of mice. Whereas Bendis here, Anubis there, Attis next door, and Mithras and Men, are all of solid gold, heavy and intrinsically precious.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg018.perseus-eng4:" n="9">
<p><label>Posidon</label> Hermes, is it in order that this dog-faced Egyptian person should sit in front of me, Posidon?</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Certainly. You see, Earth-shaker, the Corinthians had no gold at the time, so Lysippus made you of paltry bronze;
Dog-face is a whole gold-mine richer than you. You must put up with being moved back, and not object to the owner of such a golden snout being preferred.

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Then, Hermes, find me a place in the front row; I am golden.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Not so, Aphrodite, if I can trust my eyes; I am purblind, or you are white marble; you were quarried, I take it, from Pentelicus, turned by Praxiteles’s fancy into Aphrodite, and handed over to the Cnidians.

<pb n="v.3.p.85"/>

</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Wait; my witness is unexceptionable—Homer. ‘The Golden Aphrodite’ he calls me, up and down his poems.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Oh, yes, no doubt; be called Apollo rich, ‘rolling in gold’; but now where will you find Apollo? Somewhere in the third-class seats; his crown has been taken off and his harp pegs stolen by the pirates, you see. So you may think yourself lucky with a place above the fourth.

<p><label>Colossus</label> Well, who will dare dispute my claim? Am I not the Sun? and look at my height. If the Rhodians had not decided on such grandiose dimensions for me, the same outlay would have furnished forth a round dozen of your golden Gods; I
ought to be valued proportionally. And then, besides the size, there is the workmanship and careful finish.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> What shall I do, Zeus? Here is a difficulty again—
too much for me. Going by material, he is bronze; but, reckoning the talents his bronze cost, he would be above the first class.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> What business has he here dwarfing the rest and blocking up all the bench?—Why, my excellent Rhodian, you may be as superior to the golden ones as you will; but how can you possibly go in the front row? Every one would have to get up, to let you sit; half that broad beam of yours would fill the whole House, I must ask you to assist our deliberations standing; you can bend down your head to the meeting.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg018.perseus-eng4:" n="12">
<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Now here is another problem. Both bronze, equal aesthetically, being both from Lysippus’s studio, and, to crown all, nothing to choose between them for birth—two sons of yours, Zeus—Dionysus and Heracles. Which is to be first? You can see for yourself, they mean to stand upon their order.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> We are wasting time, Hermes; the debate should have been in full swing by now. Tell them to sit anyhow, according to taste; we will have an ad boc meeting another day, and then I shall know how to settle the question of precedence.

<p><label>Zeus</label> Call them to order, Hermes; this nonsense must cease, before I can give them the order of the day.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> They do not all know Greek; and I haven’t the gift of tongues, to make myself understood by Scythians and Persians and Thracians and Celts. Perhaps I had better hold up my hand and signal for silence.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Good; they areas quiet as if they were so many teachers of elocution. Now is the time for your speech; see, they are all hanging on your lips.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Why—there is something wrong with me—Hermes, my boy—I will be frank with you. You know how confident and impressive I always was as a public speaker?</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> I know; I used to bein such a fright; you threatened sometimes to let down your golden cord and heave up earth and sea from their foundations, Gods included.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> But to-day, my child—it may be this terrible crisis—
it may be the size of the audience—there is a vast number of Gods here, isn’t there—anyhow, my thoughts are all mixed, I shiver, my tongue seems tied, What is most absurd of all, my exordium is gone clean out of my head; and I had prepared it on purpose to produce a good impression at the start.</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> You have spoiled everything, Zeus. They cannot make out your silence; they are expecting to hear of some terrible disaster, to account for your delay.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> What do you think? Reel off the exordium in Homer?</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Which one?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Lend me your ears, Gods all and Goddesses.

<pb n="v.3.p.87"/>

</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Rubbish! you made quite exhibition enough of yourself in that vein in our cabinet council. However, you might, if you like, drop your metrical fustian, and adapt any one of Demosthenes’s Philippics with a few alterations. That is:the fashionable method with speakers nowadays.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Ah, that is a royal road to eloquence—simplifies matters very much for a man in difficulties.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg018.perseus-eng4:" n="15">
<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Go ahead, then.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Men of—Heaven, I presume that you would be willing to pay a great price, if you could know what in the world has occasioned the present summons. Which being s0, it is fitting that you should give a ready hearing to my words. Now, whereas the present crisis, Heavenians, may almost be said to lift up a voice and bid us take vigorous hold on opportunity, it seems to me that we are letting it slip from our nerveless grasp. And I wish now (I can’t remember any more) to exhibit clearly to you the apprehensions which have led to my summoning you.</p>

<p>As you are all aware, Mnesitheus the ship’s-captain yesterday made his votive offering for the narrow escape of his vessel off Caphereus, and those of us whom he had invited attended the.
banquet in Piraeus. After the libations you went your several ways. I myself, as it was not very late, walked up to town for an afternoon stroll in Ceramicus, reflecting as I went on the parsimony of Mnesitheus. When the ship was driving against the cliff, and already inside the circle of reef, he had vowed whole hecatombs: what he offered in fact, with sixteen Gods to entertain, was a single cock—an old bird afflicted with catarrh—and half a dozen grains of frankincense; these were all mildewed, so that they at once fizzled out on the embers, hardly giving enough smoke to tickle the olfactories.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg018.perseus-eng4:" n="16">
<p>Engaged in these thoughts I reached the Poecile, and there found a great crowd gathered; there were some inside the Portico, a large number outside, and a few seated on the benches vociferating

<pb n="v.3.p.88"/>

as loud as they could. Guessing correctly that these were philosophers of the militant variety, I had a mind to stop and hear what they were saying. I was enveloped in a good thick cloud, under cover of which I assumed their habit, lengthened my beard, and so made a passable philosopher; then I elbowed my way through the crowd and got in undetected. I found an accomplished scoundrel and a pattern of human virtue at daggers drawn; they were Damis the Epicurean and Timocles the Stoic. The latter was bathed in perspiration, and his voice showed signs of wear, while Damis goaded him on to further exertions with mocking laughter.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg018.perseus-eng4:" n="17">
<p>The bone of contention was ourselves. Damis—the reptile!
—maintained that we did not concern ourselves in thought or act with human affairs, and practically denied our existence; that was what it came to. And he found some support. Timocles was on our side, and loyally, passionately, unshrinkingly did he champion the cause; he extolled our Providence, and illustrated the orderly discerning character of our influence and government. He too had his party; but he was exhausted and quite husky; and the majority were inclining to Damis. I saw how much was at stake, and ordered Night to come on and break up the meeting. They accordingly dispersed, agreeing to conclude the inquiry next day. I kept among the crowd on its way home, heard its commendations of Damis, and found that his views were far the more popular, though some still protested against condemning Timocles out of hand, and preferred to see what he would say for himself to-morrow.

attributes, honours; we shall sit starving and ineffectual in Heaven; our beloved feasts and assemblies, games and sacrifices, vigils and processions—all will be no more. So mighty is the issue; believe me, it behoves us all to search out salvation; and where lies salvation? In the victory and acceptance of Timocles, in laughter that shall drown the voice of Damis. For I doubt the unaided powers of Timocles, if our help be not accorded him.</p>

<p><label>Momus</label> Hear, then, ye Gods; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. You must know, I foresaw all this clearly—our difficulty—the growth of these agitators; it is ourselves who are responsible for their impudence; I swear to you, we need not blame Epicurus nor his friends and successors, for the prevalence of these ideas. Why, what can one expect men to think, when they see all life topsy-turvy—the good neglected, pining in poverty, disease, and slavery, detestable scoundrels honoured, rolling in wealth, and ordering their betters about, temple-robbers undetected and unpunished, the innocent constantly crucified and bastinadoed? With this evidence before them, it is only natural they should conclude against our existence.</p></div>

<p>The Greeks were mothers’ sons as well as the Persians, I suppose. Or again, when they hear the ballads about our loves, our wounds, captivities, thraldoms, quarrels, and endless vicissitudes (mark you, we claim all the while to be blissful and serene), are they not justified in ridiculing and belittling us? And then we say it is outrageous if a few people who are not quite fools expose the absurdity and reject Providence; why, we ought to be glad enough that a few still go on sacrificing to blunderers like us.

Sciron and Pityocamptes and Cercyon and the rest of them might have gone on battening on the slaughter of travellers, for all you and your Providence would have done.

As far as intelligence goes, he is extremely acute and subtle, so the Stoic experts say; but he spoils it all by the feebleness of his oral explanations; he is confused and unintelligible, deals in paradoxes, and when he is interrogated, explains ignotum per ignotius; his audience does not grasp his meaning, and therefore laughs at him.

<p><label>Timocles</label> What answer is possible to such ribaldry?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> The answer I have been waiting for all this time 3 you can tell me what made you believe in divine Providence.</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> Firstly, the order of nature—the sun running his regular course, the moon the same, the circling seasons, the growth of plants, the generation of living things, the ingenious adaptations in these latter for nutrition, thought, movement, locomotion; look at a carpenter or a shoemaker, for instance; and the thing is infinite. All these effects, and no effecting Providence?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> You beg the question; whether the effects are produced by Providence is just what is not yet proved. Your description of nature I accept; it does not follow that there is definite design in it; it is not impossible that things now similar and homogeneous have developed from widely different origins. But you give the name ‘order’ to mere blind tendency. And you will be very angry if one follows your appreciative catalogue of nature in all its variety, but stops short of accepting it as a proof of detailed Providence. So, as the play says,

<l>Here lurks a fallacy; bring me sounder proof.</l>

<p><label>Damis</label> Magnificent! why, every one will grant you Homer's poetic excellence; but not that he, or any other poet for that matter, is good authority on questions of this sort.

If Thetis had not been moved to compassion and called Briareus, you remember, our excellent Zeus would have been seized and manacled; and his gratitude to her induced him to delude Agamemnon with a lying dream, and bring about the deaths of a number of Greeks. Do you see? The reason was that, if he had struck and blasted Agamemnon’s self with a thunderbolt, his double dealing would have come to light. Or perhaps you found the Diomede story most convincing?—
Diomede wounded Aphrodite, and afterwards Ares himself, at Athene’s instigation; and then the Gods actually fell to blows and went a-tilting—without distinction of sex 3 Athene overthrew Ares, exhausted no doubt with bis previous wound from Diomede; and Hermes the stark and stanch "gainst Leto stood,

If there are altars, there are Gods: there are altars; therefore, there are Gods. Now then.</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Ha, ha, ha! I will answer as soon as I can get done with laughing.</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> Will you never stop? At least tell me what the joke is.</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Why, you don’t see that your anchor (sheet-anchor, too)
hangs by a mere thread. You depend on connexion between the existence of Gods and the existence of altars, and fancy yourself Safe at anchor! As you admit that this was your sheet-anchor, there is nothing further to detain us.

<p><label>Timocles</label> You retire; you confess yourself beaten, then?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Yes; we have seen you take sanctuary at the altars under persecution. At those altars I am ready (the sheet-anchor be my witness) to swear peace and cease from strife.</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> You are playing with me, are you, you vile body-snatcher, you loathsome well-whipped scum! As if we didn’t know who your father was, how your mother was a harlot! You strangled your own brother, you live in fornication, you debauch the young, you unabashed lecher! Don't be in such a hurry; bere is something for you to take with you 5 this broken pot will serve me to cut your foul throat.

<p><label>Zeus</label> Damis makes off with a laugh, and the other after him, calling him names, mad at his insolence. He will get him on the head with that pottery, I know. And now, what are we to do?</p>

<p><label>Hermagoras</label> Why, the man in the comedy was not far out:

Put a good face on’t, and thou hast no harm.</p>

<p>It is no such terrible disaster, if a few people go away infected. There are plenty who take the other view—a majority of Greeks, the body and dregs of the people, and the barbarians to'a man.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Ah, Hermes, but there is a great deal in Darius’s remark about Zopyrus—I would rather have had one ally like Damis than be the lord of a thousand Babylons.
