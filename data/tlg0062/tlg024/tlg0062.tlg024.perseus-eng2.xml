<head>Philosophies for Sale<note><p>This is not a sale of philosophers, nor yet, in any ordinary sense, a sale of lives; it is a sale of various types of the philosophic life, which are to serve their buyers as models for the shaping of their own careers. For a convenient rendering, perhaps "philosophies” will do as well as any
other single word.</p>
<p>Although Lucian makes it perfectly plain that he is not selling specific philosophers, some, if not all, the manuscripts and all the editors ascribe the words of the different types to definite individuals, whereby they not only introduce confusion into the dialogue (working special havoc in the case of the Academic or Platonist type), but they completely stultify the plea which Lucian puts forward in his own defence in the Fisherman, urging that he had not criticized the leading lights of philosophy, but only the common herd of pretended philosophers. This plea is rather specious, it must be admitted, for Lucian vivifies his types again and again with biographical traits; but we should leave him a leg to stand on, and not make him sell Pythagoras, Chrysippus and the rest in their own persons. Therefore I have substituted the names of schools for the names of individual philosophers throughout, but only in the English version: for in the Greek I have not ventured to do this without commanding fuller evidence from the manuscripts.</p>
<p>Diogenes was once taken by pirates and sold into slavery, they say, and Menippus is known to have written a Sale of Diogenes. It may be that Lucian read it and took a hint from it: he could not have taken more.</p>
<p>The order in which the different types are brought on is very effective, as Helm points out, and well deserves attention as one reads. Interesting too are the prices which they bring.</p></note></head>

<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker>
<p>(To an attendant.) You arrange the benches and make the place ready for the men that are coming. (To another avrenpant.) You bring on the philosophies and put them in line; but first groom them up, so that they will look well and will attract as many as possible. (Zo nErmeEs.) You, Hermes, be crier and call them together.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Under the blessing of Heaven, let the buyers now appear at the sales-room. We shall put up for sale philosophies of every type and all manner of creeds; and if anyone is unable to pay cash, he is to name a surety and pay next year. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker>
<p>Many are gathering, so we must avoid wasting time and delaying them. Let us begin the sale, then.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Which do you want us to bring on first?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker>
<p>This fellow with the long hair, the Ionian, for he seems to be someone of distinction.</p></sp> <pb n="v.2.p.453"/> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>You Pythagorean, come forward and let yourself be looked over by the company.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker>
<p>Hawk him now.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>The noblest of philosophies for sale, the most distinguished; who'll buy? Who wants to be more than man? Who wants to apprehend the music of the spheres and to be born again?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>For looks, he is not bad, but what does he know best?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Arithmetic, astronomy, charlatanry, geometry, music and quackery; you see in him a first-class soothsayer.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>May I question him?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Yes, and good luck to you! </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Where are you from?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>From Samos.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.453.n.1">The birthplace of Pythagoras. Hence the “‘ Pythagorean philosophy” talks Ionic Greek.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Where were you educated?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>In Egypt, with the sages there.</p></sp>
<pb n="v.2.p.455"/> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Come now, if I buy you, what will you teach me?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>I shall teach thee nothing, but make thee remember.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.455.n.1">Before centering upon its round of transmigrations, the soul was all-wise; learning is merely remembering. Socrates expounds this theory in Plato’s Jeno.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>How will you make me remember?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>First by making thy soul pure and purging off the filth upon it.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Well, imagine that my purification is complete, what will be your method of making me remember?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>In the first place, long silence and speechlessness, and for five entire years no word of talk.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>My good man, you had better teach the son of Croesus!?<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.455.n.2">One of the sons of Crocsus was mute: Herod. 1. 34, 85.</note> I want to be talkative, not a graven image. However, what comes after the silence and the five years?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt be practised in music and geometry.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>That is delightful; I am to become a fiddler before being wise! </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg024.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="4">
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>Then, in addition to this, in counting.</p></sp>
<pb n="v.2.p.457"/> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>I know how to count now.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>How dost thou count?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>One, two, three, four—</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>Lo! what thou thinkest four is ten, and a perfect triangle, and our oath.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.457.n.1">Four is ten, because it contains three, two and one, and 1 2 3 4 10. The perfect triangle is <figure/></note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Well, by your greatest oath, by Four, I never heard diviner doctrines or more esoteric.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>Thereafter, my friend, thou shalt learn of earth and air and water and fire, what their flux is, and what form they have and how they move.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Why, has fire form, or air, or water?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>Yea, very notably, for without shape and form there can be no motion. And in addition thou shalt learn that God is number and mind and harmony.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What you say is wonderful. </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg024.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="5">
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>And beside all that I have said, thou shalt learn <pb n="v.2.p.459"/> that thou, who thinkest thyself a single individual, art one person in semblance and another in reality.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What’s that? I am another and not this man who now talks to you!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>Now thou art he, but erstwhile thou didst manifest thyself in another body and under another name, and in time thou shalt again migrate into another person.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>You mean that I shall be immortal, changing into many forms? But enough of this. </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg024.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="6">
<sp rend="merge"><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>How do you stand in the matter of diet?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>I eat nothing at all that hath life, but all else save beans.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Why so? Do you dislike beans?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>PYTHAGOREAN</speaker>
<p>Nay, but they are holy, and wonderful is their nature. First, they are nought but seed of man, and if thou open a bean while it is still green, thou wilt see that it resembleth in structure the member of a man; and again, if thou cook it and set it in the light of the moon for a fixed number of nights, thou wilt make blood. But more than this, the Athenians are wont to choose their magistrates with beans.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.459.n.1">The offices were filled by lot, and beans were used for lots. This appears to be Lucian’s own contribution to the Pythagorean mysticism, but the other particulars are not very remote from the actual teachings of the Neo-Pythagoreans, Cf. Porphyr. Vit. Pythag., 44.</note></p></sp> <pb n="v.2.p.461"/> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>You have explained everything duly and sacerdotally. Come, strip, for I want to see you unclothed. Heracles! His thigh is of gold! He seems to be a god and not a mortal, so I shall certainly buy him. (Yo Hermes.) What price do you sell him for?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Ten minas.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>I'll take him at that figure.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker>
<p>Write down the buyer’s name and where he comes from.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>He appears to be an Italian, Zeus, one of those who live in the neighbourhood of Croton and Tarentum and the Greek settlements in that quarter of the world. But there is more than one buyer; about three hundred have bought him in shares.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.461.n.1">A reference to the brotherhood founded by Pythagoras in Magna Grecia, which wielded great political power until it was extirpated in a general revolt about fifty years after the death of Pythagoras.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker>
<p>Let them take him away; let us bring on another. </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg024.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="7">
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Do you want the dirty one over yonder, from the Black Sea?<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.461.n.2">Diogenes, chief of the Cynics, came from Sinope.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ZEUS</speaker>
<p>By all means.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>You there with the wallet slung about you, you <pb n="v.2.p.463"/> with the sleeveless shirt, come and walk about the room. I offer for sale a manly philosophy, a noble philosophy, a free philosophy; who'll buy?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Crier, what’s that you say? Are you selling someone who is free?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>That I am.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Then aren’t you afraid he may have the law on you for kidnapping or even summon you to the Areopagus?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>He doesn’t mind being sold, for he thinks that he is free anyhow.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER </speaker>
<p>What use could a man make of him, filthy as he is, and in such a wretched condition? However, he might be made a shoveller or a drawer of water.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Not only that, but if you make him doorkeeper, you will find him far more trusty than a dog. In tact, he is even called a dog.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.463.n.1">The name of the sect in Greek means doggish.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Where is he from, and what creed does he profess?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Ask the man himself; it is better to do so.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>I am afraid of his sullen, hang-dog look; he may bark at me if I go near him, or even bite me, by Zeus! Don’t you see how he has his cudgel poised <pb n="v.2.p.465"/> and his brows bent, and scowls in a threatening, angry way?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Don’t be afraid; he is gentle. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>First of all, my friend, where are you from?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>Everywhere.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>You see in me a citizen of the world.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Whom do you take for your pattern?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>Heracles.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Then why don’t you wear a lion’s skin? For as to the cudgel, you are like him in that.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>This short cloak is my lion-skin; and I am a soldier like him, fighting against pleasures, no conscript but a volunteer, purposing to make life clean.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>A fine purpose! But what do you know best, and what is your business?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>I am a liberator of men and a physician to their ills; in short I desire to be an interpreter of truth and free speech. <pb n="v.2.p.467"/> </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg024.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="9">
<sp><speaker>BUVER</speaker>
<p>Very good, interpreter! But if IT buy you, what course of training will you give me?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>First, after taking you in charge, stripping you of your luxury and shackling you to want, I will puta short cloak on you. Next I will compel you to undergo pains and hardships, sleeping on the ground, drinking nothing but water and filling yourself with any food that comes your way. As for your money, in case you have any, if you follow my advice you will throw it into the sea forthwith. You will take no thought for marriage or children or native land: all that will be sheer nonsense to you, and you will leave the house of your fathers and make your home in atomb or a deserted tower or even a jar.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.467.n.1">As did Diogenes; for his “tub” was really a jar.</note> Your wallet will be full of lupines, and of papyrus rolls written on both sides. Leading this life you will say that you are happier than the Great King; and if anyone flogs you or twists you on the rack, you will think that there is nothing painful in it.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What do you mean by not feeling pain when I am flogged? I am not enclosed in the carapace of a turtle or a crab!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>You will put in practice the saying of Euripides, slightly revised.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What saying?</p></sp>
<pb n="v.2.p.469"/> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>Your mind will suffer, but your tongue will not.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.469.n.1">Hippol. 612: ἡ γλῶσσ᾽ ὀμώμοχ᾽, ἡ δὲ φρὴν ἀνώμοτος. (My tongue took oath; my mind has taken none).</note> </p></sp></div>

<sp rend="merge"><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p> The traits that you should possess in particular are these: you should be impudent and bold, and should abuse all and each, both kings and commoners, for thus they will admire you and think you manly. Let your language be barbarous, your voice discordant and just like the barking of a dog: let your expression be set, and your gait consistent with your expression. In a word, let everything about you be bestial and savage. Put off modesty, decency and moderation, and wipe away blushes from your face completely. Frequent the most crowded place, and in those very places desire to be solitary and uncommunicative, greeting nor friend nor stranger; for to do so is abdication of the empire.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.469.n.2">Cynic and Stoic cant, meaning that a man cannot mingle with his fellows freely and still be captain of his soul.</note> Do boldly in full view of all what another would not do in secret; choose the most ridiculous ways of satisfying your lust; and at the last, if you like, eat a raw devilfish or squid, and die.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.469.n.3">See Downward Journey, 7, and the note (p. 15).</note> That is the bliss we vouchsafe you. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Get out with you! The life you talk of is abominable and inhuman.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>CYNIC</speaker>
<p>But at all events it is easy, man, and no trouble for all to follow; for you will not need education and doctrine and drivel, but this road is a short cut to fame. Even if you are an unlettered man,—a tanner <pb n="v.2.p.471"/> or a fish-man or a carpenter or a money-changer— there will be nothing to hinder you from being wondered at, if only you have impudence and _ boldness and learn how to abuse people properly.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>I do not want you for any such purpose, but you might do at a pinch for a boatman or a gardener, and only then if my friend here is willing to sell you for two obols at the outside.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>He’s yours: take him. We shall be glad to get rid of him because he is annoying and loud-mouthed and insults and abuses everybody without exception. </p></sp></div>

<p>Call another; the Cyrenaic in the purple cloak, with the wreath on his head.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.471.n.1">The Cyrenaic school, which made pleasure the highest good, was founded by Aristippus, who furnished a detail or two to this caricature.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Come now, attend, everyone! Here we have high-priced wares, wanting a rich buyer. Here you are with the sweetest philosophy, the thrice-happy philosophy! Who hankers for high living? Who'll buy the height of luxury?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Come here and tell me what you know; I will buy you if you are of any use.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Don’t bother him, please, sir, and don’t question him, for he is drunk, and so can’t answer you because his tongue falters, as you observe.</p></sp>
<pb n="v.2.p.473"/> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Who that is in his senses would buy so corrupt and lawless a slave? How he reeks of myrrh, and how he staggers and reels in his gait! But you yourself, Hermes, might tell me what traits he has and what his object in life is.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>In general, he is accommodating to live with, satisfactory to drink with, and handy to accompany an amorous and profligate master when he riots about town with a flute-girl, Moreover, he is a connoisseur in pastries and a highly expert cook: in short, a Professor of Luxury. He was educated in Athens, and entered service in Sicily, at the court of the tyrants, with whom he enjoyed high favour. The sum and substance of his creed is to despise everything, make use of everything and cull pleasure from every source.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>You had better look about for someone else, among these rich and wealthy people; for I can’t afford to buy a jolly life.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>It looks as if this fellow would be left on our hands, Zeus. </p></sp></div>

<p>Remove him; bring on another—stay! those two, the one from Abdera who laughs and the one from Ephesus who cries, for I want to sell them together.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.473.n.1">The Schools of Democritus of Abdera, the propounder of the atomic theory, and of Heraclitus of Ephesus, who originated the doctrine of the flux; he held that fire is the first principle, and its manifestations continually change, so that nothing isstable.

<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>Come down among us, you two. I sell the two best philosophies; we offer the two that are sagest of all.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Zeus! What a contrast! One of thei never stops laughing, and the other is apparently mourning a death, as he weeps incessantly. What is the matter, man? Why are you laughing?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>DEMOCRITEAN</speaker>
<p>Dost thou need to ask? Because to me it seemeth that all your affairs are laughable, and yourselves as well.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What, are you laughing at us all, and do you think nothing of our affairs?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>DEMOCRITEAN</speaker>
<p>Even so; for there is nothing serious in them, but everything is a hollow mockery, drift of atoms, infinitude.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>No indeed, but you yourself are a hollow mockery in very truth and an infinite ass. </p></sp></div>

 <p>Oh, what effrontery! Will you never stop laughing? (Zo the other.) But you, why do youcry? For I think it is much more becoming to talk with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HERACLITEAN</speaker>
<p>Because I consider, O stranger, that the affairs of man are woeful and tearful, and there is naught in them that is not foredoomed; therefore I pity and grieve for men. And their present woes I do not consider great, but those to come in future will be wholly bitter; I speak of the great conflagrations <pb n="v.2.p.477"/> and the collapse of the universe. It is for this that I grieve, and because nothing is fixed, but all things are in a manner stirred up into porridge, and joy and joylessness, wisdom and unwisdom, great and small are all but the same, circling about, up and down, and interchanging in the game of Eternity.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>And what is Eternity?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERACLITEAN</speaker>
<p>A child playing a game, moving counters, in discord, in concord.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Even now I do not understand.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>Of course not, for you are not familiar with our vocabulary and have not the faculty of forming concepts; but a scholar who has mastered the science of logic knows not only this, but what predicaments and bye-predicaments are, and how they differ from each other.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.489.n.2">The hair-splitting Stoics distinguished four forms of predication according to the case of the (logical) subject and the logical completeness of the predicate: the direct, complete predicate, or σύμβαμα (predicament), i.e. Σωκράτης βαδίζει; the indirect, complete predicate, or παρασύμβαμα (bye-predicament), i.e. Σωκράτει μεταμέλει; the direct, incomplete predicate, e.g. Σωκράτης φιλεῖ, and the indirect, incomplete predicate, i.e. Σωκράτει μέλει.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>In the name of wisdom, don’t begrudge telling me <pb n="v.2.p.491"/> at least what predicaments and bye-predicaments are; for I am somehow impressed by the rhythm of the terms.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I do not begrudge it at all. If a man who is lame dashes his lame foot against a stone and receives an unlooked-for injury, he was already in a predicament, of course, with his lameness, and with his injury he gets into a bye-predicament too. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>The word-snares with which I entangle those who converse with me and stop their mouths and make them hold their peace, putting a very muzzle on them. This power is called the syllogism of wide renown.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.491.n.1">The Stoics were noted for their attention to logic and in especial to fallacies.

<p>What of it?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>If a crocodile should seize it on finding it straying beside the river, and then should promise to give it back to you if you told him truly what he intended <pb n="v.2.p.493"/> to do about giving it back, what would you say he had made up his mind to do?<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.493.n.1">The commentators do not seem to have noticed that Lucian has (intentionally) spoiled the sophism by using the words δέδοικα and ἐγνωκέναι. It is perfectly possible for the father to guess what the crocodile “had made up his mind” to do, and so to get the child back: for an intention need not be executed. The crocodile should ask, ‘* Am I going to (μέλλω) give up the child?” Then, if the father answers “Yes,” he will say ‘ You are wrong,” and eat it: and if the father says “No,” he will reply “You are right; therefore I am not going to give it up.”</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Your question is hard to answer, for I don’t know which alternative I should follow in my reply, in order to get back the child. Come, in Heaven’s name answer it yourself and save the child for me, for fear the beast may get ahead of us and devour it!</p></sp>

<p>Courage! I'll teach you other things that are more wonderful.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>The Reaper, the Master,<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.493.n.2">Neither of these are accurately known. The Reaper was based on the fallacious employment of the negative, and proved that a man who was going to reap a field could not possibly reap it. Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school, is said to have paid 200 minas to a logician who taught him seven varieties of this fallacy. The Master consisted of four propositions, of which you could take any three and disprove the fourth.</note> and above all, the Electra and the Veiled Figure.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What do you mean by the Veiled Figure and the Electra?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>The Electra is the famous Electra, the daughter of Agamemnon, who at once knew and did not know the same thing; for when Orestes stood beside her before the recognition she knew that Orestes was <pb n="v.2.p.495"/> her brother, but did not know that this was Orestes.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.495.n.1">Here again Lucian does scant justice to the fallacy, which he really gives away by his statement of it. It should run: ‘she at once knew and did not know that Orestes was her brother, for she did not know that this man was her brother; but this man was Orestes.”</note> As to the Veiled Figure, you shall hear a very wonderful argument. Tell me, do you know your own father?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>But if I put a veiled figure before you and asked you if you know him, what will you say?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>That I don’t, of course. </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg024.perseus-eng2" subtype="section" n="23">
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>But the veiled figure turns out to be your own father; so if you don’t know him, you evidently don’t know your own father.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Not so: I should unveil him and find out the truth! But to go on—what is the purpose of your wisdom, and what shall you do when you reach the summit of virtue?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>I shall then devote myself to the chief natural goods, I mean wealth, health, and the like.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.495.n.2">As the Stoics set great store by “living in harmony with nature,” they divided “things which did not matter” into the “acceptable” and the ‘ unacceptable” according as they were in or out of harmony with the natural wants of man. This did not supersede the classification alluded to above, but was convenient because it enabled them to dispose of certain things which were hard to classify on the other basis. For instance, a good complexion is neither “approved” nor "disapproved” as an aid to the acquirement of virtue, but it is in harmony with nature, and therefore “‘ acceptable.” Hence the Stoics were often accused (as they are constantly accused by indirection in this dialogue) of setting up a double standard.</note> But first I must go through many preparatory toils, whetting my eyesight with closely-written books, <pb n="v.2.p.497"/> collecting learned comments and stufting myself with solecisms and uncouth words; and to cap all, a man may not become wise until he has taken the hellebore treatment three times running.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.497.n.1">A hit at Chrysippus. Hellebore was the specific for insanity, and rumour said that Chrysippus had taken the treatment three times (cf. True Story, 2, 18).</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>These projects of yours are noble and dreadfully courageous. But tobe a Gnipho and a usurer—for I see that this is one of your traits too—what shall we say of this? That it is the mark of a man who has already taken his hellebore-treatment and is consumuinate in virtue?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>Yes; at any rate money-lending is especially appropriate to a wise man, for as drawing inferences is a specialty of his, and as money-lending and drawing interest is next-door to drawing inferences, the one, like the other, belongs particularly to the scholar: and not only getting simple interest, like other people, but interest upon interest. For don’t you know that there is a first interest and a second interest, the offspring,<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.497.n.2">A play upon τάκος, which is literally "offspring.”</note> as it were, of the first? And you surely perceive what logic says: “If he gets the first interest, he will get the second; but he will get the first, ergo he will get the second.” </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>STOIC</speaker>
<p>Your understanding of the matter is correct. You see, I donot take pay on my own account, but for the sake of the giver himself: for since there are two classes of men, the disbursive and the receptive, I train myself to be receptive and my pupil to be disbursive.</p></sp>

<p>That in my opinion nothing at all exists.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Then do not we exist?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>I don’t even know that.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Not even that you yourself exist?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>I am far more uncertain about that.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Oh, what a state of doubt? But what are these scales of yours for?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>I weigh arguments in them and make them balance one another, and when I see they are <pb n="v.2.p.509"/> precisely alike and equal in weight, then, ah! then I do not know which is the truer.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>What else can you do fairly well?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Everything except catch a runaway slave.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Why can’t you do that?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Because, my dear sir, I am unable to apprehend anything.<note xml:lang="eng" n="v.2.p.509.n.1">The same joke is cracked by Lucian in the True Story, 2, 18, at the expense of the New Academy.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Of course, for you look to be slow and lazy. But what is the upshot of your wisdom?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Ignorance, and failure of hearing and vision.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Then you mean being both deaf and blind?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Yes, and devoid of judgement and feeling, and, in a word, no better than a worm.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>I must buy you for that reason. (Zo uenmes.) How much may I call him worth?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>An Attie mina.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Here you are. (Yo scertic.) What have you to say, fellow? Have I bought you?</p></sp>
<pb n="v.2.p.511"/> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Doubtful.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>No, indeed, I have bought you and paid the price in cash.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>I am suspending judgement on that point and thinking it over.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Come now, fellow, walk along behind me as my servant should.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Who knows if what you say is true?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>The crier, the mina, and the men present.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Is there anyone here present?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>Come, I'll chuck you into the mill and convince you that I am your master, with sorry logic!</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>SCEPTIC</speaker>
<p>Suspend judgement on that point.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>BUYER</speaker>
<p>No, by Heaven! I have already affirmed my judgement.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>HERMES</speaker>
<p>(To scertic.) Stop hanging back and go with your buyer. (Zo the company.) We invite you all here to-morrow, for we intend to put up for sale the careers of laymen, workingmen, and tradesmen. </p></sp> </div></div> </body></text></TEI>
