<head>The Goddesse of Surrye<note><p>
An account of the worship of "Juno” (Atargatis) at
Hieropolis in Syria, done, not in Lucian’s customary Attic
Greek, but in the Ionic dialect, after the manner of Herodotus, which Lucian counterfeits so cleverly and parodies so
slyly that many have been unwilling to recognize him as the
author.</p>
<p>It would be most unfair to Lucian to turn this tale into
contemporary English. In order to have the same effect
that it had in his own day, and to be really intelligible, it
must seem to come from the lips of an ancient traveller.
The version here offered seeks to secure that effect through
mimicry of Sir John Mandeville. It is true that Herodotus
was better known in Lucian’s time than Mandeville is
known now, and his language seemed less remote. In every
other respect, however—in his limited vocabulary, in his
simple style, and in his point of view—Mandeville provides
a mask uniquely adapted to the part—if only its wearer
does not fall down in it and break it.</p>
<p>In the notes, which are more extensive than usual because
Lucian’s topic here is outside the ordinary classical range,
several books which have been of particular service are cited
by abbreviated titles: E. Schrader, Die Keilinschriften und
das Alte Testament, pt. ii, Religion und Sprache, 3rd ed.,
1903, by H. Zimmern (Schrader-Zimmern) ; Stanley A. Cook,
Religion of Ancient Palestine, etc., London, 1908 (Cook) ; W. W.
Graf Baudissin, Adonis und Esmun, Leipzig, 1911 (Baudissin),
and his Studien zur Semitischen Religionsgeschichte, 1878
(Studien) ; Sir J. G. Frazer, Adonis, Attis, Osiris, in Golden
Bough, pt iv, London, 1919 (Frazer), and his Folklore in the
id Testament, London, 1919 (Folklore); Albert T. Clay,
A Hebrew Deluge Story, etc, New Haven1921 (Clay).
Those who wish to see the piece in modern English may be
referred to the version by fa A. Strong (London, 1913).
This is supplied with an introduction and notes by J. E,
Garstang, whose commentary will be found to supplement
this in many points, especially in the matter of Hittite
parallels.</p></note></head>

In Surrye, not fer fro the Ryvere Eufrate, is a
Cytee that Holy highte and holy is in sothe, for it
is of Iuno Assurien.<note n="v.4.p.339.n.1"><p>Hierapolis, or better, in accordance with the coins, Hieropolis. It is N.W. of Aleppo, on the main road into Mesopotamia, 15 Roman miles from the crossing of the Euphrates, and by road about 116 Roman miles from Lucian’s birthplace, Samosata. Its Syrian name was Makog, (properly Manbog, i.e. “spring,” according to Baudissin, Studien, ii, 159), in Greek, Bambyce. 1t was dubbed Hieropolis in the time of Seleucus Nicator (Ael. V.H. 12, 2), but the old name persisted (Manbij; le Strange, Palestine under the Moslems, p 500) and still attaches to the ruins, on which see Hogarth, Annual of the British School at Athens, 1907-8, p. 186 sqq ; Cumont, Beudes Syriennes, p. 22 sqq., p. 35 sgq. Lucian does not identify the city with “ancient Ninus,” as do Philostratus and Ammianus. </p></note> Yit I wene that the cyteene
hadde not this name atte firste, whan that it was
founded, but of olden tyme it was other, and after,”

And I that write am Assurien,<note n="v.4.p.339.n.2"><p>Confusion between Assyrian and Syrian is not peculiar to this piece nor to Lucian. It goes back to Herodotus, who says that “Syrian” is the Greek equivalent of the barbarian “Assyrian” (7,63 ; see Macan’s note, and cf. 140). </p></note> and of that that I

But she was not originally or at any time primarily the moon; and in Babylonia, as Ishtar, she had for her emblem a star, the planet Venus (Baudissin, 19). Clay (p. 47) believes that the name Ashera, Ashirta, Ishtar, is that of a mortal woman, an early queen of Hallab (Aleppo). </p></note> But oon of

The temple itself contained, in later days at least, a painting of the Europa episode (Achilles Tatius 1, 1). The story was also localized at Tyre, where the house of Agenor and the bower of Europa were shown (Arrian, Anab. 2, 24, 2; Nonnus, Dionys. 40, 353 sqq.) and where in the eighth century (Malalas, p. 31) the people still mourned the abduction in a feast called the ak) ayer, The name Europa is considered Greek ; whether this particular myth is Cretan or Phoenician in origin the evidence does not seem sufficient to determine. </p></note> Natheles wille

The god, who appears to have been originally Hadad but to have undergone syncrisis with the sun-god and with the Syrian ‘ “Apollo,” was worshipped far and wide as Jupiter Heliopolitanus. The cult image, says Macrobius (Saturn. 1, 23, 10) came from Heliopolis in Egypt by way of Assyria. The ambiguity of Lucian’s Greek (for fepdy suggests “holy place”) seems meant to convey the jocose implication that the magnificent new temple, built by Antoninus Pius, had been transported thither without human hands, </p></note>

So too Adonis to them was simply Adon (Lord); an early name, or perhaps epithet, was Kliun (Philo of Byblos; cf. Baudissin, p. 76, Meyer, Gesch., p. 395). It was only late, if at all, that fe was there identified with Tammuz, upon whom, as fourth king of Erech, see Clay, pp. 44 sgg. The temple, which contained a baetylic stone, is represented on coins (Babelon, Perses Achéménides, p. 200, and pl. xxvii, 1] and 12), </p></note> Thei

I see no reason to suppose that they differed essentially from the Alexandrian rites as described by Theocritus (15 end). From him we learn that Adonis comes to life for but a day, during which he is couched with the goddess in the temple. Next morning the women carry him to the sea-shore, and (cf. scholion) commit him to the waves. Lucian’s phrase és tty hépa xéumovet, which has been curiously interpreted, is to my mind equivalent to #£w oloedues in Theocritus, and the usual éxxoulCovar. </p></note> And alle wommen that wole not lette

She was identified with Hathor at least as early as the Middle Kingdom, and her story contributed to the shaping of the Isis-Osiris myth. When the coffin of Osiris was thrown into the Nile by Typhon, it drifted out to sea, and so to Byblos, where Isis sought and found it (Plutarch, Zsis and Osiris, c. 13 sgg.; cf. Frazer, ii. 9 sqg., 12, 127; Baudissin, pp. 193 sqq. ). </p></note> And I schalle

In the commentary of Cyril on Isaiah 18 (Migne 70, 441) we learn, instead, of an earthen pot that contained a letter from the women of Alexandria to those of Byblos, saying that Aphrodite had found Adonis. There may be something in the tale of its drift, for the Nile current sets over to the Phoenician shore, and it is Nile mud that silts up Phoenician harbours (cf. H. Guthe, Paldstina, p. 27). </p></note>

Byblos.<note n="v.4.p.347.n.1"><p>The Adonis is the present Nahr Ibrahim, a short distance S. of Byblos, “I have crossed it on Easter day when it was turbid and ruddy with the rich red sandstone soil from Lebanon” (C. R. Conder, Palestine, p. 206; cf. Frazer i, 225). A similar discoloration of certain unnamed rivers and springs is implied in the tale of Philo of Byblos that Uranus was mutilated by Cronus at a certain place in the interior near springs and rivers, that his blood flowed into them, and that the place was still pointed out (Miiller, Fr. Hist. Graec., iii, p. 568). Epiphanius (adv. Haeres. 51, 30) bears personal witness that at the exact day and hour of the miracle of Cana the water of a spring at Cibyra in Caria used to turn into wine, and on the word of his brothers that the same was true of the river of Gerasa in Arabia. He does not tell us who is his warrant in the case of the Nile, but observes that that is why the natives bottle and set away Nile-water on a certain date. See also Pausanias 4, 35, 9, and Frazer’s note. </p></note> For they seyn that in tho dayes Adoon
is ywounded up Libanon, and his blod that cometh
into the water chaungeth the ryvere and yeveth the
streme his name. Thus seyn lewed folk. But I
trowe that a man of Byblos spak sothe that devysed
me an other cause of the chaunge, seyinge: “The
Flom Adoon, o straunger, renneth thorgh Libanon,
and erthe of Libanon is right broun. Therfore whan
roughe windes that arysen in tho dayes beren the
erthe to the ryvere, the erthe, that is ful rody,
maketh him blody. So of this chaunge nys not the
blod, as they seyn, the resoun, but the lond.” He
of Byblos devysed me thus; but and al it so be that
he spak trewely, yit to me it semeth passing
merveyllous that the wind aryseth at the righte

Down to the fifth century a bright light appearing in the sky near the temple summoned the worshippers at set times, and an artificial pond gave omens; offerings were thrown into it, which sank if the goddess was favourable or floated if she was adverse (Zosimus i, 58; cf. Socrates 1, 18). The site is eloquently described by Frazer, i, 28, and pictured in Perrot-Chipiez, Hist. de l’Art iii, fig. 18, opposite p. 56 ; for the rock-sculptures in the neighbourhood, to one of which the description of the goddess in Macrobius (Saturn. 1, 21, 5) refers, see Baudissin, p. 78 and pls. i-iii, and for the ruins of the temple, destroyed under Constantine but possibly rebuilt under Talia Rouvier, Bulletin Archéologique, 1900, 169 sqq. Lucian’s amusing reticence is by way of parody on Herodotus, |’ and derives its point from the fact that his reader, knowing: the reputation of the place (Euseb. Vit. Constant. 3, 55), is’ all agog to hear about it. </p></note>

The more partie seyn, Deucalioun, the Scythe,<note n="v.4.p.351.n.1"><p>Deucalion in the réle of a Scythian is odd. Hence Buttmann, rightly recognising that the tale is close akin to the Babylonian flood-story, proposed the reading Σισύθεα, considering Sisythes a possible variant of the name that in Berossus is Xisouthros. This is tempting, and has been widely accepted ; but the mistake, if there be one, is quite as likely to be due to Lucian or to his informant as to a scribe. </p></note>
founded the seyntuarye—that Deucalioun in the
tyme thereof the grete Flode befel. Of Deucalioun
Ihave herd a tale amonges Grekes, that thei tellen

kynde.</p>

<p>
This generacioun, the men of now a dayes, nas not

arke thei alle seyleden whyl the water prevayled.
So seyn Grekes of Deucalioun.<note n="v.4.p.353.n.1"><p>In spite of Lucian’s repeated assurance, the story is more Semitic than Greek. On the West Semitic origin of the flood-story, see Clay, where also a translation of the Babylonian tale according to Berossus may be found (p. 82 sq.). </p></note>

But of that that sewede, men of the Holy Cytee sotiowed
tellen a tale that is worthy of gret merveylle, how
that in here londe opnede a huge hole and resceyvede
alle the water; and whan this happed, Deucalioun
leet maken awteres and leet bylden over the hole a atars
temple halowed to Iuno.<note n="v.4.p.353.n.2"><p>At Gezer, not far from Jerusalem, “there is a living tradition that the waters of the flood burst forth in the neighbourhood” (Cook, p. 107). Likewise at Athens, within the enclosure of Olympian Zeus, in the precinct of Olympian Earth: ‘here the ground is cloven to a cubit’s width; and they say that after the deluge which happened in Deucalion’s time the water ran away down this cleft. Every year they throw into it wheaten meal kneaded with honey” (Pausanias 1, 18, 7, Frazer’s translation). </p></note> I saughe the hole, that is
benethe the temple, a right lityl oon. If whilom it
was gret and now is become suche as it is, I wot
neer, but that I saughe is smal.</p>

<p>
In tokene of that storie thei don thus. Twyes
eech yeer water cometh fro the See in to the temple.
And not prestes only bryngen it, but al Surrye and
Arabye; and fro beyonden Eufrate gon manye men
to the See and bryngen alle watre, that anon thei
scheden out in the temple, and thanne it goth
adoun in to that hole; and al be it that the hole is
smal, natheles it taketh inne gret plentee of water.
And in doynge thus thei seyn that Deucalioun made
suche ordeynaunce for the seyntuarye in memorie of
that tribulacioun and that benefice.<note n="v.4.p.353.n.3"><p>Further details of this rite are given in ¢. 48. Frazer's note on Pausanias l.c. compares an Athenian Hydrophoria connected with the memory of the flood; also the annual water-pouring in the Temple at Jerusalem on the Feast of Tabernacles. The performance was not simply commemorative; the offering at Athens of meal and honey was chthonic, and so was the water-pouring there (Cleidemus in Athenaeus 5, p. 410a). At Hieropolis the object was to quell evil spirits, according to Melito. “But touching Nebo, which is in Mabug, why should I write to you; for lo! all the priests which are in Mabug know that it is the image of Orpheus, a Thracian Magus. And Hadran (i.e. Hadaranes, a double of Hadad) is the image of Zaradusht, a Persian Magus, because both of these Magi practised Magism to a well which is in a wood in Mabug, in which was an unclean spirit, and it committed violence and attacked the passage of every one who was passing by in all that place in which now the fortress of Mabug is located; and these same Magi charged Simi, the daughter of Hadad (cf. c. 33), that she should draw water froin the sea, and cast it into the well, in order that the spirits should not come up,” etc. (Cureton, Spicil, Syr. 44 sq.) Early modern travellers have seen seawater poured into a brook (Baudissin, Studien, ii, p. 181), and it is perhaps significant that nowadays the Jans are angry if water is spilled on the hearth (Baldensperger, Jmmovable East, p. 85).

Astarte) made Derceto fall in love. In her grief and shame, Derceto destroyed the youth, exposed the daughter, and herself leaped into a pool and was turned into a fish. Semiramis was miraculously attended by doves until she was discovered and handed over to Simmas, a royal overseer ; eventually she married Ninus (Ctesias, quoted by Diodorus Siculus 2, 4). She was intimately connected with temple traditions at Hieropolis : two statues of her stood near the temple, with one of which the story was connected that she had once tried to usurp the place of the goddess (cc. 39, 40), and some thought that the “token” of c. 33 represented her. </p></note>. And I

Moore, Carthage of the Phoenicians, frontispiece) represents a woman of strange beauty with the lower part of the body so draped as to give it a close resemblance to a fish’s tail.” But in Hellenistic times the goddess was almost always represented in human form. For other stories of her transformation, see W. Robertson Smith, Eng. Hist. Rev., ii (1887), 303 sg. ; Gruppe, Gr. Mythol. p. 1345; for the survival of the belief into modern times, Niéldeke, Zeitschr. der Deutsch. Morgenlind. Gesellsch. 35, 220. </p></note>. But the ymage in the Holy

Diodorus (2, 4, 6; cf. Hesychius) says that the name Semiramis is derived from the word for dove in the Syrian dialect. At all events the similarity of the Assyrian word summatu (dove) helps to account for her introduction into these stories (Lehmann- Haupt, Roscher’s Lexikon, s.v. Semiramis, p. 694). </p></note> But to me, that the temple was bylded of

Ther is also an other holy storie that I herde from a

longen to Cibella. And alle rytes that Phrygiens and
Lydiens and Samothracyens perfourmen, tho rytes
lerneden thei of Attis. For whan Cibella gelt him,
he cessed to lede the lyf of a man, but chaunged
to femele schappe, and did on wommenes clothynge,

the goddesse for the most partie ressembleth Cibella,
for lyouns drawen hir and sche holt a timbre and
bereth tours on hir hede, right as Lydiens formen
Cibella. Also he spak of Galles that ben in the
temple, seyinge that Galles gelden hem and counterfeten Attis not at alle for no worschipe of luno but
for worschipe of Cibella.<note n="v.4.p.359.n.1"><p>This identification of the Dea Syria with Rhea has been spoken of as a temple-legend. Is it not rather a simple deduction of Lucian’s “wise man,” based upon general resemblance and upon the presence of Galli in both cults? The resemblance, however, was real, and the identification was not unusual ; a striking instance is in Bardesanes, where the Syriac version (Cureton, 31) has Tharatha, the Greek, as quoted by Eusebius, Rhea. It has been revived by modern scholars, notably Meyer, and with good reason ; but whether the “Mother-goddess” is Semitic in origin, as he formerly held, or non-Semitic (Hittite), as he now argues, is still, it seems to me, an open question. See note below on Combabus. </p></note>

 Me liketh what men seyn of the seyntuarye
that acorden fulle wel to hem of Grece,that demen the
goddesse Iuno and the seyntuarye mad of Bachus,
Semeles sone. For withouten doubte Bachus cam
to Surrye in that passage in the whiche he wente to
Ethiope. And in the temple ben manye tokenes of
Bachus foundour, as namely foreyne garnements and
precious stones of Ynde and olifauntes hornes, that
Bachus broght from Ethiope. And two yerdes, or
pileres, stont in the entree, passynge highe, on the

thise yerdes to Iuno my step moder.”<note n="v.4.p.361.n.1"><p>Phallic pillars, further described below, cc. 28-29. The inscription is much too pointed to be genuine ; it is a hoax like that in the True Story 1, 7 (vol. i, p. 255). Pillars were an ordinary feature of Semitic “high places,” both of wood (asherim) and of stone (masseboth) ; see Frazer, Folklore, iii, 62 sqq. In the case of the asherim I know of no direct evidence that they were phallic, but the masseboth, many of which still survive, are sometimes clearly of that nature (Cook, 14, 28 ; see also le Strange, Palestine wnder the Moslems, p. 294, for a curious survival of this significance). The pillars at Hieropolis were made of wood, since cleats were nailed to them; they were therefore asherim, and form a further bond between Ashera (Astarte) and Atargatis. Whether originally phallic or not, they were in Lucian’s day themselves used as “high places” ; see below. </p></note> Now to
me this sufficeth, natheles I schalle seye you another
thing that is in the temple, that longeth to ceremonyes of Bachus. Men of Grece formen yerdes

And now I schalle speke of the temple, wher that it

the temple that stont now is not that oon the

now is the werk of Stratonice, wyf to the Kyng
of Assurye.<note n="v.4.p.361.n.3"><p>Stratonice was daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes and wife of Seleucus Nicator; she was subsequently surrendered by him to his son Antiochus I, Soter, by a former wife, Apama. The famous tale which follows (in Lucian a pure digression, but quite in the Herodotean manner) is rehearsed at length by Plutarch also (Demetrius 38). Rohde has made it pretty clear that, though possible enough (Galen claimed to have detected hidden love in the same way), as far as Antiochus is concerned it is fiction (Griech. Roman, p. 52.) </p></note></p>

the syknesse was love. For of derne (secret) love ther

But within a few months he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus near Lysimachia in Thrace. He built many cities named after him; this Seleucia, 15 miles below Baghdad, is generally called “on the Tigris,” but it lay between the two rivers, which at that point are only 25 miles apart, and the canal Naarmalcha, connecting the Euphrates with the Tigris, flowed by it. </p></note> Thus did

However that may be, Kombabos is Humbaba, and in this story, which is the temple-legend, the name of Kombabos is the significant part ; Stratonice has taken the place of an earlier female. I believe her immediate predecessor was Semiramis, from Ammianus Marcellinus, 14, 6, 17, and her general connection with this site; she in her turn probably ousted an earlier Sima or Ata, with whom Kombabos may have been brought into connection through building or rebuilding the temple (cf.

Meyer, who believes the cult ancient here, but Hittite-Anatolian in its origin, finds evidence of Attis-worship in the name Atargatis (Atat-Ata), which he interprets as the Astarte of Attis; 7.¢., the goddess that is characterized by the worship of Attis (Aesch., p. 650). This view not only leaves Kombabos out of account, but does not reckon with the fact that the deity Ata was often, if not always, thought of as feminine (cf. Baudissin, p. 158, 1). The connection, however, between Attis and Ata is indubitable ; and I believe that there is an analogous connection between Kombabos (Assyr. Hum-ba-ba, Baby]. Hu-wa-wa, with characteristic w for b) and KéBnBos (Gallus), KvB48n (the goddess Cybele). It cannot be mere coincidence that in Syria Ku(m)baba serves Ata, while in Bhrygie Cybebe is served by Attis. That the transfer in which man and goddess exchanged names was from Semitic to non-Semitic soil is, it seems to me, likely from the antiquity of the name Ku(m)baba. Other arguments are not wanting. </p></note></p>

He underlies not only Jupiter Heliopolitanus but Jupiter Dolichenus.

Schrader-Zimmern, p. 778). Compare Tobit, 1, 5.

The identification with Aphrodite, which occurs on inscriptions from Delos, is due to her Astarte side ; to Lucian in this case it is of course particularly suggested by the famous cestus.

The inscription that it bears implores long life for Adad-Nirari, king of Assyria, and for Sammuramat, the Lady of the Palace. Nebo was highly favoured by Semiramis, and also, in later days, by Antiochus Soter, who rebuilt his temple at Borsippa in 268 B.c. At Edessa, near Hieropolis, his worship continued until the coming of Christianity (Cureton, Ancient Syriac Documents, pp. 14, 22, 41). Contemporary testimony to its existence at FReropolie is furnished by Melito; see above, p. 353, note 3. Thestatue at Hieropolis that we find described in Macrobius seems to be a later one; for though it was bearded and clothed, as in Lucian’s day, there was a calathus on the head, a spear topped with a little figure of Victory in the right hand, a flower in the left, a breastplate on his body, and over it a snaky aegis; also, two eagles near by (Saturn, 1, 17, 67-70). </p></note>

Somewhat similar is the practice at Tarsos of erecting a pyre, setting on it an image of the god Sandan, and then burning it up. Frazer (i, 126, 146) associates the two customs and ascribes their origin to the immolation of a human victim, the priest-king. For myself, I should like to know what became of the tree in the Attis-cult, that was cut down and brought into the temple, that the image of Attis might be tied to it (Frazer, i, 267). In the Gilgamesh Epic, Humbaba is posted by Bel as watcher of the cedars (Schrader-Zimmern, 570); and sacred trees still have offerings hung on them (Robertson Smith, Jel. of the Senvites, pp. 185-6). </p></note> To this feste comen manye bothe

On traces of infant sacrifice discovered in the excavations in Palestine, see Cook, pp. 36, 38, 43; Frazer, Folklore i, 418 and note. From recent excavations in asanctuary of Tanit at Carthage, it is apparent that firstborn children were offered to that goddess during the whole period of Punic occupation (Am. Journal of Archaevl., 1923, R 107). “Jephthah’s daughter had many successors before adrian tried to stamp out the practice. At Laodicea a virgin was annually sacrificed to ‘ Athena’ until a deer took her place ; Elagubalus was accused of offering children in his sun-temple at Rome; . . . an Arabian tribe annually sacrificed a child, which they buried beneath the altar that served them as an idol.

The view that this was the “mark of Cain” is forever being advanced anew, only to be anew denied. The practice was forbidden to the Jews (Levit. 19, 28, where the Septuagint reads: kal ypdupara orixta ob worhoere ev éyiv), Among the Moslem population it still survives, but apparently without any religious significance. “A Syrian custom: the workers in tattoo are generally Syrian, and the decoration is seen mainly in Syria and North Palestine” (H. Rix, Tent and Testament, p. 103). In du Soul’s time all Christians who visited the Holy Land came back tattooed, he tells us (Lucian, ed. Hemsterhuys-Reitz, iii, p. 489). </p></note>
