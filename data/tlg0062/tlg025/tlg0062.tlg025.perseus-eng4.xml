Shoulder to shoulder, close the ranks; <l>Let wallet succour wallet, staff aid staff!</l> We are all parties in this war; not one of us but he has assailed.

Now, what shall we do with him? it must be rather an elaborate execution, to meet all our claims upon him; he owes a separate death to every one of us. First Phil. Impale him, say I. Second Phil.

<p>Forbear; spare me; I appeal to the God of suppliants.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker> 
<p>Too late; no loophole is left you now. And you know your Homer: <l>'Twixt men and lions, covenants are null.</l></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>Why, it is in Homer’s name that I ask my boon. You will perhaps pay reverence to his lines, and listen to a selection from him: <l>Slay not; no churl is he; a ransom take</l> <l>Of bronze and gold, whereof wise hearts are fain.</l></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Why, two can play at that game; exempli gratia, <l>Reviler, babble not of gold, nor nurse</l> <l>Hope of escape from these our hands that hold thee.</l></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>Ah me, ah me! my best hopes dashed, with Homer! Let me fly to Euripides; it may be he will protect me: Leave him his life; the suppliant’s life is sacred.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Does this happen to be Euripides too— <l>Evil men evil treated is no evil?</l> <pb n="v.1.p.208"/></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>And will you slay me now for nought but words?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Most certainly; our author has something on that point too: <l>Unbridled lips</l> <l>And folly’s slips</l> <l>Invite Fate’s whips.</l> </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>Oh, very well; as you are all set on murdering me, and escape is impossible, do at least tell me who you are, and what harm I have done you; it must be something irreparable, to judge by your relentless murderous pursuit.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>What harm you have done us, vile fellow? your own conscience and your fine dialogues will tell you; you have called Philosophy herself bad names, and as for us, you have subjected us to the indignity of a public auction, and put up wise men— ay, and free men, which is more—for sale. We have reason to be angry; we have got a short leave of absence from Hades, and come up against you—Chrysippus here, Epicurus and myself, Aristotle yonder, the taciturn Pythagoras, Diogenes and all of us that your dialogues have made so free with. </p></sp></div>

<p>Ah, I breathe again. Once hear the truth about my conduct to you, and you will never put me to death. You can throw away those stones. Or, no, keep them; you shall have a better mark for them presently.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>This is trifling. This day thou diest; nay, even now, <l>A suit of stones shalt don, thy livery due.</l></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>Believe me, good gentlemen, I have been at much pains on your behalf; to slay me is to slay one who should rather be selected for commendation; a kindred spirit, a well-wisher, a man after your own heart, a promoter, if I may be bold to say it, of your pursuits, See to it that you catch not the tone of our latter-day philosophers, and be thankless, petulant, and hard of heart, to him that deserves better of you.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Talk ofa brazen front! So to abuse us is to oblige <pb n="v.1.p.209"/> us. I believe you are under the delusion that you are really talking to slaves; after the insolent excesses of your tongue, do you propose to chop gratitude with us? </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>How or when was I ever insolent to you? I have always been an admirer of philosophy, your panegyrist, and a student of the writings you left. All that comes from my pen is but what you give me; I deflower you, like a bee, for the behoof of mankind; and then there is praise and recognition; they know the flowers, whence and whose the honey was, and the manner of my gathering; their surface feeling is for my selective art, but deeper down it is for you and your meadow, where you put forth such bright blooms and myriad dyes, if one knows but how to sort and mix and match, that one be not in discord with another. Could he that had found you such have the heart to abuse those benefactors to whom his little fame was due? then he must be a Thamyris or Eurytus, defying the Muses who gave his gift of song, or challenging Apollo with the bow, forgetful from whom he had his marksmanship. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>All this, good sir, is quite according to the principles of rhetoric; that is to say, it is clean contrary to the facts; your unscrupulousness is only emphasized by this adding of insult to injury; you confess that your arrows are from our quiver, and you use them against us; your one aim is to abuse us. This is our reward for showing you that meadow, letting you pluck freely, fill your bosom, and depart. For this alone you richly deserve death. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>There; your ears are partial; they are deaf to the right. Why, I would never have believed that personal feeling could affect a Plato, a Chrysippus, an Aristotle; with you, of all men, I thought there was dry light. But, dear sirs, do not condemn me unheard; give me trial first. Was not the principle of your establishing—that the law of the stronger was not the law of the State, and that differences should be settled in court after due <pb n="v.1.p.210"/> hearing of both sides? Appoint a judge, then; be you my accusers, by your own mouths or by your chosen representative; and let me defend my own case; then if I be convicted of wrong, and that be the court’s decision, I shall get my deserts, and you will have no violence upon your consciences. But if examination shows me spotless and irreproachable, the court will acquit me, and then turn you your wrath upon the deceivers who have excited you against me. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Ah, every cock to his own dunghill! You think you will hoodwink the jury and get off. I hear you are a lawyer, an advocate, an old hand at a speech. Have you any judge to suggest who will be proof against such an experienced corrupter as you?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>Oh, be reassured. The official I think of proposing is no suspicious, dubious character likely to sell a verdict. What say you to forming the court yourselves, with Philosophy for your President?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Who is to prosecute, if we are the jury?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>Oh, you can do both; I am not in the least afraid; so much stronger is my case; the defence wins, hands down. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Pythagoras, Socrates, what do you think? perhaps the man’s appeal to law is not unreasonable.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker> 
<p>No; come along, form the court, fetch Philosophy, and I see what he has to say for himself. To condemn unheard is a sadly crude proceeding, not for us; leave that to the hasty people with whom might is right. We shall give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme if we stone 2 man without a hearing, professed lovers of justice as we are. We shall have to keep quiet about Anytus and Meletus, my accusers, and the jury on that occasion, if we cannot spare an hour to hear this fellow before he suffers.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Very true, Socrates. We will go and fetch Philosophy. The decision shall be hers, and we will accept it, whatever it is. <pb n="v.1.p.211"/> </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>Why, now, my masters, you are in a better and more law-abiding mood. However, keep those stones, as I said; you will need them in court. But where is Philosophy to be found? I do not know where she lives, myself. I once spent a long time wandering about in search of her house, wishing to make her acquaintance. Several times I met some long-bearded people in threadbare cloaks who professed to be fresh from her presence; I took their word for it, and asked them the way; but they knew considerably less about it than I, and either declined to answer, by way of concealing their ignorance, or else pointed to one door after another. I have never been able to find the right one to this day. </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg025.perseus-eng4:" n="12"> 
 <sp rend="merge"><speaker>Lucian</speaker>
<p>Many a time, upon some inward prompting or external offer of guidance, I have come to a door with the confident hope that this time I really was right; there was such a crowd flowing in and out, all of solemn persons decently habited and thoughtfulfaced; I would insinuate myself into the press and go in too. What I found would be a woman who was not really natural, however skilfully she played at beauty unadorned; I could see at once that the apparent négligé of her hair was studied for effect, and the folds of her dress not so careless as they looked. One could tell that nature was a scheme of decoration with her, and artlessness an artistic device. The white lead and the rouge did not absolutely defy detection, and her talk betrayed her real vocation; she liked her lovers to appreciate her beauty, had a ready hand for presents, made room by her side for the rich, and hardly vouchsafed her poorer lovers a distant glance. Now and then, when her dress came a little open by accident, I saw that she had on a massive gold necklace heavier than a penal collar. That was enough for me; I would retrace my steps, sincerely pitying the unfortunates whom she led by the—beard, and their Ixion-embracings of a phantom. </p></sp></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg025.perseus-eng4:" n="13"> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>You are right there; the door is not conspicuous, nor <pb n="v.1.p.212"/> generally known. However, we need not go to her house; we will wait for her here in the Ceramicus. I should think it is near her hour for coming back from the Academy, and taking her walk in the Poecile; she is very regular; to be sure, here she comes. Do you see the orderly, rather prim lady there, with the kindly look in her eyes, and the slow meditative walk?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>I see several answering the description so far as looks and walk and clothes go. Yet among them all the real lady Philosophy can be but one.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>True; but as soon as she opens her lips you will know. </p></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Philosophy</speaker> 
<p>Dear me, what are Plato and Chrysippus and Aristotle doing up here, and the rest of them—a living dictionary of my teachings? Alive again? how is this? have things been going wrong down there? you look angry. And whois your prisoner? a rifler of tombs? a murderer? a temple-robber?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Worse yet, Philosophy. He has dared to slander your most sacred self, and all of us who have been privileged to impart anything from you to posterity.:</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Philosophy</speaker> 
<p>And did you lose your tempers over abusive words? did you forget how Comedy handled me at the Dionysia, and how I yet counted her a friend? Did I ever sue her, or go and remonstrate? or did I let her enjoy her holidays in the harmless old-fashioned way? I know very well that a jest spoils no real beauty, but rather improves it; so gold is polished by hard rubs, and shines all the brighter for it. But you seem to have grown passionate and censorious. Come, why are you strangling him like that?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>We have got this one day’s leave, and come after him to give him his deserts. Rumours had reached us of the things he used to say about us in his lectures. </p></sp></div>

<p>No; we decided to refer it all to you. If you will accept the task, the decision shall be yours,</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Philosophy</speaker> 
<p>Sir, what is your wish?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Lucian</speaker> 
<p>The same, dear Mistress; for none but you can find the truth. It cost me much entreaty to get the case reserved for you.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>You call her Mistress now, scoundrel; the other day you were making out Philosophy the meanest of things, when before that great audience you let her several doctrines go for a pitiful threepence apiece.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Philosophy</speaker> 
<p>It may be that it was not Ourself he then reviled, but some impostors who practised vile arts in our name.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>The truth will soon come to light, if you will hear his defence.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Philosophy</speaker> 
<p>Come we to the Areopagus—or better, to the Acropolis, where the panorama of Athens will be before us. </p></sp></div>

<p>I am a Syrian from the Euphrates, my lady. But is the question relevant?

<p>I have; you see what general dislike and danger it brings upon me. However, I do not neglect the complementary branch, in which love takes the place of hate; it includes love of truth and beauty and simplicity and all that is akin to love. But the subjects for this branch of the profession are sadly few; those of the other, for whom hatred is the right treatment, are reckoned by the thousand. Indeed there is some danger of the one feeling being atrophied, while the other is over-developed.</p></sp>

<p>With our lives on earth, Philosophy, you are acquainted; I need not dwell long upon them. Of myself I say nothing; but Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Chrysippus, and the rest— who knows not the benefits that they conferred on mankind? I will come at once, then, to the insults to which we have been subjected by the thrice accursed Parrhesiades. He was, by his own account, an advocate; but he has left the courts and the fame there to be won, and has availed himself of all the verbal skill and proficiency so acquired for a campaign of abuse against us. We are impostors and deceivers; his audiences must ridicule and scorn us for nobodies. Did I say ‘nobodies’? he has made us an abomination, rather, in the eyes of the vulgar, and yourself with us, Philosophy. Your teachings are balderdash and rubbish; the noblest of your precepts to us he parodies, winning for himself applause and approval, and for us humiliation, For so it is with the great public; it loves a master of flouts and jeers, and loves him in proportion to the grandeur of what he assails; you know how it delighted long ago in Aristophanes and Eupolis, when they caricatured our Socrates on <pb n="v.1.p.218"/> the stage, and wove farcical comedies around him. But they at least confined themselves to a single victim, and they had the charter of Dionysus; a jest might pass at holiday time, and the laughing God might be well pleased. </p></sp></div>

Tame submission to insult would naturally enough be taken, not for moderation, but for insensibility and want of spirit. Who could be expected to put up with his last performance? He brought us to market like a gang of slaves, and handed us over to the auctioneer.

<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>There, then. Now, Diogenes, do you know who it is? has the fellow anything to do with you?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Nothing whatever.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Well, what do you put him at? threepence was the price fi I the other day.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>Too much. His flavour and his looks are intolerable— a coarse worthless brute. Drop him head first over the rock, and catch another. But take care your rod does not bend to breaking point.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>No fear; they are quite light—about the weight of a gudgeon.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>About the weight and about the wit. However, up with them. </p></sp></div>

<p>Look; what is this one? a sole? flat as a plate, thin as one of his own fillets; he gapes for the hook; down it goes; we have him; up he comes.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Diogenes</speaker> 
<p>What is he?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Exposure</speaker> 
<p>His plateship would be a Platonist.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>You too after the gold, villain?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Well, Plato? what shall we do with him?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Platonists</speaker> 
<p>Off with him from the same rock. </p></sp></div>

<p>Try again.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Ah, here is a lovely one coming, as far as one can judge in deep water, all the colours of the rainbow, with gold bars across the back. Do you see, Exposure? this is the sham Aristotle. There he is; no, he has shied. He is having a good look round; here he comes again; his jaws open; caught! haul up. <pb n="v.1.p.229"/></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Aristotle</speaker> 
<p>You need not apply to me; I do not know him.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Very well, Aristotle; over he goes. </p></sp></div>

 <sp rend="merge"><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker>
<p>Hullo! I see a whole school of them together, all one colour, and covered with spines and horny scales, as tempting to handle as a hedgehog. We want a net for these; but we have not got one. Well, it will do if we pull up one out of the lot. The boldest of them will no doubt try the hook.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Exposure</speaker> 
<p>You had better sheathe a good bit of the line before you let it down; else he will gorge the gold and then saw the line through.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>There it goes. Posidon grant me a quick ca...: There now! they are fighting for the bait, a lot of them together nibbling at the figs, and others with their teeth well in the gold. That is right; one soundly hooked. Now let me see, what do you call yourself? and yet how absurd to try and make a fish speak; they are dumb. Exposure, tell us who is his master.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Exposure</speaker> 
<p>Chrysippus.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Ah, he must have a master with gold in his name, must he? Chrysippus, tell me seriously, do you know these men? are you responsible for the way they live?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Chrysippus</speaker> 
<p>My dear Parrhesiades, I take it ill that you should suggest any connexion between me and such creatures.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Quite right, and like you. Over he goes head first like the others; if one tried to eat him, those spines might stick in one’s throat. </p></sp></div>

<p>You have fished long enough, Parrhesiades; there are so many of them, one might get away with gold, hook and all, and you have the priestess to pay. Let us go for our usual stroll; and for all you it is time to be getting back to your place, if you are not to outstay your leave. Parrhesiades, you and Exposure can go the rounds now, and crown or brand as I told you. <pb n="v.1.p.230"/></p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Good, Philosophy. Farewell, ye best of men. Come, Exposure, to our commission. Where shall we go first? the Academy, do you think, or the Porch?</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Exposure</speaker> 
<p>We will begin with the Lyceum.</p></sp> 
<sp><speaker>Parrhesiades</speaker> 
<p>Well, it makes no difference. I know well enough that wherever we go there will be few crowns wanted, and a good deal of branding. </p></sp></div> <docAuthor>Henry Watson Fowler</docAuthor> </div>
