<head>Lexiphanes<note><p>Lexiphanes ("Word-flaunter”), whose enthusiasm for
Attic diction is equalled by his want of ideas, of schooling, and
of taste, has his jacket soundly dusted by his friend Lycinus.
The piece is sufficiently similar to the Professor of Public
Speaking to have given rise to the idea that it is aimed at the
same man, and that Lexiphanes is Pollux, the lexicographer
(cf. IV, p. 133). To the argument of E. E. Seiler against
this view (which was not that of Ranke), two points may be
added, which seem to settle the matter. The “namesake
of the sons of Zeus and Leda” cannot be Lexiphanes because
“fifteen, or anyhow not more than twenty, Attic words”
with which to besprinkle his speeches suffice him (IV, p. 155),
whereas Lexiphanes revels in rarities and glories in the obscurity
of his style. Moreover, Lexiphanes is so thoroughly addicted
to this jargon of his that he uses it even in conversation. How,
then (unless we assume that Lucian’s castigation reformed
him), can he ever have written in a style as normal as that
of the Onomasticon ?</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the cult of rare words is not conspicuous
in the Greek prose of the time, but in the Latin, with Fronto
as its most ardent devotee. The Atticists so tempered zeal
with discretion that nothing comparableto the extravagances
of Lexiphanes is to be found outside of the pages of Athenaeus
(III, 97 ¢: Gulick, I, p. 419), where Cynulcus takes Ulpian
to task for just this sort of thing, adverts upon Pompeianus
of Philadelphia as a bird of the same feather, and implies
wider circle by alluding to “the Ulpianean sophists.” This
is certainly the group to which our man belonged (cf. c. 14).
The time is right—just right if Ulpian was the father of the
famous jurist; and these people not only use the selfsame
jargon (see the notes for the parallels), but employ it even in
conversation. Seiler’s contention that Lexiphanes is Pompeianus is highly probable but not wholly certain because it
is impossible to fix the extent to which the vocabulary of the
"Ulpianeans” was common stock.</p>
<p>A conspicuous feature of Lucian’s parody of Lexiphanes
is the use of words no longer generally employed in the old
sense but in a new and very different one, so that double
meanings result. Adequate translation therefore is often
quite impossible, for the lack of an equivalent expression.</p></note></head>

Lexiphanes, the glass of fashion, with a book?
</p>
<p><label>LEXIPHANES</label>
Yes, Lycinus; ’tis one of my own productions of
this very season,<note n="v.5.p.293.n.1"><p>With τητινόν cf. τῆτες, ascribed to Pompeianus of Philadelphia in Athenaeus, III, 98 8. </p></note> quite recent.
</p>
<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Why, are you now writing us something indecent ?<note n="v.5.p.293.n.2"><p>Lucian pretends to confuse νεοχμός (recent, novel) with αὐχμός (drought)—an equivoque quite impossible, I think, to reproduce exactly in English. </p></note>
<label>LEXIPHANES</label>
No, forsooth, and I did not say indecent. Come,
it is full time you learned to apply that word of
mine to things newly indited. It would seem that
your ears are stopped with wax.
</p>
<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Excuse me, my friend. Between indecent and
recent there is a great dealin common. But tell me,
what is the theme of your work?
</p>
<p><label>LEXIPHANES</label>
I am counter-banqueting the son of Aristo in it.




<pb n="v.5.p.295"/>

<label>LYCINUS</label>
There are many “Aristos,” but to judge from
your “banquet’ I suppose you mean Plato.
</p>
<p><label>LEXIPHANES</label>
You rede me right, but what I said would have
been caviare to the general.
</p>
<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Well then, you must read me a few passages from
the book, so that I shan’t miss the feast entirely,
I dare say you will properly “wine us with nectar”
out of it.<note n="v.5.p.295.n.1"><p>Lycinus is quoting a famous mixed metaphor in Homer (Iliad, I, 598 and IV, 3, with the scholia) and implies that he expects Lexiphanes to regale him similarly. </p></note>
<label>LEXIPHANES</label>
Suppress Master Irony, then, and make your ears
permeable before you give them to me. Avaunt
with the obturations of Dame Cypselis!<note n="v.5.p.295.n.2"><p>The name Cypselis (Waxy) is coined from cypselé (ear-wax). </p></note>
<label>LYCINUS</label>
Say your say confidently, for no Cypselus nor any
Periander<note n="v.5.p.295.n.3"><p>Periander comes in because he too was a Cypselid. </p></note> has taken up lodgings in my ears.
</p>
<p><label>LEXIPHANES</label>
Consider withal how I carry myself in the book
—whether it has a good entrance, a rich display of
good discourse and composure,<note n="v.5.p.295.n.4"><p>For εὔλεξις cf. A Professor of Public Speaking, 17 (IV, p. 157). </p></note> and good store of
egregious words.

It is sure to have that, being yours. But do begin
now.

“Then we shall dine,” quoth Callicles, “and then,
at eventide, fetch a turn in the Lyceum; but now
it is high season to endue ourselves with sunburn
and tepify ourselves in the calid ambient, and after
laving, to break bread. We must away forthwith.
My lad, convoy me my strigil, scrip, diapers, and
purgaments to the bath-house, and fetch the wherewithal. ’Tis on the floor, mark you, alongside the
coffer, a brace of obols. And you, Lexiphanes,
whatever shall you do? Shall you come, or tarry
yet a while hereabouts?”
“I too,” said I, “am yearning to ablute these ages

But even in the country I was not unassiduous, for
I found the yokels caroling the harvest-home;
some of them, too, were preparing a grave for my
father. After I had assisted them in the engraving
and for a brief space shared the handiwork of the
dikers, I dispersed them on account of the cold and
because they were getting burned (in severe cold,
you know, burning ensues).<note n="v.5.p.297.n.2"><p>Cf. Athen., 98 B, καύματα, meaning “frosts’ (Pompeianus). </p></note> For myself, I got about

“In the nick of time, however, here he is himself,
and I see he has chaffered beestings-pudden, ashcake, chibbals, hakot, nape of beef—mark you !—

“For my part,” quoth he, “I have got squinny,
master, keeping an eye out for you. Where were you
dining yesterday? With Onomacritus, prithee?”
“Nay, gadzooks,” quoth I: “I made off to the
countryside, helter-skelter. You know how I adore
rusticating. The rest of you no doubt supposed
that I was playing toss-pot. But go you in and
relish all of this; also cleanse the kneading-trough,

said Hellanicus: “I look askew, for my dollies are
obfuscate, I nictitate full oft, and I am lachrymose ;
mine eyes want drugging, I require some scion of
Aesculapius, sage in ophthalmotherapy, who will
compound and decant a specific for me, and so
effect that my ruddy optics may be decoloured
and no longer be rheumatic or have a humorous

Discoursing in this wise, all those of us present
were gone. When we came to the gymnasium, we
despoiled ourselves. One exercised himself at
wrestling with shoulder-holds, another with neckholds, standing; one sleeked himself with unguent
and essayed eluding grasps; one countered the
wind-bag,<note n="v.5.p.301.n.1"><p>He exercised with the “punching-bag.” </p></note> one, grasping leaden sows, whipped his
arms about. Then, once we were dressed down<note n="v.5.p.301.n.2"><p>To Lexiphanes, συντριβέντες is an allusion to the “rub-down”? previous mentioned; but others would infer from it that somebody had cracked their crowns for them. Cf. Athen., 98 A (Pompeianus). </p></note>
and had backed each other, and used the gymnasium
for our sport, Philinus and I imbathed ourselves in
the hot pool and emerged, while the rest, beducking
their sconces in the cold plunge, swam about
subaquaneous in wondrous guise.
</p>

<p>
Upon reversion, we imbusied ourselves with this,
that or t’other. I myself indued my boots, dressed
my scalp with a tined card,<note n="v.5.p.301.n.3"><p>The regular word for comb (κτεῖς or κτένιον) was not elegant enough for Lexiphanes. </p></note> for I had got shorn

Someone else was gobbling lupines, another was
evomiting his jejunity, another was. diminishing
radishes and sopping up a mess of fishy pottage,
another was eating flummery,<note n="v.5.p.303.n.2"><p>In the Greek the food is different (queen olives), but the name carries a similar suggestion of rubbish. </p></note> and yet another engorging barley brose.

When the time was ripe, we dined on our elbows.
Both faldstools and truckles were at hand. The
dinner was picked up;<note n="v.5.p.303.n.3"><p>The phrase dmé cvpdopav to Lexiphanes meant “off contributions” (of the individual guests), but to anyone else in his day it meant “off catastrophes.” </p></note> many different viands had
been made ready, pig’s trotters, spareribs, tripe, the
caul of a sow that had littered, panned pluck, spoonmeat of cheese and honey, shallot-pickle and other
such condiments, crumpets, stuffed fig-leaves, sweets.
Of submarine victuals, too, there were many sorts of
selacian, all the ostraceans, cuts of Pontic tunny in
hanapers, Copaic lassies,<note n="v.5.p.303.n.4"><p>Copaic eels. </p></note> vernacular fowl, muted
chanticleers, and an odd fish—the parasite. Yes,
and we had a whole sheep barbecued, and the
hind-quarter of an edentulous ox. Besides, there
was bread from Siphae, not bad, and novilunar buns,
too late for the fair, as well as vegetables, both
underground and over grown. And there was wine,
not vetust, but out of a leathern bottle, dry by
now but still crude.

quoth Callicles, “for quizzing each other incessantly

“Do you enjoin alogy upon us as if we were inarticulate and elinguid? My tongue is already pregnant
with utterance, and in sooth I set sail in the intent
to archaise with you and wash you up with my
tongue, one and all. But you have treated me as if

Enough, Lexiphanes, both of the drinking-party
and of the reading. I am already half-seas-over and
squeamish, and if I do not very soon jettison all this
gallimaufry of yours, depend upon it, I expect to
go raving crazy with the roaring in my ears from
the words with which you have showered me. At
first I was inclined to laugh at it all, but when it
turned out to be such a quantity and all of a sort, I
pitied you for your hard luck, seeing that you had
fallen into a labyrinthine maze from which there was
no escaping and were afflicted with the most serious
of all illnesses—I mean, were as mad as a hatter.

I have been quietly wondering from what source
you have culled so much pestilential stuff, and how
long it took you, and where you locked up and kept
such a swarm of outlandish distorted expressions,
of which you made some yourself and resurrected
others from the graves in which they lay buried
somewhere. As the verse puts it,
<l>Plague take you, that you garner mortal woes,</l>
such a mess of filthy bilge water did you get together
and fling over me, when I had done you no harm at

you, dropsical as you are and in danger of bursting
with the disease, although to yourself you appear
to be in good point and you consider your calami

to be sure, who do not know what ails you; but the

But what luck! here I see Sopolis the physician
drawing near. Come now, suppose we put you in his
hands, have a consultation with him about your
complaint, and find some cure for you. The man
is clever, and often before now, taking charge of
people like yourself, half crazed and full of drivel,
he has relieved them with his doses of medicine.
—Good-day to you, Sopolis. Do take charge of
Lexiphanes here, who is my friend, as you know,

distemper affecting his speech which is likely to be
the death of him outright. Do save him in one way

What ails him, Lycinus?
</p>
<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Just that, Sopolis! Can’t you hear how he talks?
Abandoning us, who converse with him now, he talks
to us from a thousand years ago, distorting his
language, making these preposterous combinations,
and taking himself very seriously in the matter, as
if it were a great thing for him to use an alien
idiom and debase the established currency of speech.

By Zeus, it is no trivial disorder you tell of, Lycinus.
The man must be helped by all means. As good
luck would have it, I came away with this medicine,
made up for an insane person, so that by taking it he
might throw off his bile. Come, you be the first to
take it, Lexiphanes, that we may have you cured
and cleansed, once you have rid yourself of such
impossible language. Do obey me and take it, and
you will feel better.

I don’t know what you and Lycinus mean to do

I fear your draught may chill my vocabulary.

Drink without delay, that at last you may be

Begin now to lighten yourself. Aha! First, this
“prithee,” then after it “eftsoons” has come up;
then on their heels his “quoth he” and “in some
wise,’ and “fair sir,” and “in sooth,’ and _ his
incessant “sundry.” Make an effort, however; put
your fingers down your throat. You have not yet
given up “instanter” or “pandiculation” or “divagation” or “spoliation.” Many things still lurk in
hiding and your inwards are full of them.<note n="v.5.p.321.n.2"><p>Some of these monde: (λῶστε, ἴκταρ, σκορδινᾶσθαι, τευτάζεσθαι, σκύλλεσθαι) have not been used by Lexiphanes in this present exhibition of his powers.

Well, this man is now purged, unless something
has remained behind in his lower intestines. It is
for you next, Lycinus, to take him on, mending his
education and teaching him what to say.

That I will, Sopolis, since you have cleared the
way for me, and the advice which will follow is to
your address, Lexiphanes. If you really desire to
be genuinely praised for style and to have a great
name among the public, avoid and shun all this sort
of thing. After beginning with the best poets and
reading them under tutors, pass to the orators, and
when you have become familiar with their diction,
go over in due time to Thucydides and Plato—but
only after you have first disciplined yourself
thoroughly in attractive comedy and sober tragedy.
When you have garnered all that is fairest from these
sources, you will be a personality in letters. Before,
you had unconsciously become like the images shaped
for the market by the modellers of figurines, coloured
with red and blue on the surface, but clay on the
inside, and very fragile.

If you do this, abiding for a time the reproach of
illiteracy and feeling no shame to mend your knowledge, you will address the public confidently and
will not be laughed at as you are now, or talked
about in an uncomplimentary manner by our best
people, who dub you “the Greek” and “the
Athenian” when you do not deserve to be numbered
even among the most intelligible of barbarians.
Before all else, however, please remember not to
imitate the most worthless productions of the
Sophists who lived only a little before our own
time, or to go nibbling at that stuff as you do now
—tread that sort of thing underfoot and copy the
ancient models only. And do not let yourself be
enticed by the wind-flowers of speech, but follow
the custom of the athletes and habituate yourself

<pb n="v.5.p.325"/>

to solid nourishment. Above all, sacrifice to the
Graces and to Clearness; you are very remote from
them at present!

As for vanity, boastfulness and
malice, blustering and bawling, away with them,
and with girding at the works of all others and
thinking that you yourself will be first if you carp
at the achievements of everyone else.</p>

<p>
Yes, and there is also this fault which you have,
not a slight one, but rather the greatest possible :
you do not prepare your thoughts in advance of
your words and subsequently dress them out in the
parts of speech, but if you find anywhere an outlandish expression or make one up yourself and
think it pretty, you endeavour to fit the thought to
it and think yourself damaged if you cannot stuff it
in somewhere, even if it is not essential to what you
are saying. For example, the other day, without
even knowing what “‘scintilla” meant, you tossed it
off when it had no relation at all to the subject,
and the vulgar to a man were dazed when its
unfamiliarity struck their ears, but the well-informed
laughed, not only at you but at your admirers.

What is most ridiculous of all is that although you
want to be more than Attic and have meticulously
shaped your diction after the most antiquated
pattern, some (or rather, most) of the expressions
which you intermingle with what you say are
such that even a boy just beginning school would
not fail to know them. For instance, you can’t
think how I prayed for the earth to swallow me as I
listened to the exhibition you made of yourself
when you thought that “shift’? meant a man’s
garment also, and used “slatterns” of male servants
when who does not know that a shift is a female

<pb n="v.5.p.327"/>

garment and that only women are called slatterns?
And there were other things far more obvious than
these, like “‘flopped”<note n="v.5.p.327.n.1"><p>ἐπέτετο (“flew’’) should have been used instead of ἵπτατο; ef. Lobeck’s Phrynichus, ao and Lucian, Soloecista, 48 (Vol. VIII). But Lucian self has the condemned form sometimes; e.g., Vol. III, p. 392, twice. </p></note> and “meeting up”<note n="v.5.p.327.n.2"><p>The active, ἀπαντῶν, should have been employed, not the middle, which is poetic according to Phrynichus (p. 288). </p></note> and
“setting,”<note n="v.5.p.327.n.3"><p>Forms like καθεσθείς are called “outlandish” (ἔκφυλον) by Phrynichus (p. 269) and in the Soloecista, 63; but cf. Lucian, True Story, I, 23, περικαθεσθέντες. </p></note> which are not even naturalised in the
Attic tongue. We do not praise even poets who
compose poems that are all full of rare words, but
your compositions, if I might compare prose to verse,
would be like the “Altar” of Dosiadas, the
“Alexandra” of Lycophron, and whatever else
is still more infelicitous in diction than those works.<note n="v.5.p.327.n.4"><p>For the Altar of Dosiadas see Edmonds, Greek Bucolic Poets p. 506. Lycophron’s Alexandra (A. W. Mair) is in one volume with Gallimnachus and Aratus in the L.C.L. </p></note>
If you imitate the men of whom I have spoken
and if you repair your education, you will have
planned the best possible course for yourself, but if
you unwittingly slip back into your preciosity, I at
least have done my part in advising you and you
may blame yourself, if indeed you are conscious of
deterioration.
