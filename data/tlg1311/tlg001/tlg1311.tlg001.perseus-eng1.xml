    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Now, the teaching of these words is this:<note type="marginal" resp="editor">The explanation</note> <q>Bless those that curse you, and pray for your enemies, and fast for those that persecute you. For what credit is it to you if you love those that love you? Do not even the heathen do the same?</q> But, for your part, <q>love those that hate you,</q> and you will have no enemy.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><q>Abstain from carnal</q> and bodily <q>lusts.</q> <q>If any man smite thee on the <pb xml:id="p.311"/> right cheek, turn to him the other cheek also,</q> and thou wilt be perfect. <q>If any man impress thee to go with him one mile, go with him two. If any man take thy coat, give him thy shirt also. If any man will take from thee what is thine, refuse it not</q>—not even if thou canst.<note type="footnote" resp="editor">The Greek is literally <q>for thou art not even able</q>; but this makes no sense, and though an emendation is difficult the sense must be something like that given by the translation—unless, indeed, the whole phrase be merely a flippant gloss, which has been erroneously taken into the text.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Give to everyone<note type="marginal" resp="editor">Alms-giving</note> that asks thee, and do not refuse, for the Father’s will is that we give to all from the gifts we have received. Blessed is he that gives according to the mandate; for he is innocent. Woe to him who receives; for if any man receive alms under pressure of need he is innocent; but he who receives it without need shall be tried as to why he took and for what, and being in prison he shall be examined as to his deeds, and <q>he shall not come out thence until he pay the last farthing.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But concerning this it was also said, <q>Let thine alms sweat into thine hands until thou knowest to whom thou art giving.</q></p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Thou shalt not be double-minded nor double-tongued, for to be double-tongued is the snare of death.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Thy speech shall not be false nor vain, but completed in action.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Thou shalt not be covetous nor extortionate, nor a hypocrite, nor malignant, nor proud, thou shalt make no evil plan against thy neighbour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Thou shalt not desire a schism, but shalt reconcile those that strive. Thou shalt give righteous judgment; thou shalt favour no man’s person in reproving transgression.</p></div>
