<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="1"> <p rend="align(indent)">This popular leader of yours, Athenians, who has imposed on himself a sentence of death should he be proved to have taken even the smallest sum from Harpalus, has been clearly convicted of taking bribes from those very men whom he formerly professed to oppose. Much has already been said by Stratocles<note resp="editor">Stratocles the orator, who proposed that special honors should be paid to Lycurgus after his death (<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 852a">Plut. Vit. Lyc. 852 A</bibl>), may possibly be the same man as the general of that name who served at <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.</note> and most of the charges have now been made; as regards the report itself the Areopagus has expressed opinions which are both just and true, while with events succeeding this Stratocles has already dealt and read the decrees relating to them. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="2"> <p>It remains for us, Athenians, especially when contesting a case never paralleled in the experience of the city, to make a general exhortation to you all. May we ask you first to pardon those of us who have still to speak if there are certain points which we raise again; our aim is not to weary you by alluding twice to the same matters but to arouse your anger all the more. Secondly, may we ask you not to surrender the rights enjoyed by the whole city or to barter away our common security in exchange for the arguments of the defendant. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="3"> <p>You are aware, Athenians, that whereas this man Demosthenes is here for judgement before you, you are on trial before your fellows. For they are waiting to see what kind of conclusion you will reach about your country's interests: are you going to welcome into your midst the private venality and corruption of these people, or will you make it universally known that you hate men who accept bribes against their city and that, in ordering the Areopagus to make its inquiry, your intention was not to acquit the culprits but rather, when the councillors had made their report, to exact punishment in a manner appropriate to the crimes? This decision then rests with you now. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="4"> <p>For when the people passed a lawful decree and every citizen wished to discover which of the politicians had dared to accept money from Harpalus to the discredit and danger of the city; when, moreover, you, Demosthenes, and many others had proposed in a decree that the Areopagus, according to its traditional right, should hold an inquiry to discover if any of them had received gold from Harpalus, the Areopagus began its investigation. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="5"> <p>In reaching a just decision it paid no heed to your challenges, Demosthenes, nor did it wish to pervert the truth or destroy its own reputation on your account. On the contrary, gentlemen, although, as the Areopagites themselves said, the council realized beforehand the strength of these men and their influence as orators and statesmen, it did not consider that if incrimination or danger was threatening its country it ought to be influenced by any misrepresentation likely to be published about itself. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="6"> <p>Though this investigation has been conducted, in the people's opinion, both fairly and profitably, accusations, challenges, and calumnies are proceeding from Demosthenes, since he has been listed as the holder of twenty talents of gold. Will that council then which, in cases of willful] murder, is trustworthy enough to arrive at truth and justice and is empowered to pass judgement in matters of life and death on each of the citizens, to take up the cause of those who have met a violent end and banish or execute any in the city who have broken the law,<note resp="editor">After the restoration of the democracy in <date when="-0403">403</date> B.C. the Areopagus played a more important part in public affairs than in the preceding half-century. It dealt with all cases of voluntary homicide and sometimes with political cases also, when it could act either on its own initiative (cf. <bibl n="Din. 1.63">Din. 1.63</bibl> and <bibl n="Dem. 18.133">Dem. 18.133</bibl>) or in response to the people's request, as in the present instance. See <bibl n="Din. 1.50" >Din. 1.50</bibl>.</note> be powerless now to administer justice over the money credited to Demosthenes? </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="7"> <p rend="align(indent)">It will; for the council has told lies against Demosthenes. This is the crowning argument in his case. It has told lies, has it, against you and Demades: men against whom it is evidently not even safe to speak the truth; though you previously instructed the Areopagus to investigate many public matters and expressed approval of it for the inquiries which it had held? Are the indictments which the council has made against these men false when the whole city cannot compel them to do right? Great Heavens! </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="8"> <p>Then why, Demosthenes, did you agree in the Assembly to a penalty of death for yourself, if the report of the council should turn out against you? And why have you yourself ruined many others by insisting on the findings of the council? To what authority should the people now refer, or to whom should it entrust the inquiry in the event of mysterious or momentous crimes, if it is to discover the truth? </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="9"> <p>For the council which formerly commanded confidence is being discredited by you, who claim to be the people's man, though it is a body to which the people gave in trust the protection of their lives, to whose charge they have often committed their constitution and democracy, a council which, destined though you were to malign it, has safeguarded your life, according to your own account so often threatened, and which keeps the mystic deposits<note resp="editor">The exact nature of these mystic deposits, on which the welfare of the community was thought to depend, is not known; they were probably oracles.</note> whereby the safety of the city is preserved. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="10"> <p rend="align(indent)">Now in one respect—for I shall speak my mind—the Areopagus fully deserves this treatment. It was faced with two alternatives. One would have been, in accordance with the people's instructions, to conduct the previous investigation over the three hundred talents which came from the Persian king<note resp="editor">After Alexander's accession Darius subsidized several Greek states to oppose him. Three hundred talents offered by him to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and officially refused were said to have been accepted by Demosthenes to be used in the king's interest. Cf. <bibl n="Din. 1.18">Din. 1.18</bibl>; <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.239">Aeschin. 3.239</bibl> (who gives the sum which Demosthenes appropriated as seventy talents); <bibl n="Diod. 17.4">Dio. Sic. 17.4</bibl>.</note>; in which case this monster would have been convicted and the names of those who shared the money published; the betrayal of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, for which Demosthenes was responsible,<note resp="editor">In <date when="-0335" >335</date> B.C., owing to a report that Alexander, who was fighting the Triballi, had been killed, <placeName key="perseus,Thebes" >Thebes</placeName> revolted against Macedonian domination encouraged by Demosthenes and others who assisted them to procure arms. When they applied for assistance to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the Peloponnesians sent an army as far as the Isthmus, while <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> voted help but awaited the turn of events. Meanwhile <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was taken by Alexander and destroyed. Dinarchus, who goes into greater detail later (<bibl n="Din. 1.18">Din. 1.18-22</bibl>), maintains that for ten talents of the Persian money Demosthenes could have secured the help of the Peloponnesian army but was too miserly to do so. Cf. <bibl n="Diod. 17.8" >Dio. Sic. 17.8</bibl>; <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.239">Aeschin. 3.239-240</bibl>.</note> would have been exposed, and we, exacting from this demagogue the punishment he deserved, would have been rid of him. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="11"> <p>Alternatively, if it was your wish to forgive Demosthenes for these offences and to have in the city a large number of people who would take bribes against you, the council ought, having tested your wishes in the previous cases, to have refused to undertake an investigation over the payments of money recently reported. For despite the excellence and the justice of this recent report, which incriminates Demosthenes and the rest of them, and despite the fact that the Areopagus has not deferred to the power of Demosthenes or Demades but has regarded justice and truth as more important, </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="12"> <p>Demosthenes goes round none the less maligning the council and telling the same stories about himself with which he will probably try to mislead you presently. “I made the Thebans your allies.”<note resp="editor">In making this claim Demosthenes was referring to events just before the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName> when he won <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> over to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by offering her more liberal terms than Philip. For his defence of this policy see <bibl n="Dem. 18.153" >Dem. 18.153</bibl> sq.</note> No, Demosthenes, you impaired the common interest of both our states. “I brought everyone into line at <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.” On the contrary you yourself were the only one to leave the line at <placeName key="tgn,7010731" >Chaeronea</placeName>.<note resp="editor">The charge of cowardice in battle is often brought against Demosthenes by Aeschines (e.g. <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.175">Aeschin. 3.175</bibl>); it is mentioned by Plutarch (<bibl n="Plut. Dem. 20.2">Plut. Dem. 855 A</bibl>) and in the <title>Lives of the Ten Orators</title> (<bibl n="Plut. Dec. Orat. 845f" >Plut. Vit. 845 F</bibl>).</note> “I served on many embassies on your behalf.” </p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="14"> <p>You made no allowance for Timotheus,<note resp="editor">The following passage is repeated almost word for word in the speech against Philocles (<bibl n="Din. 3.17">Din. 3.17</bibl>). Timotheus, an Athenian general and a friend of Isocrates, who recounts his exploits (<bibl n="Isoc. 15.107">Isoc. 15.107-113</bibl>), sailed round the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> and gained a victory at <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName> in <date when="-0375" >375</date> B.C. In 365 he took <placeName key="tgn,7002673" >Samos</placeName>, which was occupied by a Persian garrison, after a ten months' siege (<bibl n="Dem. 15.9">Dem. 15.9</bibl>). Thence he moved to <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> and mastered several Chalcidian cities, of which Dinarchus here mentions three. In 356 he was sent out with two others to reinforce the fleet of Chares who was trying to crush an allied revolt; but in a sea battle near <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName> he failed to help Chares, owing to stormy weather, and was therefore prosecuted by him for bribery. Timotheus was not popular owing to his haughty behavior; and being fined the unprecedented amount of a hundred talents, which he could not pay, he went into exile in <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>. Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 15.131">Isoc. 15.131</bibl>.</note> Athenians, although he sailed round the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> and defeated the Lacedaemonians in a naval battle at <placeName key="tgn,7010886" >Corcyra</placeName>, and was the son of <placeName key="tgn,1123029" >Conon</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" ><persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName>, a general in the Peloponnesian war who fought at <placeName key="tgn,6000070" >Aegospotami</placeName>, was later joint commander of the Persian fleet. In this capacity he rendered a service to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by defeating the Spartan Pisander in a naval battle off <placeName key="tgn,5003757" >Cnidus</placeName> in <date when="-0394">394</date> B.C.</note> too who liberated <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.

    <p rend="align(indent)">This citizen, Demosthenes, of such a character, who might well have gained the pardon and gratitude of his colleagues in the public life of those days, since he had rendered great services to the city, not in word only but in deed, and had always remained true to the same policy rather than changing to and fro as you have done, met his death without begging the people for such extensive favors as would set him above the laws or thinking that men who had sworn to vote in accordance with the law should consider anything more important than their word; he was ready even for condemnation, if the jury decided upon it, and did not plead the inclemency of circumstance or express in public opinions which he did not hold. </p> </div>

Since their leader, Astylus, was open to bribery, as Stratocles said, and wanted ten talents as the price of helping the Thebans, the envoys approached Demosthenes who, as they knew, held the King's gold and earnestly begged him to spend the money to save their city. </p> </div>
