        <p> If any others had employed in litigation such a special plea of exception, I should have
          begun my discourse with the facts themselves; but as the situation is, I am compelled
          first to speak of the law in accordance with which we have come before the court, that you
          may cast your votes with an understanding of the issues in our dispute and that no one of
          you may be surprised that I, although defendant in the case, am speaking prior to the
          plaintiff. </p>

              <date when="-0403">403 B.C.</date> after the defeat of the Thirty Tyrants. They had
            taken their stand under Thrasybulus in the harbor-city, Piraeus.</note> you saw that
          some of the citizens were bent upon bringing malicious prosecutions and were attempting to
          violate the Amnesty<note anchored="true" resp="ed">An act passed in <date when="-0403">403
              B.C.</date> by the citizens, after the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants to put an end
            to civic discord and to re-establish the democracy.</note>; so, wishing to restrain
          these persons and to show to all others that you had not made these agreements under
          compulsion, but because you thought them of advantage to the city, you enacted a law, on
          the motion of Archinus, to the effect that, if any person should commence a lawsuit in
          violation of the oaths, the defendant should have the power to enter a plea of exception,
          the magistrates should first submit this question to the tribunal, and that the defendant
          who had entered the plea should speak first; </p>

        <p>and further, that the loser should pay a penalty of one-sixth of the sum at stake. The
          purpose of the penalty was this—that persons who had the effrontery to rake up old grudges
          should not only be convicted of perjury but also, not awaiting the vengeance of the gods,
          should suffer immediate punishment. I thought, therefore, that it was absurd if, under the
          existing laws, I was to permit my calumniator to risk only thirty drachmas, while I myself
          am contesting a suit in which my whole property is at stake. </p>

      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> I intend to prove that Callimachus not only is bringing a suit in violation of the terms
          of the Amnesty agreement, but that he is also guilty of falsehood in his charges, and
          furthermore, that we have already resorted to arbitration in the matter at issue. But I
          wish to relate the facts to you from the beginning; for if you learn that he has suffered
          no wrong at my hands, I think that you will be more inclined to defend the Amnesty and be
          more incensed with him. </p>

        <p> The government of the Ten, who had succeeded the Thirty, was then in control when
          Patrocles, a friend of mine, was the King-Archon,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The most
            important of the Athenian nine archons was not the King-Archon, as the name might
            suggest, but the Archon Eponymus, who gave his name to the year in which he held office.
            The King-Archon had charge of public worship and the conduct of certain criminal
            processes.</note> and with him one day I happened to be walking. Patrocles, an enemy of
          Callimachus who is now prosecuting me in this suit, met him as he was carrying a sum of
          money, laid hold of him, and claimed that this money had been left by Pamphilus and
          belonged to the government; for Pamphilus was a member of the party of the Piraeus.<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 18.2">Isoc. 18.2</bibl> note 1.</note>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Callimachus denied this and as a violent quarrel ensued many others came running up;
          among them by chance Rhinon, who had become one of the Ten, approached. So Patrocles
          immediately laid information with him concerning the money and Rhinon led them both before
          his colleagues. These officials referred the matter to the Council<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">During the rule of the Thirty, and of their successors the Ten, the judicial
            functions of the Athenian juries were usurped by the Council.</note>; after an
          adjudication, the money was declared the property of the state. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Later, after the return of the citizen-exiles from Piraeus, Callimachus brought a charge
          against Patrocles and instituted proceedings against him on the ground that he was
          responsible for his loss. And when he had effected with him a settlement of the matter and
          had exacted from him ten minas of silver, Callimachus maliciously accused Lysimachus.
          Having obtained two hundred drachmas from him, he began to make trouble for me. At first
          he charged me with being the accomplice of the others; in the end, he came to such a pitch
          of impudence that he accused me as responsible for everything that had been done, and it
          may be that even now he will have the effrontery to make just such an accusation. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>In rebuttal, however, I will present to you as witnesses, first, those who were present
          at the beginning of the affair, who will testify that I did not arrest Callimachus nor did
          I touch the money; second, Rhinon and his colleagues, who will tell you that it was
          Patrocles, and not I, who denounced him to them; and finally, the members of the Council,
          who will attest that Patrocles was the accuser.&amp; Please call witnesses of these facts.

      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Although so many persons had been present when the events took place, Callimachus here,
          as if no one had any knowledge of the matter, himself mixed with the crowds, sat in the
          workshops, and related again and again his story, how he had suffered outrageous treatment
          at my hands and had been of his money. And some of his friends came to me and advised me
          to settle the dispute with him, and not deliberately to risk defamation and great
          financial loss, even though I had the greatest confidence in my cause; and they went on to
          say that many decisions rendered in the tribunals were contrary to the expectation of
          litigants, </p>

      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>and that chance rather than justice determined the issue in your courts. Consequently,
          they asserted, it was in my interest to be freed of serious charges by paying a petty sum,
          rather than by paying nothing to run the risk of penalties of such gravity. Why need I
          relate to you all the details? They omitted none of the arguments which are customarily
          urged in such cases. In any case I was finally prevailed upon (for I will tell you the
          whole truth) to give him two hundred drachmas. But in order that it might not be in his
          power to blackmail me again, we committed the arbitration under stated terms<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">A similar example of arbitration under the stated terms(i.e.,

      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> At first Callimachus kept his agreement, but later in complicity with Xenotimus—that
          falsifier of the laws, corrupter of our tribunals, vilifier of the authorities, and author
          of every evil—he brought suit against me for the sum of ten thousand drachmas. But when I
          brought forward in my defense a witness to show that the suit was not within the
          jurisdiction of the court by reason of the previous arbitration, he did not attack my
          witness— </p>

        <p>for he knew that, if he did not receive the fifth of the votes cast, he would be assessed
          a penalty of one-sixth of the amount demanded—but having won over the magistrate, he again
          brought the same suit, in the belief that he risked only his court deposit-fee. And since
          I was at a loss how to cope with my difficulties, I judged that it was best to make the
          hazard equal for us both<note anchored="true" resp="ed">See Introduction to this
            speech.</note> and to come before you. And these are the facts. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> I learn that Callimachus not only intends to speak falsely in the matter of his
          complaint, but will also deny that the arbitration took place, and that he is prepared to
          go so far as to assert that he never would have entrusted an arbitration to Nicomachus,
          whom he knew to be an old friend of ours, and further, that it is improbable that he was
          willing to accept two hundred drachmas instead of ten thousand. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>You must reflect, however, first, that we were not in dispute in the matter of the
          arbitration, but we committed it as an arbitration under stated terms, so that it is not
          at all strange that Callimachus chose Nicomachus as arbiter; it would have been far
          stranger if, after he had come to an agreement about the matter, he had then made
          difficulty about the choice of arbiter. In the next place, it is not reasonable to assume
          that, if ten thousand drachmas had been owing to him, he would have settled for two
            minas<note anchored="true" resp="ed">10,000 drachmas=about $1800 or approximately 360
            sterling; two minas (200 drachmas)=about $36 or between seven and eight pounds.</note>;
          but since his charges were unjust and in the nature of blackmail, it is not astonishing
          that he was willing to take so little. Furthermore, if, after exorbitant demands, he
          exacted little, this is no proof in favor of his contention that the arbitration did not
          take place on the contrary, it confirms all the more our contention that his claim was
          unjust in the first place. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>I am astonished that, while he judges himself capable of recognizing that it was not
          probable that he was willing to take two hundred drachmas instead of the ten thousand, yet
          believes that I am incapable of discovering, if I had wished to lie, that I ought to have
          asserted that I had given him more. But this I ask—that in so far as it would have been an
          indication in his favor that the arbitration did not take place, if he had proved the
          falsity of the testimony, to that same extent it shall be proof in favor of my contention
          that I tell the truth concerning the arbitration, inasmuch as it is clearly shown that he
          did not dare to proceed against my witness. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> I think, however, that even if there had been neither arbitration nor witnesses to the
          actual facts and you were under the necessity of considering the case in the light of the
          probabilities, not even in this event would you have difficulty in arriving at a just
          verdict. For if I were so audacious a man as to wrong others, you would with good reason
          condemn me as doing wrong to him also; but as it is, I shall be found innocent of having
          harmed any citizen in regard to his property, or of jeopardizing his life, or of having
          expunged his name from the list of active citizens, or of having inscribed his name on
          Lysander's list.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">A list of citizens who were deprived of

          punish the evil-doers but they even commanded some persons to do wrong. So as for me, not
          even when they had control of the government, shall I be found guilty of any such misdeed;
          yet Callimachus says that he was wronged after the Thirty had been expelled, the Piraeus
          had been taken, and when the democracy was in power, and the terms of reconciliation were
          being discussed. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart">

          the customary judicial oath which you take in all ordinary cases, and the other is that
          oath which you swore when you ratified the covenant of Amnesty. If in render an unjust
          verdict in this case, you will be violating not only the laws of the city, but also the
          laws common to all men. Consequently, it is not fitting that your votes should be based

          not think that you are so disposed, and I believe that it is easy to controvert the pleas

          regard to the penalty assessed against the loser, if I were responsible for this action,
          you might reasonably sympathize with him as about to be penalized; but the truth is, it is
          he who brings in a calumnious accusation and therefore you cannot in justice accept
          anything he says. </p>

        <p>In the second place, you should consider this point—that all the exiles who returned to
          the city from the Peiraeus would be able to use the very same arguments as he; but no one
          except Callimachus has had the audacity to introduce such a suit. And yet you ought to
          hate such persons and regard them as bad citizens who, although they have suffered the
          same misfortunes as the part of the people, think fit to exact exceptional punishments.

        <p>Furthermore, it is possible for him even now, before he has made trial of your decision,

          him to seek to win your pity while in this jeopardy, for which he himself is responsible,
          and in which he has involved himself, a jeopardy which even now it is possible for him to

        <p>And if he does mention events which occurred under the oligarchy, demand of him that,

            the oligarchs.</note> he prove that it was I who took his money; for this is the issue
          upon which you must cast your votes. And demand that he, instead of showing that he has
          suffered cruel wrongs, prove that it is I who have committed them, I, from whom he seeks

          only which cannot be brought against any persons except those who have committed an act of
          injustice. To these allegations, this will perhaps be a sufficient reply and a further

          on trial. Such persons, if your decision is just, you will enable to dwell in the city
          without fear; otherwise, how do you expect those who remained in the city to feel, if you

        <p>May we not rightly fear that, once your oaths have been violated, we shall again be
          brought to the same state of affairs which compelled us to make the covenant of Amnesty?
          Certainly you do not need to learn from others how great is the blessing of concord or how
          great a curse is civil war; for you have experienced both in so extreme a form that you
          yourselves would be best qualified to instruct all others regarding them. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> But lest it be thought that the reason I am dwelling long on the covenant of Amnesty is
          merely because it is easy when speaking on that subject to make many just observations, I
          urge you to remember when you cast your votes only one thing more—that before we entered
          into those agreements we Athenians were in a state of war, some of us occupying the circle
          enclosed by the city's walls, others Piraeus after we had captured it,<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">The oligarchs were in power in the city; the democratic party
            after their occupation of Phyle (the fort on Mt. Parnes in Attica), captured and held
            Piraeus.</note> and we hated each other more than we did the enemies bequeathed to us by
          our ancestors. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But after we came together and exchanged the solemn pledges, we have lived so uprightly
          and so like citizens of one country that it seemed as if no misfortune had ever befallen
          us. At that time all looked upon us as the most foolish and ill-fated of mankind; now,
          however, we are regarded as the happiest and wisest of the Greeks. </p>

        <p>Therefore it is incumbent upon us to inflict upon those who dare to violate the covenant,
          not merely the heavy penalties prescribed by the treaty, but the most extreme, on the
          ground that these persons are the cause of the greatest evils, especially those who have
          lived as Callimachus has lived. For during the ten years<note anchored="true" resp="ed">A

        <p>on the contrary, all through that period he continued to evade service and to keep his
          property in concealment. But when the Thirty came to power, then it was that he sailed
          back to Athens. And although he professes to be a friend of the people, yet he was so much
          more eager than anybody else to participate in the oligarchical government that, even
          though it meant hardship, he saw fit not to depart, but preferred to be besieged in
          company with those who had injured him rather than to live as a citizen with you, who
          likewise had been wronged by them. </p>

      <div n="49" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And he remained as a participant in their government until that day on which you were on
          the point of attacking the walls of Athens; then he left the city, not because he had come
          to hate the present regime, but because he was afraid of the danger which threatened, as
          he later made evident. For when the Lacedaemonians came and the democracy was shut up in
          the Piraeus,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">By Pausanias, king of Sparta and his general,
            Lysander.</note> again he fled from there and resided among the Boeotians; it is far

          better than you, as if either he alone had suffered injury, or was the best of the

          to trust this man when he speaks in his own behalf, who is proved guilty of perjury in his
          testimony on behalf of another? Who was ever more convincingly proved to be a giver of
          false testimony? You judge all other defendants by what is said of them, but this man's
          testimony the jurors themselves saw was false. </p>

          Why that would be as if Phrynondas<note anchored="true" resp="ed">A notorious swindler;

          or as if Philurgos, who stole the Gorgon's head,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The golden

        <p> But against Callimachus it will be possible to bring accusations time and again, for he
          has contrived his life as a citizen that way; but as for myself, I shall say nothing of
          all my other contributions to the state, but I will merely remind you of that one, a
          service for which, if you would do me justice, you would not only be grateful, but you
          would take it even as evidence bearing upon the case as a whole. </p>

          far surpassed the majority of the trierarchs that I was one of the very few who saved
          their ships: and of these few I alone brought back my ship to the Piraeus and did not
          resign my duties as trierarch; </p>

        <p>but when the other trierarchs were glad to be relieved of their duties and were

          spent, but were trying to conceal the remainder and, judging that the commonwealth was
          completely ruined, were looking out for their private interests, my decision was not the
          same as theirs; but after persuading my brother to be joint-trierarch with me, we paid the
          crew out of our own means and proceeded to harass the enemy. </p>

          no one else dared to bring in even his own, we intercepted the grain that was being
          brought in to them and discharged it at the Piraeus. In recognition of these services you
          voted that we should be honored with crowns, and that in front of the statues of the

          the state was suffering misfortune, were willing to brave the first dangers in your
          behalf, and gratitude is due, not to him who has suffered personal hardships, but to him
          who has conferred benefits upon you; and in the case of those who have become poor, pity
          should be felt, not for those who have lost their property, but for those who have spent

          it should be thought that I plot against the property of others, and that I care naught
          for your poor opinion of me; when it is obvious that I set less store, not merely on my

          possessions, but also that in the hearts of our fellow-citizens at large there might be a
          feeling of gratitude to us as a debt to be paid. It is this that we beg of you now, not
          seeking to have more than is just, but offering proof that we are guilty of no wrongdoing

          you to guard well your present fortune, remembering that while in the past such agreements
