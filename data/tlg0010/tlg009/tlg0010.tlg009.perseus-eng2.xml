        <p> There are some who are much pleased with themselves if, after setting up an absurd and
          self-contradictory subject, they succeed in discussing it in tolerable fashion; and men
          have grown old, some asserting that it is impossible to say, or to gainsay, what is
            false<note anchored="true" resp="ed">So Antisthenes and the Cynics; cf. <bibl

          same questions, others maintaining that courage and wisdom and justice are identical<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">A reference to the views of Plato and the Academy.</note>, and
          that we possess none of these as natural qualities, but that there is one sort of
          knowledge concerned with them all.; and still others waste their time in captious
          disputations that are not only entirely useless, but are sure to make trouble for their
          disciples. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> For my part, if I observed that this futile affectation had arisen only recently in
          rhetoric and that these men were priding themselves upon the novelty of their inventions,
          I should not be surprised at them to such degree; but as it is, who is so backward in
          learning as not to know that Protagoras and the sophists of his time have left to us
          compositions of similar character and even far more overwrought than these? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For how could one surpass Gorgias<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl
              n="Isoc. 15.268">Isoc. 15.268</bibl>. Gorgias of Leontini in <placeName

            in <date when="-0427">427 B.C.</date></note>, who dared to assert that nothing exists of
          the things that are, or Zeno<note anchored="true" resp="ed">This is Zeno of <placeName

            >Italy</placeName>, and not the founder of the Stoic School of philosophy. Zeno and
            Melissus were disciples of Parmenides.</note>, who ventured to prove the same things as
          possible and again as impossible, or Melissus who, although things in nature are infinite
          in number, made it his task to find proofs that the whole is one! </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Nevertheless, although these men so clearly have shown that it is easy to contrive false
          statements on any subject that may be proposed, they still waste time on this commonplace.
          They ought to give up the use of this claptrap, which pretends to prove things by verbal
          quibbles, which in fact have long since been refuted, and to pursue the truth, </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>to instruct their pupils in the practical affairs of our government and train to
          expertness therein, bearing in mind that likely conjecture about useful things is far
          preferable to exact knowledge of the useless, and that to be a little superior in
          important things is of greater worth than to be pre-eminent in petty things that are
          without value for living. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> But the truth is that these men care for naught save enriching themselves at the expense
          of the youth. It is their “philosophy” applied to eristic disputations<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">eristics, “wordy wrangling” “mere disputation for its own
            sake”; cf. General Introd., Vol. I, p. xxi and <bibl n="Isoc. 13.1">Isoc.
            13.1</bibl>.</note> that effectively produces this result; for these rhetoricians, who
          care nothing at all for either private or public affairs, take most pleasure in those
          discourses which are of no practical service in any particular. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>These young men, to be sure, may well be pardoned for holding such views; for in all
          matters they are and always have been inclined toward what is extraordinary and
          astounding. But those who profess to give them training are deserving of censure because,
          while they condemn those who deceive in cases involving private contracts in business and
          those who are dishonest in what they say, yet they themselves are guilty of more
          reprehensible conduct; for the former wrong sundry other persons, but the latter inflict
          most injury upon their own pupils. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And they have caused mendacity to increase to such a degree that now certain men, seeing
          these persons prospering from such practices, have the effrontery to write that the life
          of beggars and exiles is more enviable than that of the rest of mankind, and they use this
          as a proof that, if they can speak ably on ignoble subjects, it follows that in dealing
          with subjects of real worth they would easily find abundance of arguments. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>The most ridiculous thing of all, in my opinion, is this, that by these arguments they
          seek to convince us that they possess knowledge of the science of government, when they
          might be demonstrating it by actual work in their professed subject; for it is fitting
          that those who lay claim to learning and profess to be wise men should excel laymen and be
          better than they, not in fields neglected by everybody else, but where all are rivals.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But as it is, their conduct resembles that of an athlete who, although pretending to be
          the best of all athletes, enters a contest in which no one would condescend to meet him.
          For what sensible man would undertake to praise misfortunes? No, it is obvious that they
          take refuge in such topics because of weakness. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Such compositions follow one set road and this road is neither difficult to find, nor to
          learn, nor to imitate. On the other hand, discourses that are of general import, those
          that are trustworthy, and all of similar nature, are devised and expressed through the
          medium of a variety of forms and occasions of discourse whose opportune use is hard to
          learn, and their composition is more difficult as it is more arduous to practise dignity
          than buffoonery and seriousness than levity. The strongest proof is this: </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>no one who has chosen to praise bumble-bees and salt<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf.
              <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 177b">Plat. Sym. 177b</bibl>, where there is reference to an
              <title>Encomium of Salt</title> by an unknown writer. See <bibl n="Isoc. 12.135">Isoc.
              12.135</bibl>. Cf. Lucian's comic encomium, <title>Praise of the Fly</title>(see
            L.C.L. Lucian, Vol. I, pp. 81 ff.).</note> and kindred topics has never been at a loss
          for words, yet those who have essayed to speak on subjects recognized as good or noble, or
          of superior moral worth have all fallen far short of the possibilities which these
          subjects offer. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For it does not belong to the same mentality to do justice to both kinds of subjects; on
          the contrary, while it is easy by eloquence to overdo the trivial themes, it is difficult
          to reach the heights of greatness of the others<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl
              n="Isoc. 12.36">Isoc. 12.36</bibl>.</note>; and while on famous subjects one rarely
          finds thoughts which no one has previously uttered, yet on trifling and insignificant
          topics whatever the speaker may chance to say is entirely original. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> This is the reason why, of those who have wished to discuss a subject with eloquence, I
          praise especially him who chose to write of Helen<note anchored="true" resp="ed">This
            statement certainly seems to refer to Gorgias, <bibl n="Isoc. 10.">Isoc. 10.</bibl>(see
            particularly the end of that composition which is translated by Van Hook, <title>Greek
              Life and Thought</title>, pp. 162 ff. See also the Introduction to this
            discourse).</note>, because he has recalled to memory so remarkable a woman, one who in
          birth, and in beauty, and in renown far surpassed all others. Nevertheless, even he
          committed a slight inadvertence—for although he asserts that he has written an encomium of
          Helen, it turns out that he has actually spoken a defense of her conduct! </p>
      </div>
      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But the composition in defense does not draw upon the same topics as the encomium, nor
          indeed does it deal with actions of the same kind, but quite the contrary; for a plea in
          defense is appropriate only when the defendant is charged with a crime, whereas we praise
          those who excel in some good quality. But that I may not seem to be taking the easiest
          course, criticizing others without exhibiting any specimen of my own<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">The same sentiment if found in <bibl n="Isoc. 11.9">Isoc. 11.9</bibl>.</note>,
          I will try to speak of this same woman, disregarding all that any others have said about
          her. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> I will take as the beginning of my discourse the beginning of her family. For although
          Zeus begat very many of the demigods, of this woman alone he condescended to be called
          father. While he was devoted most of all to the son of Alcmena<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">Heracles.</note> and to the sons of Leda<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Castor
            and Pollux.</note>, yet his preference for Helen, as compared with Heracles, was so
          great that, although he conferred upon his son strength of body, which is able to
          overpower all others by force, yet to her he gave the gift of beauty, which by its nature
          brings even strength itself into subjection to it. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And knowing that all distinction and renown accrue, not from a life of ease, but from
          wars and perilous combats, and since he wished, not only to exalt their persons to the
          gods, but also to bequeath to them glory that would be immortal, he gave his son a life of
          labors and love of perils, and to Helen he granted the gift of nature which drew the
          admiration of all beholders and which in all men inspired contention<note anchored="true"

          reputedly the son of Aegeus, but in reality the progeny of Poseidon, seeing Helen not as
          yet in the full bloom of her beauty, but already surpassing other maidens, was so
          captivated by her loveliness that he, accustomed as he was to subdue others, and although
          the possessor of a fatherland most great and a kingdom most secure, thought life was not
          worth living amid the blessings he already had unless he could enjoy intimacy with her.

          we shall find that one is deficient in courage, another in wisdom, and another in some

          origin. For being in birth the sons of brothers, the one of Zeus, the other of Poseidon,

          all time to come be considered worthy of such a woman; and furthermore, that he could
          leave no more glorious heritage to his children than by seeing to it that they should be

          one that is beloved; on the contrary, all are despised, except in so far as they possess
          in some degree this outward form, beauty, and it is for this reason that virtue is most
          highly esteemed, because it is the most beautiful of ways of living. </p>

      <div n="55" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And we may learn how superior beauty is to all other things by observing how we ourselves
          are affected by each of them severally. For in regard to the other things which we need,
          we only wish to possess them and our heart's desire is set on nothing further than this;
          for beautiful things, however, we have an inborn passion whose strength of desire
          corresponds to the superiority of the thing sought. </p>

        <p>And while we are jealous of those who excel us in intelligence or in anything else,
          unless they win us over by daily benefactions and compel us to be fond of them, yet at
          first sight we become well-disposed toward those who possess beauty, and to these alone as
          to the gods we do not fail in our homage; </p>

        <p>on the contrary, we submit more willingly to be the slaves of such than to rule all
          others, and we are more grateful to them when they impose many tasks upon us than to those
          who demand nothing at all. We revile those who fall under the power of anything other than
          beauty and call them flatterers, but those who are subservient to beauty we regard as
          lovers of beauty and lovers of service. </p>

        <p>So strong are our feelings of reverence and solicitude for such a quality, that we hold
          in greater dishonour those of its possessors who have trafficked in it and ill-used their
          own youth than those who do violence to the persons of others; whereas those who guard
          their youthful beauty as a holy shrine, inaccessible to the base, are honored by us for
          all time equally with those who have benefited the city as a whole. </p>

        <p> But why need I waste time in citing the opinions of men? Nay, Zeus, lord of all, reveals
          his power in all else, but deigns to approach beauty in humble guise. For in the likeness
          of Amphitryon he came to Alcmena, and as a shower of gold he united with Danae, and in the
          guise of a swan he took refuge in the bosom of Nemesis, and again in this form he espoused
          Leda; ever with artifice manifestly, and not with violence, does he pursue beauty in
          women. </p>

        <p>And so much greater honor is paid to beauty among the gods than among us that they pardon
          their own wives when they are vanquished by it; and one could cite many instances of
          goddesses who succumbed to mortal beauty, and no one of these sought to keep the fact
          concealed as if it involved disgrace; on the contrary, they desired their adventures to be
          celebrated in song as glorious deeds rather than to be hushed in silence. The greatest
          proof of my statements is this: we shall find that more mortals have been made immortal
          because of their beauty than for all other excellences. </p>

          processions, and philosophers should endeavour to speak of her in a manner worthy of her
