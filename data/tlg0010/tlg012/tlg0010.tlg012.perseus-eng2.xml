      <div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Since we Plataeans know, Athenians, that it is your custom not only zealously to come to
          the rescue of victims of injustice, but also to requite your benefactors with the utmost
          gratitude, we have come as suppliants to beg you not to remain indifferent to our having
          been driven from our homes in time of peace by the Thebans. And since many peoples in the
          past have fled to you for protection and have obtained all they craved, we think it
          beseems you more than others to show solicitude for our city; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>for victims of a greater injustice than ourselves, or any who have been plunged into
          calamities so great, you could not find anywhere, nor any people who for a longer time
          have maintained toward your city a more loyal friendship.<note anchored="true" resp="ed"
            >Cf. Herodotus vi. 108. Athens and Platea were allied as early as <date when="-0510">510
              B.C.</date></note> Furthermore, we have come here to ask you for assistance of such a
          kind that your granting it will involve you in no danger whatever and yet will cause all
          the world to regard you as the most scrupulous and most just of all the Greeks. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> If we did not observe that the Thebans have schemed to win you over, by fair means or
          foul, to their contention that they have done us no wrong, we could have finished our plea
          in a few words. But since we have reached such a state of misfortune that we must
          struggle, not only against them, but also against the ablest of your orators, men whom
          they have hired with our resources to be their advocates<note anchored="true" resp="ed"
            >Athenian venal advocates are meant.</note> we must explain our cause at greater length.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> It is difficult indeed not to speak inadequately on the subject of our wrongs. For what
          eloquence could match our misfortunes, or what orator could adequately denounce the wrongs
          the Thebans have done? Nevertheless, we must try to the best of our ability to make their
          transgressions known. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And the chief cause of our indignation is that we are so far from being judged worthy of
          equality with the rest of the Greeks that, although we are at peace<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">This seems to be a reference to the peace of <date when="-0374">374
              B.C.</date>, made between Athens and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta"
              >Sparta</placeName> (see Jebb, <title>Attic Orators</title> ii. p. 177).</note> and
          although treaties exist, we not only have no share in the liberty which all the rest
          enjoy, but that we are not considered worthy of even a moderate condition of servitude.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> We therefore beg of you, citizens of Athens, that you listen to our plea in a friendly
          spirit, reflecting that for us the most preposterous outcome of all would be, if those who
          have always been hostile to your city shall have regained their freedom through your
          efforts, but we, even when we supplicate you, should fail to obtain the same treatment as
          is accorded to your greatest enemies. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> As for the events which have occurred in the past, I see no reason why I should speak of
          them at length. For who does not know that the Thebans have portioned out our land for
          pasturage and have razed our city to the ground? But it is with respect to their argument,
          by which they hope to deceive you, that we shall try to inform you. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> At times, you know, they attempt to maintain that they have subjected us to this
          treatment because we were unwilling to be members of their federation.<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">That is, to join the Boeotian Confederation, of which
              <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> held the hegemony, and thus to be
            tributary ( <foreign xml:lang="greek">SUNTELEI=N</foreign>) to the Thebans.</note> But I
          ask you to consider, first, if on such grounds it is just to inflict penalties so contrary
          to justice and so cruel; next, if it seems to you consistent with the dignity of the city
          of the Plataeans, without their consent but under compulsion, to accept such dependence
          under the Thebans. For my part, I consider that there exists no people more overbearing
          than those who blot out the cities of each of us and compel us, when we have no use for
          it, to participate in their form of polity. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Besides this, they are clearly inconsistent in their dealings with others and with us.
          For when they were unable to gain our consent, they should have gone no farther than to
          compel us to submit to the hegemony of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>
          as they compelled <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and <placeName
            key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>; for in that case we should not have suffered
          irremediable misfortunes. But as it is, they have made it clear that it was not their
          intention to give us that status; on the contrary, it was our territory they coveted. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>I wonder to what precedent in the past they will appeal, and what conceivable
          interpretation of justice they will give, when they admit that they dictate to us in such
          matters. For if it is to our ancestral customs they look, they ought not to be ruling over
          our other cities, but far rather to be paying tribute to the Orchomenians<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed"><placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>,
            stronghold of the Minyans in prehistoric times, joined the Boeotian Confederacy after
            the battle of Leuctra, <date when="-0371">371 B.C.</date></note>; for such was the case
          in ancient times. And if they hold that the treaties are valid, which indeed in justice
          they should be, how can they avoid admitting that they are guilty of wrong and are
          violating them? For these treaties direct that our cities, the small as well as the large,
          shall all alike be autonomous. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> But I imagine that on the subject of the treaties they will not venture to show their
          impudence, but will resort to the argument that we were taking the side of the
          Lacedaemonians in the war and that by destroying us they have benefited the entire
            confederacy.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Evidently a reference to the Second Athenian
            Confederacy, organized in <date when="-0377">377 B.C.</date> and directed against
              <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. cf. p. 147.</note>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>In my opinion, however, no complaint and no accusation should have greater validity than
          the oaths and the treaties. Nevertheless, if any people are to suffer because of their
          alliance with the Lacedaemonians, it was not the Plataeans who, of all the Greeks, if
          justice were done, would have been selected; for it was not of our own free will, but
          under compulsion, that we were subservient to the Lacedaemonians. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Why, who could believe that we had reached such a degree of folly as to have valued more
          highly a people who reduced our fatherland to slavery than the people who had given us a
          share in their own city?<note anchored="true" resp="ed">That is, the Athenians; see
            Introduction.</note> No indeed, but it was difficult for us to attempt a revolt when we
          had so small a city ourselves and the Lacedaemonians possessed power so great, and when
          besides a Spartan governor occupied it with a garrison, and also a large army was
          stationed at <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName>,<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.4.13">Xen. Hell. 5.4.13-22</bibl>. Cleombrotus, king

        <p>of such strength that we should have been destroyed by it not only more quickly than by
          the Thebans, but also with greater right. For it was not fitting that the Thebans in time
          of peace should harbor a grudge against us for what happened at that time, whereas the
          Lacedaemonians, if they had been betrayed by us during the war, with good reason would
          have punished us most severely. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And I think that you are not unaware that many other Greeks, although with their bodies
          they were compelled to follow the Lacedaemonians, yet in sympathy they were on your side.
          What conclusion must we suppose that these others will reach, if they hear that the
          Thebans have persuaded the Athenian people that none ought to be spared who have been
          subject to the Lacedaemonians? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For it will be clearly evident that the Thebans' argument has no other meaning; since it
          is no accusation against our city in particular that has led them to destroy it but, on
          the contrary, they will be able to bring that same charge also against those others. These
          are matters which demand your deliberation and concern, lest the overbearing ways of the
          Thebans shall reconcile those who formerly hated the rule of the Lacedaemonians and cause
          them to believe that the alliance with them is their own salvation. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Remember also that you undertook your most recent war,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"

          freedom of either yourselves or your allies (for you all enjoyed that already), but in
          behalf of those who were being deprived of their autonomy in violation of the oaths and
          covenants. But surely it would be the most outrageous thing in the world, if you are going
          to permit these cities, which you thought ought not to be in servitude to the
          Lacedaemonians, now to be destroyed by the Thebans—men who are so far from emulating your
          clemency that it would have been better for us to suffer at the hands of this city that
          fate which is regarded as the most dreadful of all misfortunes, </p>

        <p>to be taken prisoners of war, than to have got them as neighbors; for those whose cities
          were taken by you by storm were straightway freed of a Spartan governor and of slavery,
          and now they have share in a Council and in freedom, whereas, of those who live anywhere
          near the Thebans, some are no less slaves than those who have been bought with money, and
          as for the rest, the Thebans will not stop until they have brought them to the condition
          in which we now are. </p>

        <p>They accuse the Lacedaemonians because they occupied the Cadmea and established garrisons

          the bodies of their dead, but we do it for the rescue of the survivors. </p>

        <p>But it is not an equal or even similar evil that the dead should be denied burial and
          that the living should be despoiled of their fatherland and all their goods besides: nay,
          in the former case it is a greater disgrace for those who prevent the burial than for
          those who suffer the misfortune, but in the latter, to have no refuge, to be without a
          fatherland, daily to suffer hardships and to watch without having the power to succor the
          suffering of one's own, why need I say how far this has exceeded all other calamities?

        <p> For these reasons we supplicate you one and all, Athenians, to restore to us our land
          and city, reminding the older men among you how piteous a thing it is that men of their
          age should be seen in misfortune and in lack of their daily bread; and the younger men we
          beg and implore to succor their equals in age and not to let them suffer still more evils

        <p>Alone of the Greeks you Athenians owe us this contribution of succor, to rescue us now
          that we have been driven from our homes. It is a just request, for our ancestors, we are
          told, when in the Persian War your fathers had abandoned this land, alone of those who
          lived outside of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> shared in their
          perils and thus helped them to save their city.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl

        <p> If, however, you have determined to have no regard for our persons, yet it is not in
          your interest to let our country at any rate be ravaged, a country in which are left the
          most solemn memorials of your own valor and of that of all the others who fought at your
          side. </p>

          were in commemoration of the victory of all <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
            >Greece</placeName> pitted against all the power of Asia. Although the Thebans have good
          reason for destroying these trophies, since memorials of the events of that time bring
          shame to them, yet it is proper that you should preserve them; for the deeds done there
          gave you the leadership of the Greeks. </p>

        <p>And it is right that you should remember both the gods and the heroes who haunt that

          sacrifice to them that you took upon yourselves a battle so decisive that it established
          the freedom of both the Thebans and all the other Greeks besides. You must also take some
          thought of your ancestors and not be negligent of the piety due to them. </p>

          you are masters, those who saw fit to be the slaves of barbarians had become despots over
          all the other Greeks and that we, who fought at your side for freedom, alone of the
          Greeks, have been driven from our homes, and that the graves of their companions in peril
          do not receive the customary funereal offerings through the lack of those to bring them,
          and that the Thebans, who were drawn up in battle array with the enemy, hold sway over

            >Greece</placeName>, they destroyed us, its benefactors. Do not, therefore, allow your

          especially your oaths and your treaties, and then our devotion to you and the hostility of
          the Thebans, should give a righteous judgement in our cause.</p>
