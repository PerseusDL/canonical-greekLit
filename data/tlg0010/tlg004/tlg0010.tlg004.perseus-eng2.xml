    <body>
      <div type="translation" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg004.perseus-eng2" xml:lang="eng">
      <div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>
          <note anchored="true" resp="ed">It should be noted that we have only the second part of
            the speech, the eulogy of Alcibiades the elder; the first part must have presented the
            statement of facts and the citation of evidence.</note>So then, concerning the team of
            horses<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The “team” consisted of four
          race-horses.</note>—that my father was in possession of them, not by having taken them
          away from Teisias, but by having purchased them from the Argive state—you have heard both
          the Argive ambassadors and the others conversant with the facts testify. But in just this
          same fashion all are accustomed maliciously to accuse me. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>For they obtain leave to bring actions against me on private complaints, but make their
          accusations on behalf of the interests of the state, and they spend more time in
          slandering my father than they do in informing you with respect to their sworn charges;
          and so great is their contempt of the law that they claim personal satisfaction from me
          for the wrongs which, as they say, you suffered at my father's hands. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>But it is my opinion that charges involving the public interest have nothing to do with
          private suits; but as Teisias often reproaches me with my father's banishment, and is more
          zealous concerning your affairs than he is regarding his own, I must address my defense to
          these matters. Certainly I should be ashamed, if I were to seem to any of my
          fellow-citizens to have less concern for my father's good name than for my own peril. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> Now so far as the older men are concerned, a brief statement could have sufficed: for
          they all know that the same men were responsible for the destruction of the democracy and
          for my father's exile; but for the benefit of the younger men, who have lived after the
          events and have often heard the slanderers, I will begin my exposition from an earlier
          time. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> Now the persons who first plotted against the democracy and established the Four
            Hundred,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The Revolution of the Four Hundred in <date
              when="-0411">411 B.C.</date> conducted the Athenian government for only a few
            months.</note> inasmuch as my father, although he was repeatedly invited to join them
          would not do so, seeing that he was a vigorous opponent of their activities and a loyal
          supporter of the people, judged that they were powerless to upset the established order
          until he was removed out of their way. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>And since they knew that in matters pertaining to the gods the city would be most enraged
          if any man should be shown to be violating the Mysteries,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"
            >The Eleusinian Mysteries were celebrated annually at Eleusis in Attica and were
            performed in honor of Demeter and her daughter Persephone.</note> and that in other
          matters if any man should dare to attempt the overthrow of the democracy, they combined
          both these charges and tried to bring an action of impeachment before the senate. They
          asserted that my father was holding meetings of his political club with a view to
          revolution, and that these members of the club, when dining together in the house of
            Pulytion,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Andoc. 1.12">Andoc.
            1.12</bibl>.</note> had given a performance of the Mysteries. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>The city was greatly excited by reason of the gravity of the charges, and a meeting of
          the Assembly was hastily called at which my father so clearly proved that the accusers
          were lying that the people would have been glad to punish them, and furthermore elected
          him general for the Sicilian expedition.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The ill-fated
            Sicilian Expedition, <date from="-0415" to="-0413">415-413 B.C.</date></note>
          Thereupon he sailed away, judging that he had been already cleared of their calumnies; but
          his accusers, having united the Council and having made the public speakers subservient to
          themselves, again revived the matter and suborned informers. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>Why need I say more? They did not cease until they had recalled my father from the
          expedition and had put to death some of his friends and had banished others from the city.
          But when he had learned the power of his enemies and the misfortunes of his friends,
          although he was of opinion that he was being grossly wronged because they would not try
          him when he was in Athens but were for condemning him in his absence, not even in these
          circumstances did my father see fit to desert to the enemy; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>on the contrary, even in exile he was so scrupulous to avoid injuring his city that he
          went to Argos and remained quietly there. But his enemies reached such a pitch of
          insolence that they persuaded you to banish him from Greece entirely, to inscribe his name
          on a column as a traitor, and to send envoys to demand his surrender by the Argives. And
          he, being at a loss to know what to do in the misfortunes which encompassed him and
          everywhere hemmed him in, as he saw no other means of safety, was compelled at last to
          take refuge with the Lacedaemonians. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> These are the actual facts; but such an excess of insolence have my father's enemies
          that they accuse him, who was exiled in so illegal a manner as if he had committed
          outrageous crimes, and try to ruin his reputation by saying that he caused the
          fortification of Decelea,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Decelea was a fort on Mt. Parnes,
            fourteen miles N.E. from Athens. The Lacedaemonians occupied it in <date when="-0413"
              >413 B.C.</date> Cf. <bibl n="Lys. 14.30">Lys. 14.30</bibl>, and for the facts <bibl
              n="Thuc. 6.91.6">Thuc. 6.91.6</bibl>.</note> and the revolt of the islands, and that
          he became the enemy's counsellor. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>And sometimes they pretend to despise him,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl
              n="Lys. 14">Lys. 14.35-38</bibl>.</note> saying that in no respect did he excel his
          contemporaries; yet at the present time they blame him for all that has happened and say
          that the Lacedaemonians have learned from him the art of war—they who can teach the rest
          of the world this accomplishment! As for me, if I had sufficient time, I could easily
          prove that some of those things he did justly, but that others are unjustly imputed to
          him. Yet the most shocking thing that could happen would be this—if, while after his exile
          my father was recompensed, I, because he was exiled, should be penalized. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> I think, however, that in justice he should obtain from you a full pardon; for you, when
          banished by the Thirty Tyrants,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">After the capture of Athens
            by the Spartans in <date when="-0404">404 B.C.</date> an oligarchy known as the Thirty
            Tyrants was established. The cruelty of their government caused many of the democratic
            party to go into exile. Led by Thrasybulus these exiles were restored when the Thirty
            were overthrown in <date when="-0403">403 B.C.</date></note> experienced the same
          misfortunes as he. Wherefore you should reflect how each of you was affected, what
          thoughts you each had, and what peril each would not have undergone so as to bring his own
          banishment to an end and to return to his native land, and to be avenged on those who
          banished him. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>To what city, or friend, or stranger did you not apply, to entreat them to help you to
          get back to your country? From what effort did you abstain in your endeavors to be
          restored? Did you not seize the Piraeus and destroy the crops in the fields and harry the
          land and set fire to the suburbs and finally assault the walls? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>And so vehemently did you believe that these actions were justifiable that you were more
          indignant with those of your fellow-exiles who were inactive than with those who had been
          the authors of your misfortunes. It is not fair, therefore, to censure those who wanted
          the same things which you desired, nor yet to regard all those men as base who, when they
          were exiles, sought to return, but much more should you condemn those oligarchs who,
          remaining in Athens, did deeds which deserved the penalty of exile; nor is it fair that
          you, in judging what sort of citizen my father was, should begin at the time when he had
          no art in the city's affairs; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>on the contrary, you should look to that earlier time and observe how he served the
          people before his exile, and call to mind that with two hundred heavy-armed soldiers he
          caused the most powerful cities in the Peloponnesus to revolt from the
            Lacedaemonians,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"><date when="-0419">419 B.C.</date> Cf.
              <bibl n="Thuc. 5.52.2">Thuc. 5.52.2</bibl>.</note> and brought them into alliance with
          you, and in what perils he involved the Lacedaemonians themselves, and how he behaved as
          general in Sicily. For these services he is deserving of your gratitude; but for that
          which happened when he was in misfortune it is those who banished him whom you would
          justly hold responsible. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> Remember, too, I beg you, the many benefits he conferred upon the city after his return
          from exile, and, even before that time, the state of affairs here when you received him
          back: the democracy had been overthrown,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">By the Revolution
            of the Four Hundred.</note> the citizens were in a state of civil war, the army was
          disaffected toward the government established here, and both parties had reached such a
          state of madness that neither had any hope of salvation. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>For the one party<note anchored="true" resp="ed">the Athenian army and fleet, sympathetic
            the the democracy, were at the island of Samos (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.82">Thuc. 8.82</bibl>
            and <bibl n="Thuc. 8.86">Thuc. 8.86</bibl>).</note> regarded those who were in
          possession of the city as greater enemies than the Lacedaemonians<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">The oligarchs in Athens.</note> and the other were making overtures to the
          Spartan forces in Decelea, judging that it was preferable to hand over their country to
          its enemies rather than to give a share in the rights of citizenship to those who were
          fighting for the city. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>Such was the state of mind of the citizens: the enemy was in control of land and sea;
          your financial resources were exhausted, while the Persian king was supplying them with
          funds; furthermore, ninety ships had come from Phoenicia<note anchored="true" resp="ed"
            >The Persian king depended largely upon Phoenicia for ships of war.</note> to
            Aspendus<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Aspendus, a town in Asia Minor, in Pamphylia,
            was situated on the river Eurymedon.</note> and were prepared to aid the Lacedaemonians.
          By so many misfortunes and such perils was the city beset </p>
      </div>
      <div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>when the army summoned my father, and he did not treat them with disdain in their plight,
          nor did he rebuke them for the past, nor did he deliberate about the future; on the
          contrary, he chose at once to suffer any misfortune with his country rather than to enjoy
          prosperity with the Lacedaemonians, and he made it manifest to all that he was warring on
          those who had banished him and not on you, and that his heart was set on a return to
          Athens and not on her ruin. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>Having thrown in his lot with you, he persuaded Tissaphernes<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">Persian satrap of western Asia Minor from <date when="-0414">414

        <p> Now this friendship with the people, which was, as I have shown, so ancient, genuine,
          and based upon services of the greatest importance, my father inherited from his
          ancestors. My father himself was left an orphan (for his father<note anchored="true"

            town in Boeotia where the Athenians were defeated by the Boeotians in <date when="-0466"

          to have been the most moderate, the most just, and the wisest of the citizens. For I count
          this also among his blessings that, being of such origin, he was fostered, reared, and
          educated under the guardianship of a man of such character. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>When he was admitted to citizenship, he showed himself not inferior to those whom I have
          mentioned, nor did he think it fitting that he should lead a life of ease, pluming himself
          upon the brave deeds of his ancestors; on the contrary, from the beginning he was so fired
          with ambition that he thought that even their great deeds should be held in remembrance
          through his own. And first of all, when Phormio<note anchored="true" resp="ed">A famous
            Athenian general.</note> led a thousand of the flower of Athenian soldiers to
            Thrace,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Expedition to recover the city of Potidaea in

      </div>
      <div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>Really what is required of the man who is thought worthy of the highest praise? Should he
          not, when serving with the bravest of the citizens, be thought worthy of the prize of
          valor, and when leading an army against the best of the Greeks in all the battles show his
          superiority to them? My father, then, in his youth did win that prize of valor and in
          later life did achieve the latter. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> After this he married my mother<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Hipparet.</note>; and I
          believe that in her he also won a glorious prize of valor. For her father was
            Hipponicus,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Son of Callias, noted for his wealth.</note>
          first in wealth of all the Greeks and second in birth to none of the citizens, most
          honored and admired of his contemporaries. The richest dowry and fairest reputation went
          with his daughter's hand; and although all coveted union with her, and only the greatest
          thought themselves worthy, it was my father whom Hipponicus chose from among them all and
          desired to make his son-in-law. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> About the same time my father, seeing that the festival assembly at Olympia was beloved
          and admired by the whole world and that in it the Greeks made display of their wealth,
          strength of body, and training, and that not only the athletes were the objects of envy
          but that also the cities of the victors became renowned, and believing moreover that while
          the public services performed in Athens redound to the prestige, in the eyes of his
          fellow-citizens, of the person who renders them, expenditures in the Olympian Festival,
          however, enhance the city's reputation throughout all Greece, </p>
      </div>
      <div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>reflecting upon these things, I say, although in natural gifts and in strength of body he
          was inferior to none, he disdained the gymnastic contests, for he knew that some of the
          athletes were of low birth, inhabitants of petty states, and of mean education, but turned
          to the breeding of race-horses, which is possible only for those most blest by Fortune and
          not to be pursued by one of low estate, and not only did he surpass his rivals, but also
          all who had ever before won the victory. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>For he entered a larger number of teams in competition than even the mightiest cities had
          done, and they were of such excellence that he came out first, second, and third.<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.16.2">Thuc. 6.16.2</bibl> and <bibl

            entered seven teams. Cf. Plutarch, <title>Alcibiades</title>: "His horse-breeding was
            famous, among other things, for the number of his racing-chariots. He was the only man,
            not excluding king, who ever entered at Olympia as many as seven. And his winning not
            only first place but second and fourth according to Thucydides—second and third
            according to Euripides—is the highest and most honorable distinction ever won in this
            field. Euripides' Ode contains the following passage: “‘But I will sing thy praises, son
            of Cleinias. A noble thing is victory, noblest of the noble to do what no Greek had ever
            done, be first and second and third in the chariot-race, and go unwearied yet, wreathed
            in the olive of Zeus, to make the herald cry you.’”—(Edmonds, <title>Lyra Graeca</title>
            ii. p. 241.)</note> Besides this, his generosity in the sacrifices and in the other
          expenses connected with the festival was so lavish and magnificent that the public funds
          of all the others<note anchored="true" resp="ed">i.e., the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >*QEWROI/</foreign>, representing the other states.</note> were clearly less than the
          private means of Alcibiades alone. And when he brought his mission to an end he had caused
          the successes of his predecessors to seem petty in comparison with his own and those who
          in his own day had been victors to be no longer objects of emulation, and to future
          breeders of racing-steeds he left behind no possibility of surpassing him. </p>

        <p>With regard to my father's services here in Athens as choregus and gymnasiarch and

            citizens, e.g., the choregia (expenses of the public choruses); the gymnasiarchia
            (defraying of expenses of training athletes for the contests); and the trierarchia (the
            cost of equipping a war-ship and keeping it in service for a year).</note> I am ashamed
          to speak; for so greatly did he excel in all the other public duties that, although those

          anyone should on my father's behalf ask for a vote of thanks even in recognition of
          services as great as his, he would seem to be talking about petty things. </p>

      <div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p> As regards his behavior as a citizen—for neither should this be passed over in
          silence—just as he on his part did not neglect his civic duties, but on the contrary, to
          so great a degree had proved himself a more loyal friend of the people than those who had
          gained the highest repute, that while, as you will find, the others stirred up sedition
          for selfish advantage, he was incurring danger on your behalf. For his devotion to the
          democracy was not that of one who was excluded from the oligarchy, but of one who was
          invited to join it: indeed, time and again when it was in his power as one of a small
          group, not only to rule the rest, but even to dominate them, he refused, choosing rather
          to suffer the city's unjust penalties rather than to be traitor to our form of government.

      <div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>Of the truth of these statements no one would have convinced you as long as you still
          continued to be governed as a democracy; but as it was, the civil conflicts which arose
          clearly showed who were the democrats and who the oligarchs, as well as those who desired
          neither rgime, and those who laid claim to a share in both. In these uprisings your
          enemies twice exiled my father: on the first occasion, no sooner had they got him out of
          the way than they abolished the democracy; on the second, hardly had they reduced you to
          servitude than they condemned him to exile before any other citizen; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart"  >
        <p>so exactly did my father's misfortunes affect the city and he share in her disasters. And
          yet many of the citizens were ill disposed toward him in the belief that he was plotting a
          tyranny; they held this opinion, not on the basis of his deeds, but in the thought that
          all men aspire to this power and that he would have the best chance of attaining it.
          Wherefore you would justly feel the greater gratitude to him because, while he alone of
          the citizens was powerful enough to have this charge<note anchored="true" resp="ed">i.e.,
            of plotting to become a tyrant.</note> brought against him, he was of opinion that as

          loss which of them it is appropriate to mention on the present occasion and which should
          be omitted. For always the plea that has not yet been spoken seems to me of greater
          importance than the arguments which have already been presented to you. And I believe that
          it is obvious to everyone that he must needs be most devoted to the welfare of the city

        <p>Well then, when Athens was prosperous, who of the citizens was more prosperous, more
          admired, or more envied than my father? And when she suffered ill-fortune, who was
          deprived of brighter hopes, or of greater wealth, or of fairer repute? Finally, when the
          Thirty Tyrants established their rule, while the others merely suffered exile from Athens,
          was he not banished from all Greece? Did not the Lacedaemonians and Lysander<note

          suffered at the hands of the same persons, that he was unfortunate when the state was

          fate to live among one's fellow-citizens deprived of civic rights than to dwell an alien
          among foreigners. </p>

        <p>I entreat you, therefore, to aid me and not to suffer me to be despitefully treated by my
          personal enemies, or to be deprived of my fatherland, or to be made notorious by such
          misfortunes. The facts in the case would of themselves justly win for me your pity, even
          if I have not the power by my words to evoke it, since pity truly should be felt for those
          who are unjustly brought to trial, who are fighting for the greatest stakes, whose present
          condition is not in accordance with their own worth or with that of their ancestors,
          seeing that they have been deprived of immense wealth and have experienced life's greatest
          vicissitudes. </p>

        <p> Although I have many reasons for lamenting my fate, I am especially indignant for these
          reasons: first, if I must be punished by this man, who should justly be punished by me;
          second, if I shall lose my civic rights by reason of my father's victory at Olympia, when
          I see other men richly rewarded for such a victory<note anchored="true" resp="ed">For the
            rewards of victory at Olympia cf. <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 36d">Plat. Apol.

        <p>and, in addition, if Teisias, a man who never did the city any good, is to remain
          powerful in the democracy just as he was in the oligarchy, whereas I, who injured neither
          party, am to be ill-treated by both; and finally, if, while in all other matters your
          actions are to be the opposite of those of the Thirty, you shall in regard to me show the
          same spirit as they, and if I, who then lost my fatherland in company with you, shall now
          be deprived of it by you.</p>
