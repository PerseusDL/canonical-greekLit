        <p> Do not be surprised, Philip, that I am going to begin, not with the discourse which is
          to be addressed to you and which is presently to be brought to your attention, but with
          that which I have written about <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
            >Amphipolis</placeName>.<note anchored="true" resp="ed"><placeName
              key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, a city in <placeName
              key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> near the mouth of the Strymon river, conquered
            and colonized by Athenians in <date when="-0437">437 B.C.</date> It was taken by Philip
            in <date when="-0358">358 B.C.</date>, but the war with <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
              >Athens</placeName> was delayed until Philip seized <placeName key="tgn,6004814"
              >Potidaea</placeName>, <date when="-0356">356 B.C.</date></note> For I desire to say a
          few words, by way of preface, about this question, in order that I may make it clear to
          you as well as to the rest of the world that it was not in a moment of folly that I
          undertook to write my address to you, nor because I am under any misapprehension as to the
            infirmity<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Isocrates had now passed his ninetieth
            birthday.</note> which now besets me, but that I was led advisedly and deliberately to
          this resolution. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>
           For when I saw that the war in which you and our city had become involved over
            <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> was proving the source of
          many evils, I endeavored to express opinions regarding this city and territory which, so
          far from being the same as those entertained by your friends, or by the orators among us,
          were as far as possible removed from their point of view. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For they were spurring you on to the war by seconding your covetousness, while I, on the
          contrary, expressed no opinion whatever on the points in controversy, but occupied myself
          with a plea which I conceived to be more than all others conducive to peace, maintaining
          that both you and the Athenians were mistaken about the real state of affairs and that you
          were fighting in support of our interests, and our city in support of your power; for it
          was to your advantage, I urged, that we should possess the territory of <placeName
            key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, while it was in no possible way to our
          advantage to acquire it. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Yes, and I so impressed my hearers by my statement of the case that not one of them
          thought of applauding my oratory or the finish and the purity of my style, as some are
          wont to do, but instead they marvelled at the truth of my arguments, and were convinced
          that only on certain conditions could you and the Athenians be made to cease from your
          contentious rivalry. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>In the first place, you, for your part, will have to be persuaded that the friendship of
          our city would be worth more to you than the revenues which you derive from <placeName
            key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, while <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
            >Athens</placeName> will have to learn, if she can, the lesson that she should avoid
          planting the kind of colonies<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Such as <placeName
              key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, surrounded by warlike tribes.</note>
          which have been the ruin, four or five times over, of those domiciled in them, and should
          seek out for colonization the regions which are far distant from peoples which have a
          capacity for dominion and near those which have been habituated to subjection—such a
          region as, for example, that in which the Lacedaemonians established the colony of
            <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>.<note anchored="true" resp="ed"
              ><placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, in northern <placeName
              key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>. See Grote, <title>Hist.</title> iii. p.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>In the next place, you will have to realize that by formally surrendering this territory
          to us you would in fact still hold it in your power, and would, besides, gain our good
          will, for you would then have as many hostages of ours to guarantee our friendship as we
          should send out settlers into the region of your influence; while someone will have to
          make our own people see that, if we got possession of <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
            >Amphipolis</placeName>, we should be compelled to maintain the same friendly attitude
          toward your policy, because of our colonists there, as we did for the elder Amadocus<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">An alliance was entered into between <placeName
              key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and Amadocus, the powerful Thracian king,
              <date when="-0390">390 B.C.</date> (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 4.8.26">Xen. Hell.
              4.8.26</bibl>).</note> because of our landholders in the <placeName key="tgn,7010345"

      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>
           As I continued to say many things of this tenor, those who heard me were inspired
          with the hope that when my discourse should be published you and the Athenians would bring
          the war to an end, and, having conquered your pride, would adopt some policy for your
          mutual good. Whether indeed they were foolish or sensible in taking this view is a
          question for which they, and not I, may fairly be held to account; but in any case, while
          I was still occupied with this endeavor, you and <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
            >Athens</placeName> anticipated me by making peace before I had completed my discourse;
          and you were wise in doing so, for to conclude the peace, no matter how, was better than
          to continue to be oppressed by the evils engendered by the war. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But although I was in joyful accord with the resolutions which were adopted regarding the
          peace, and was convinced that they would be beneficial, not only to us, but also to you
          and all the other Hellenes, I could not divorce my thought from the possibilities
          connected with this step, but found myself in a state of mind where I began at once to
          consider how the results which had been achieved might be made permanent for us, and how
          our city could be prevented from setting her heart upon further wars, after a short
          interval of peace.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 4.172">Isoc.
              4.172-174</bibl>.</note>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>As I kept going over these questions in my own thoughts, I found that on no other
          condition could <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> remain at peace, unless
          the greatest states of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> should resolve to
          put an end to their mutual quarrels and carry the war beyond our borders into Asia, and
          should determine to wrest from the barbarians the advantages which they now think it
          proper to get for themselves at the expense of the Hellenes. This was, in fact, the course
          which I had already advocated in the <title>Panegyric</title> discourse.<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">See <bibl n="Isoc. 4.17">Isoc. 4.17</bibl>, where almost the
            same words are used.</note>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Having pondered on these matters and come to the conclusion that there could never be
          found a subject nobler than this, of more general appeal, or of greater profit to us all,
          I was moved to write upon it a second time. Yet I did not fail to appreciate my own
          deficiencies; I knew that this theme called for a man, not of my years, but in the full
          bloom of his vigor and with natural endowments far above those of other men; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>and I realized also that it is difficult to deliver two discourses with tolerable success
          upon the same subject, especially when the one which was first published was so written
          that even my detractors imitate and admire it more than do those who praise it to excess.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Nevertheless, disregarding all these difficulties, I have become so ambitious in my old
          age that I have determined by addressing my discourse to you at the same time to set an
          example to my disciples and make it evident to them that to burden our national assemblies
          with oratory and to address all the people who there throng together is, in reality, to
          address no one at all;<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The same sentiment is expressed in
              <bibl n="Isoc. L. 1.6">Isoc. Letter 1.6-7</bibl>. See General Introd. pp. xxxvi.
            ff.</note> that such speeches are quite as ineffectual as the legal codes and
            constitutions<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Possibly a disparagement of Plato's
              <title>Republic</title> and <title>Laws</title> (see Blass, <title>Die attische
              Beredsamkeit,</title> ii. p. 4), but more probably of Isocrates' unfriendly rival,
            Antisthenes, who, according to <bibl n="D. L. 6.1.16">Diog. Laert. 6.1.16</bibl>, wrote
            a work <title>On Law, or the Constitution of a State</title>.</note> drawn up by the

        <p>and, finally, that those who desire, not to chatter empty nonsense, but to further some
          practical purpose, and those who think they have hit upon some plan for the common good,
          must leave it to others to harangue at the public festivals, but must themselves win over
          someone to champion their cause from among men who are capable not only of speech but of
          action and who occupy a high position in the world—if, that is to say, they are to command
          any attention. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> It was with this mind that I chose to address to you what I have to say—not that I
          singled you out to curry your favor, although in truth I would give much to speak
          acceptably to you. It was not, however, with this in view that I came to my decision, but
          rather because I saw that all the other men of high repute were living under the control
          of politics and laws,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">See 127 and General Introd. p.
            xlii.</note> with no power to do anything save what was prescribed, and that,
          furthermore, they were sadly unequal to the enterprise which I shall propose; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>while you and you alone had been granted by fortune free scope both to send ambassadors
          to whom ever you desire and to receive them from whom ever you please, and to say whatever
          you think expedient; and that, besides, you, beyond any of the Hellenes, were possessed of
          both wealth and power, which are the only things in the world that are adapted at once to
          persuade and to compel; and these aids, I think, even the cause which I shall propose to
          you will need to have on its side. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For I am going to advise you to champion the cause of concord among the Hellenes and of a
          campaign against the barbarian; and as persuasion will be helpful in dealing with the
          Hellenes, so compulsion will be useful in dealing with the barbarians. This, then, is the
          general scope of my discourse. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> But I must not shrink from telling you plainly of the discouragements I met with from
          some of my associates; for I think the tale will be somewhat to my purpose. When I
          disclosed to them my intention of sending you an address whose aim was, not to make a
          display, nor to extol the wars which you have carried on—for others will do this—but to
          attempt to urge you to a course of action which is more in keeping with your nature, and
          more noble and more profitable than any which you have hitherto elected to follow, </p>
      </div>
      <div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart">

          must undertake nothing until he finds the Hellenes doing one of two things: either

        <p>For he had two aims, which, though laudable, were not consistent, and could not he

          in behalf of his friends was that the Hellenes were involved in troubles and perils, and,

        <p>So from the mistakes of inadvertence at that time it is easy to draw the lesson that

          if any of the others should be prompted to advise you in favor of the expedition against
          Asia, they would resort to a plea of this kind: that it has been the fortune of all who
          have undertaken a war against the King, without exception, to rise from obscurity to
          brilliant distinction, from poverty to wealth, and from low estate to be masters of many

        <p>I, however, am not going to urge you on such grounds, but by the example of men who were

          that these won as complete a victory in battle over all the forces of the King as if they
          had come to blows with their womenfolk, but that at the very moment when they seemed to be
          masters of the field they failed of success, owing to the impetuosity of Cyrus. For he in
          his exultation rushed in pursuit far in advance of the others; and, being caught in the
          midst of the enemy, was killed. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="91" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But the King, not withstanding that his foes had suffered so severe a loss, felt so
          thorough a contempt for his own forces that he invited Clearchus and the other captains to
          a parley, promising to give them great gifts and to pay their soldiers their wages in full
          and to give them safe convoy home; then, having lured them by such prospects, and having
          assured them by the most solemn pledges known to the Persians, he seized them and put them
          to death, deliberately choosing to outrage the gods rather than risk a clash with our
          soldiers, bereft though they now were of Cyrus's aid. And what challenge could be nobler

          than that which defeated the forces of the King. How, then, since you possess both these

          if Cyrus and Clearchus should succeed, their yoke would be heavier still, but that if the

        <p> It is my belief that, while you ought to honor everyone who has any praise for your past
          accomplishments, you ought to consider that those laud you in the noblest terms who judge
          your nature capable of even greater triumphs, and not those whose discourse has gratified
          you for the moment only, but those who will cause future generations to admire your
          achievements beyond the deeds of any man of the generations that are past. I would like to
          say many things in this strain, but I am not able; the reason why, I have stated more
          often than I ought. </p>

        <p> It remains, then, to summarize what I have said in this discourse, in order that you may
          see in the smallest compass the substance of my counsels. I assert that it is incumbent
          upon you to work for the good of the Hellenes, to reign as king over the Macedonians,<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">The indigenous Macedonians are regarded as half
            barbarians.</note> and to extend your power over the greatest possible number of the
          barbarians. For if you do these things, all men will be grateful to you: the Hellenes for
          your kindness to them; the Macedonians if you reign over them, not like a tyrant, but like
          a king; and the rest of the nations, if by your hands they are delivered from barbaric
          despotism and are brought under the protection of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
            >Hellas</placeName>. </p>

        <p> How well this discourse has been composed with respect to appropriateness and finish of
          style is a question which it is fair to ask my hearers to answer; but that no one could
          give you better advice than this, or advice more suited to the present situation—of this I
          believe that I am well assured.</p>
