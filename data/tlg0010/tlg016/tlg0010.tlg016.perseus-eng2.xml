      <div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Doubtless some of you are astonished that I, who heretofore have observed the
            customs<note anchored="true" resp="ed">In <placeName key="perseus,Sparta"
              >Sparta</placeName> the young were not supposed to appear in public places. Plutarch
            states (<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 25">Plut. Lyc. 25</bibl>) that men were not allowed even in
            the market-place until after they were thirty years old.</note> of the state more
          faithfully, I dare say, than any other of my generation, have now so completely changed
          that I have come forward, in spite of my youth, to offer counsel regarding a subject which
          even our elders hesitate to discuss. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>The fact is that if any of those who are accustomed to address you had spoken in a manner
          worthy of the state, I should strictly have held my peace; but now, since I see that they
          are either seconding the demands of the enemy, or opposing them but feebly, or have kept
          silent altogether, I have risen to set forth my own views on this subject, feeling that it
          would be disgraceful if by keeping the place appropriate to my years I should allow the
          state to pass measures unworthy of itself. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Moreover, I think that although on other matters it may be proper for men of my age to
          keep silent, yet on the question of war it is fitting that they most of all should give
          counsel who will also have the greatest part in the dangers, especially since the power to
          judge of what ought to be done is an endowment common to all of us. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For if it were established that older men always know what is best, while the younger are
          never correct in their views, it would be right to exclude us from giving counsel; but
          since it is not by the number of our years that we differ in wisdom from one another, but
          by our natural endowments and by our cultivation of them, why should you not make trial of
          both the young and the old, in order that you may be in a position to choose from all
          courses which are proposed that which is the most expedient? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>I am amazed at those who think that we are fit to command ships of war and to lead armies
          in the field,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Archidamus had commanded Spartan armies in
            370 and 367. See <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.4.17">Xen. Hell. 6.4.17</bibl> and vii. 1.
            28.</note> where bad judgement on our part would involve the state in many grave
          disasters, and yet do not think that we ought to express our views on matters which you
          are about to decide, wherein if we proved to be right we should benefit you all, while if,
          on the other hand, we failed of your assent we should ourselves perhaps suffer in
          reputation, but should not in any way impair the commonwealth. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> It is not, I assure you, because I am ambitious to be an orator, nor because I am
          prepared to change my former mode of life that I have spoken as I have about these things,
          but because I want to urge you not to reject any time of life, but to seek among all ages
          for the man who can offer good advice on the problems which now confront us; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>for never since we have dwelt in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> has
          any war or any peril come upon us in which so much has been at stake as in this question
          which we are now assembled to discuss. For while in times past we fought that we might
          have dominion over the other states, now we must fight that we ourselves may not be forced
          to do their bidding—which is proof of a free spirit, to preserve which no hardship on
          earth is too great to endure, not for us alone, but for all others as well who have not
          renounced every claim to manhood but still make even slight pretensions to courage. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> As for myself, at any rate, if I may speak my own mind, I had rather die this moment for
          not complying with the dictates of the foe than live many times my allotted span of life
          at the price of voting what the Thebans demand. For I should feel disgraced, I who am
          descended from Heracles,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The Spartan kings claimed descent
            from Heracles <bibl n="Isoc. 4.62">Isoc. 4.62</bibl>.</note> who am the son of the
          ruling king and likely myself to attain to this honor,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"
            >Archidamus became king after the death of Agesilaus in <date when="-0361">361
              B.C.</date></note> if I did not strive with all the strength that is in me to prevent
          this territory, which our fathers left to us, from becoming the possession of our slaves.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And I expect you also to share my feelings when you reflect that, while until the present
          day we seem to have been unfortunate in our contest with the Thebans,<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">Since the battle of Leuctra.</note> and to have been overcome in body because
          of the mistakes of our leader,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cleombrotus the king was
            partly blamed for the Spartan defeat at Leuctra.</note> yet up to this moment we possess
          our spirits unconquered; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>but that if through fear of the dangers which now threaten us we relinquish anything that
          is ours, we shall justify the boasts of the Thebans, and erect against ourselves a trophy
          far more imposing and conspicuous than that which was raised at Leuctra; for the one will
          stand as a memorial of our ill-fortune; the other, of our abject spirit. Let no man,
          therefore, persuade you to fasten such a disgrace upon the state. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> And yet our allies<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Especially the Corinthians. See
            Introduction.</note> have been only too zealous in advising you that you must give up
            <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and make peace. Because of this
          they merit your indignation far more than those who revolted<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">The Arcadians had joined the Thebans in invading <placeName
              key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. The Argives, Eleans, and Achaeans had also
            forsaken <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and gone over partly or
            wholly to the Thebans.</note> from you at the beginning. For the latter, when they had
          forsaken your friendship, destroyed their own cities, plunging them into civil strife and
          massacres and vicious forms of government.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Such
            disturbances and changes of government took place about this time in <placeName
              key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Argos"
              >Argos</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>, <placeName

              Hell. 7.1-4</bibl>. By vicious forms of government Archidamus probably refers to the
            democracies which in various places had been set up instead of the earlier
            oligarchies.</note> These men, on the other hand, come here to inflict injury upon us;
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>for they are trying to persuade us to throw away in one brief hour the glory which our
          forefathers amid manifold dangers during the course of seven hundred years<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">A round number for the period between <date when="-1104">1104
              B.C.</date>, the traditional date when the sons of Heracles took <placeName

              when="-0366">366 B.C.</date></note> acquired and bequeathed to us—a disaster more
          humiliating to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and more terrible than
          any other they could ever have devised. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>So far do they go in their selfish greed, so great is the cowardice which they impute to
          us, that they, who have time and again called upon us to make war in defense of their own
            territory,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Especially <placeName key="perseus,Corinth"
              >Corinth</placeName> and Phlius. See <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 4.4.7">Xen. Hell.

            key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, but, in order that they may themselves
          cultivate their lands in security, seek to convince us that we ought to yield to the enemy
          a portion of our own; and, besides all that, they threaten that if we do not comply with
          these terms, they will make a separate peace. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For my part, I do not think that our risk without their alliance will be as much more
          serious for us as it will be more glorious and splendid and notable in the eyes of all
          mankind; for to endeavor to preserve ourselves and to prevail over our enemies, not
          through the aid of others, but through our own powers, is in keeping with the past
          achievements of our state. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Although I have never been fond of oratory, having in fact always thought that those who
          cultivate the power of speech are somewhat lacking in capacity for action,<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">An allusion to the traditional Spartan fondness for brevity
            and distrust of eloquence.</note> yet at the moment there is nothing I should value more
          than the ability to speak as I desire about the question now before us; for in the present
          crisis I am confident that with this aid I could render a very great service to the state.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> First, I think that I ought to explain to you in what way we acquired <placeName
            key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, and for what reasons you settled in the
          Peloponnesus—you who from of old are Dorians. And the reason why I shall go back to remote
          times is that you may understand why your enemies are trying to rob you of this country,
          which you acquired, no less than <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>
          itself, with a just title. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> When Heracles had put off this life and from being mortal became a god, his sons at
          first went on divers wanderings and faced many perils because of the power of their
            enemies;<note anchored="true" resp="ed">For the return of the the sons of Heracles and
            details connected therewith see <bibl n="Apollod. 2.8.2">Apollod. 2.8.2-4</bibl>, and
            Frazer's notes on this passage (Loeb Classical Library, Vol.I). Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 4.54"
              >Isoc. 4.54-58</bibl> and notes.</note> but after the death of Eurystheus they fixed
          their habitation among the Dorians. In the third generation thereafter they came to
            <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, desiring to consult the oracle about
          certain matters. Apollo, however, made them no answer to the questions which they asked,

      <div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Searching into the meaning of the oracle, they found, first, that <placeName

          in keeping with <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and with our
          achievements in the past. For not every people can adopt the same measures in the same

          deliverance at all costs, but if to “safety” we cannot add “with honor,” then for us death
