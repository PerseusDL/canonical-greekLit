        <p>For we are assembled here to deliberate about War and Peace, which exercise the greatest
          power over the life of man, and regarding which those who are correctly advised must of
          necessity fare better than the rest of the world. Such, then, is the magnitude of the

          your private affairs you abhor those who practice this art, in your public affairs you are
          not so minded towards them; on the contrary, while you denounce those who welcome and
          enjoy the society of such men, you yourselves make it manifest that you place greater

        <p> Indeed, you have caused the orators to practice and study, not what will be advantageous
          to the state, but how they may discourse in a manner pleasing to you. And it is to this
          kind of discourse that the majority of them have resorted also at the present time, since
          it has become plain to all that you will be better pleased with those who summon you to
          war than with those who counsel peace; </p>

            Peloponnesian War, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> frequently
            disciplined recalcitrant confederate states by expelling their citizens and settling
            Athenians on their lands. Such settlements were called cleruchies. When <placeName

            not be repeated. But the jingoistic orators advocated nothing less than the restoration
            of the former empire with all its powers and practices.</note> while the latter hold
          forth no such hope, insisting rather that we must have peace and not crave great
          possessions contrary to justice,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The state which seizes and
            holds foreign possessions is a robber. Isocrates throughout this discourse proposes to

          content with those we have<note anchored="true" resp="ed">A proverbial tag. Cf. <bibl

      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For we are so dependent on our hopes and so insatiate in seizing what seems to be our
          advantage that not even those who possess the greatest fortunes are willing to rest
          satisfied with them but are always grasping after more and so risking the loss of what
          they have. Wherefore we may well be anxious lest on the present occasion also we may be
          subject to this madness. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For some of us appear to me to be over zealously bent on war, as though having heard, not
          from haphazard counsellors, but from the gods, that we are destined to succeed in all our
          campaigns and to prevail easily over our foes. But people of intelligence, when dealing
          with matters about which they have knowledge, ought not to take counsel—for this is
          superfluous—but to act as men who are already resolved what to do, whereas, in dealing
          with matters about which they take counsel, they ought not to think that they have exact
          knowledge of what the result will be, but to be minded towards these contingencies as men
          who indeed exercise their best judgement, but are not sure what the future may hold in
            store.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">This some what wordy passsage in which the orator
            becomes the philosopher reflects a fundamental idea of his pedagogy: There can be no
            exact science or knowledge of what to do in all contingencies and relations of life; the
            best that we can do is to develop sound, not infalliable, judgement in dealing with
            them. See General Introd. p. xxvii, Isocrates, Vol. I., L.C.L., and <bibl
              n="Isoc. 15.184">Isoc. 15.184</bibl>, note.</note>

        <p> You, however, do neither the one thing nor the other, but are in the utmost confusion of
          mind. For you have come together as if it were your business to select the best course
          from all that are proposed; nevertheless, as though you had clear knowledge of what must
          be done, you are not willing to listen to any except those who speak for your pleasure.

      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And yet, if you really desired to find out what is advantageous to the state, you ought
          to give your attention more to those who oppose your views than to those who seek to
          gratify you, knowing well that of the orators who come before you here, those who say what
          you desire are able to delude you easily—since what is spoken to win favor clouds your
          vision of what is best—whereas those who advise you without regard to your pleasure can
          affect you in no such way, </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>since they could not convert you to their way of thinking until they have first made
          clear what is for your advantage. But, apart from these considerations, how can men wisely
          pass judgement on the past or take counsel for the future unless they examine and compare
          the arguments of opposing speakers, themselves giving an unbiased hearing<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 15.21">Isoc. 15.21</bibl>; <bibl

      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> But I marvel that the older men no longer recall and that the younger have not been told
          by anyone that the orators who exhort us to cling fast to peace have never caused us to
          suffer any misfortune whatsoever, whereas those who lightly espouse war have already
          plunged us into many great disasters. However, we have no memory for these facts but are
          always ready, without in the least advancing our own welfare, to man triremes, to levy
          war-taxes, and to lend aid to the campaigns of others or wage war against them, as chance
          may determine, as if imperilling the interests, not of our own, but of a foreign state.

      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And the cause of this condition of affairs is that, although you ought to be as much
          concerned about the business of the commonwealth as about your own, you do not feel the

          regarding your private business you seek out as counsellors men who are your superiors in
          intelligence, but whenever you deliberate on the business of the state you distrust and
