      <div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> This trial, men of the jury, is an important one for me. For I have at stake, not only a large sum of money, but also my reputation—for I risk being thought to covet what justly belongs to another; and that is what gives me the greatest concern. For sufficient property will be left to me even if I am defrauded of this sum; but if I should be thought to be laying claim to so large a sum of money without just cause, I should have an evil reputation as long as I live.<note resp="editor">The plea that the litigant’s reputation is at stake is commonplace in the forensic orations; cf. the speeches of Lysias.</note> </p>
      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
      <p> The greatest difficulty of all, men of the jury, is that I have adversaries of the character of the defendants here. For contracts with the managers of banks are entered into without witnesses, and any who are wronged by them are obliged to bring suit against men who have many friends, handle much money, and have a reputation for honesty because of their profession. In spite of these considerations I think I shall make it clear to all that I have been defrauded of my money by Pasion. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
       <p> I shall relate the facts to you from the beginning as well as I can. My father, men of the jury, is Sopaeus; all who sail to the Pontus know that his relations with Satyrus<note resp="editor">Satyrus was king of Bosporus (<date from="-0407" to="-0393" >407-393 B.C.</date>); cf. <bibl n="Lys. 16.4">Lys. 16.4</bibl>.</note> are so intimate that he is ruler of an extensive territory and has charge of that ruler’s entire forces. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Having heard reports both of this state and of the other lands where Greeks live, I desired to travel abroad. And so my father loaded two ships with grain,<note resp="editor">Athens imported great quantities of grain from the Pontus; cf. <bibl n="Dem. 20.31">Dem. 20.31-35</bibl>.</note> gave me money, and sent me off on a trading expedition and at the same time to see the world.<note resp="editor">Cf. <bibl n="Hdt. 1.29">Hdt. 1.29</bibl> where Solon leaves Athens “to see the world” (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ θεωρίαν</foreign>).</note> Pythodorus, the Phoenician, introduced Pasion to me and I opened an account at his bank. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Later on, as a result of slander which reached Satyrus to the effect that my father was
          plotting against the throne and that I was associating with the exiles, Satyrus arrested
          my father and sent orders to citizens of Pontus in residence here in Athens to take
          possession of my money and to bid me to return and, if I refused to obey, to demand of you
          my extradition. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>When I found myself in difficulties so embarrassing, men of the jury, I related my
          troubles to Pasion; for I was on such intimate terms with him that I had the greatest
          confidence in him, not only in matters of money, but in everything else as well. I thought
          that, if I should yield control of all my money, I should run the risk, in case my father
          met with misfortune, after having been deprived of my money both here in Athens and at
          home, of becoming utterly destitute; and that, if I should acknowledge the existence of
          money here, yet fail to surrender it at Satyrus’ command, I should create the most serious
          grounds of complaint against myself and my father in the mind of Satyrus. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>On deliberation we decided that it would be best to agree to comply with all of Satyrus’
          demands and to surrender the money whose existence was known, but with respect to the
          funds on deposit with Pasion we should not only deny their existence but also make it
          appear that I had borrowed at interest both from Pasion and from others,<note resp="editor">e.g., Stratocles, cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 17.35">Isoc.
              17.35-36</bibl>.</note> and to do everything which was likely to make them believe
          that I had no money. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> At that time, men of the jury, I thought that Pasion was giving me all this advice
          because of goodwill toward me; but when I had arranged matters with the representatives of
          Satyrus, I perceived that he had designs on my property. For when I wished to recover my
          money and sail to Byzantium, Pasion thought a most favorable opportunity had come his way;
          for the sum of money on deposit with him was large and of sufficient value to warrant a
          shameless act, and I, in the presence of many listeners, had denied that I possessed
          anything, and everybody had seen that money was being demanded of me and that I was
          acknowledging that I was indebted to others also. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Besides this, men of the jury, he was of opinion that if I attempted to remain here, I
          should be handed over by Athens to Satyrus, and if I should go anywhere else, he would be
          indifferent to my complaints, and if I should sail to the Pontus, I should be put to death
          along with my father; it was on the strength of these calculations that Pasion decided to
          defraud me of my money. And although to me he pretended that for the moment he was short
          of funds and would not be able to repay me, yet when I, wishing to ascertain exactly the
          truth, sent Philomelus and Menexenus to him to demand my property, he denied to them that
          he had anything belonging to me. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Thus beset on every side by misfortunes so dire, what, think you, was my state of mind?
          If I kept silent I should be defrauded of my money by Pasion here; if I should make this
          complaint, I was none the more likely to recover it and I should bring myself and my
          father into the greatest disrepute with Satyrus. The wisest course, therefore, as I
          thought, was to keep silent. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> After this, men of the jury, messengers arrived with the news that my father had been
          released and that Satyrus was so repentant of all that had occurred that he had bestowed
          upon my father pledges of his confidence of the most sweeping kind, and had given him
          authority even greater than he formerly possessed and had chosen my sister as his son’s
          wife. When Pasion learned this and understood that I would now bring action openly about
          my property, he spirited away his slave Cittus, who had knowledge of our financial
          transactions. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And when I went to him and demanded the surrender of Cittus, because I believed that this
          slave could furnish the clearest proof of my claim, Pasion made the most outrageous
          charge, that I and Menexenus had bribed and corrupted Cittus as he sat at his
          banking-table and received six talents of silver from him. And that there might be neither
          examination nor testimony under torture on these matters, he asserted that it was we who
          had spirited away the slave and had brought a counter-charge against himself with a demand
          that this slave, whom we ourselves had spirited away, be produced. And while he was making
          this plea and protesting and weeping, he dragged me before the Polemarch<note resp="editor">The Polemarch was one of the nine archons of Athens. He had
            supervision of the affairs of foreigners and resident-aliens.</note> with a demand for
          bondsmen, and he did not release me until I had furnished bondsmen in the sum of six
          talents. Please summon for me witnesses to these facts.</p> 
        <p rend="align(center)"><label>Witnesses</label></p> 
      </div>
      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> You have heard the witnesses, men of the jury; and I, who had already lost part of my
          money and with regard to the rest was under the most infamous charges, left Athens for the
          Peloponnesus to investigate for myself. But Menexenus found the slave here in the city,
          and having seized him demanded that he give testimony under torture<note resp="editor">The evidence of slaves could only be given under torture; cf. §54.</note>
          about both the deposit and the charge brought by his master. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Pasion, however, reached such a pitch of audacity that he secured the release of the
          slave on the ground that he was a freeman and, utterly devoid of shame and of fear, he
          claimed as a freeman and prevented the torture of a person who, as he alleged, had been
          stolen from him by us and had given us all that money. But the crowning impudence of all
          was this—that when Menexenus compelled Pasion to give security for the slave before the
          Polemarch, he gave bond for him in the sum of seven talents. Let witnesses to these facts
          take the stand.</p>
        <p rend="align(center)"><label>Witnesses</label></p>
      </div>
      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> After he had acted in this way, men of the jury, Pasion, believing that his past conduct
          had clearly been in error and thinking he could rectify the situation by his subsequent
          acts, came to us and asserted that he was ready to surrender the slave for torture. We
          chose questioners and met in the temple of Hephaestus.<note resp="editor">The
            Hephaisteion, in Athens, which has long been popularly but erroneously called the
            Theseum.</note> And I demanded that they flog and rack the slave, who had been
          surrendered, until they were of opinion that he was telling the truth. But Pasion here
          asserted that they had not been chosen as torturers, and bade them make oral interrogation
          of the slave if they wished any information. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Because of our disagreement the examiners refused to put the slave to torture themselves,
          but decreed that Pasion should surrender him to me. But Pasion was so anxious to avoid the
          employment of torture that he refused to obey them in respect to the surrender of the
          slave, but declared that he was ready to restore to me the money if they should pronounce
          judgement against him. Please call for me witnesses to these facts.</p>
        <p rend="align(center)"><label>Witnesses</label></p>
      </div>
      <div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> When, as a result of these meetings, men of the jury, all declared that Pasion was
          guilty of wrong-doing and of scandalous conduct (since, in the first place, it was Pasion
          himself who had spirited away the slave who, so I had asserted, had knowledge of the
          money-dealings, although he accused us of having concealed him, and next, when the slave
          was arrested, had prevented him from giving testimony under torture on the ground that he
          was a freeman, and finally, after this, having surrendered him as a slave and having
          chosen questioners, he nominally gave orders that he be tortured but in point of fact
          forbade it), Pasion, I say, understanding that there was no possibility of escape for
          himself if he came before you, sent a messenger to beg me to meet him in a sanctuary. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And when we had come to the Acropolis, he covered his head and wept, saying that he had
          been compelled to deny the debt because of lack of funds, but that he would try to repay
          me in a short time. He begged me to forgive him and to keep his misfortune secret, in
          order that he, as a receiver of deposits, might not be shown to have been culpable in such
          matters. In the belief that he repented of his past conduct I yielded, and bade him to
          devise a method, of any kind he wished, that his affairs might be in order and I receive
          back my money. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Two days later we met again and solemnly pledged each other to keep the affair secret, a
          pledge which he failed to keep, as you yourselves will learn as my story proceeds, and he
          agreed to sail with me to the Pontus and there pay me back the gold, in order that he
          might settle our contract at as great a distance as possible from Athens, and that no one
          here might know the nature of our settlement, and also that on his return from the Pontus
          he might say anything he pleased; but in the event that he should not fulfil these
          obligations, he proposed to entrust to Satyrus an arbitration on stated terms<note resp="editor">For arbitration under terms or on certain conditions cf. also <bibl n="Isoc. 18.10">Isoc. 18.10</bibl> and <bibl n="Dem. 49">Dem. 49</bibl>, <title>Against Spudias</title>, fn. 1. In such cases the arbitrator had no
            discretionary power. Cf. Jebb’s <title>Attic Orators</title> ii. p. 234.</note> which
          would permit Satyrus to condemn Pasion to pay the original sum, and half as much in
          addition. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>When he had drawn up this agreement in writing we brought to the Acropolis Pyron, of
            Pherae,<note resp="editor">In Thessaly.</note> who frequently sailed to the
          Pontus, and placed the agreement in his custody, stipulating that if we should come to a
          satisfactory settlement with each other, he should burn the memorandum; otherwise, he was
          to deliver it to Satyrus. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> The questions in dispute between ourselves, men of the jury, had been settled in this
          manner; but Menexenus was so enraged because of the charge which Pasion had brought
          against him also, that he brought an action for libel against him and demanded the
          surrender of Cittus, asking that Pasion, if guilty of falsification, should suffer the
          same penalty which he himself would have incurred for the same acts. And Pasion, men of
          the jury, begged me to appease Menexenus, saying it would be of no advantage to himself
          if, after having sailed to the Pontus, he should pay the money in accordance with the
          terms of the agreement, and then should all the same be made a laughing-stock in Athens;

        <p>for the slave, if put to the torture, would testify to the truth of everything. I for my
          part, however, asked him to take any action he pleased as to Menexenus, but to carry out
          his agreements with me. At that time he was in a humble mood, for he did not know what to
          do in his plight. For not only was he in a state of fear in regard to the torture and the
          impending suit, but also with respect to the memorandum, lest Menexenus should obtain
          possession of it. </p>

        <p>And being embarrassed and finding no other means of relief, he bribed the slaves of the
          alien Pyron and falsified the memorandum which Satyrus was to receive in case he did not
          come to an agreement with me. No sooner had he accomplished this than he became the most
          impudent of all men and declared that he would not sail with me to the Pontus and that no
          contract at all existed between us, and he demanded that the memorandum be opened in the
          presence of witnesses. Why need I say more to you, men of the jury? For it was discovered
          to have been written in the memorandum that Pasion was released of all claims on my part!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Well, all the facts in the case I have told you as accurately as I could. But I think,
          men of the jury, that Pasion will base his defense on the falsified memorandum, and will
          especially rely on its contents. Do you, therefore, give your attention to me; for I think
          that from these very contents I shall reveal to you his rascality. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Consider the matter first in this way. When we gave to the alien, Pyron, the agreement
          by which Pasion, as he claims, is released from my demands, but as I contend, I was to
          have received back the gold from him, we bade the alien, in case we arrived at an
          understanding with each other, to burn the memorandum; otherwise, to give it to Satyrus,
          and that this was stated both of us agree. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And yet, men of the jury, what possessed us to stipulate that the memorandum should be
          given to Satyrus in case of our failure to come to terms, if Pasion had already been freed
          of my claims and our business had been concluded? On the contrary, it is clear that we had
          made this agreement because there yet remained matters which Pasion had to settle with me
          in accordance with the memorandum. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>In the next place, men of the jury, I can give you the reasons why he agreed to repay me
          the gold; for when we had been cleared of the false accusations lodged with Satyrus, and
          Pasion had been unable to spirit away Cittus, who had knowledge of my deposit, he
          understood that </p>
      </div>
      <div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>if he should deliver his slave to torture, he would be convicted of an act of rascality,
          and, on the other hand, if he failed to do so, he would lose his case<note resp="editor">The refusal by an accused master to submit his slave for testimony under
            torture was used by an adversary as practically a confession of guilt; cf. <bibl
              n="Antiph. 5.38">Antiph. 5.38</bibl> and <bibl n="Antiph. 6.27">Antiph.
            6.27</bibl>.</note>; he wished, therefore, to reach a settlement with me in person. Bid
          him show you what gain I had in view, or what danger I feared, that I dropped my charges
          against him. But if he can show you nothing of the kind, would you not with greater
          justice trust me rather than him in the matter of the memorandum? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Furthermore, men of the jury, this too is easy for all to see—that whereas I, the
          plaintiff, if I distrusted the sufficiency of my proofs, could drop the prosecution even
          without entering into any agreement, yet Pasion, on account both of the examination of his
          slave under torture and the suits lodged with you, could not possibly free himself from
          his risks when he wished except by gaining the consent of me, the complainant. In
          consequence, I was not obliged to make an agreement about the dismissal of my charges, but
          it was necessary for him to do so about the repayment of my money. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Besides, it would have been a preposterous state of affairs if, before the memorandum had
          been drawn up, I should have had so little confidence in my case as not only to drop the
          charges against Pasion, but also to make an agreement concerning these charges and, after
          I had drawn up such written proof against myself, should then have desired to bring the
          case before you. And yet who would plan so foolishly in regard to his own interests? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But here is the strongest proof of all that in the agreement Pasion was not absolved from
          his debt, but on the contrary had agreed to repay the gold: when Menexenus lodged his suit
          against him, which was before the memorandum had been tampered with, Pasion sent
            Agyrrhius<note resp="editor">An influential man in public affairs; cf. <bibl
              n="Andoc. 1.133">Andoc. 1.133</bibl>.</note>, a friend of both of us, to beg that I
          either appease Menexenus or annul the agreement I had made with himself. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And yet, men of the jury, do you think that he would desire the annulment of this
          agreement, which he could use to convict us of falsehood? At any rate, this was not what
          he was saying after they had altered the memorandum; on the contrary, in all details he
          appealed to the agreement and ordered the memorandum to be opened. In proof that Pasion at
          first was eager for the suppression of the agreement I will produce Agyrrhius himself as
          witness. Please take the stand.</p>

      <div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> So then, the fact that we made the agreement, not as Pasion will try to explain, but as
          I have related to you, I think has been sufficiently established. And it should not
          occasion surprise, men of the jury, that he falsified the memorandum, not only for the
          reason that there have been numerous frauds of such nature, but because some of Pasion’s
          friends have been guilty of conduct far worse. For instance, is there anyone who is
          ignorant that Pythodorus, called “the shop-keeper,”<note resp="editor">Cf.
              <bibl n="Dem. 54.7">Dem. 54.7</bibl>.</note> whose words and acts are all in Pasion’s

          been cast by the Council? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And yet when a man who, for petty gain and at the peril of his life, has the effrontery
          to open secretly the urns that had been stamped by the prytanes<note resp="editor">The Prytanes (Presidents), a committee of 50, one-tenth part of the Council of

          kept on the Acropolis, why should there be surprise that men, who hoped to make so great a

          gaining their ends either by the bribery of his slaves or by some other means in their
          power? On this point, however, I do not know what more I need say. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Already Pasion has tried to persuade certain persons that I had no money at all here,
          asserting that I had borrowed three hundred staters<note resp="editor">The
            stater was a coin of a certain weight. The Persian gold stater, or daric, was worth a
            little more than a pound sterling. These were probably Cyzicene staters of Asia
            Minor.</note> from Stratocles. It is worth while, therefore, that you should hear me
          also on these matters, in order that you may understand how flimsy is the proof which
          encourages him to try to defraud me of my money. Now, men of the jury, when Stratocles was
          about to sail for Pontus, I, wishing to get as much of my money out of that country as
          possible, asked Stratocles to leave with me his own gold and on his arrival in Pontus to
          collect its equivalent from my father there, </p>
      </div>
      <div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>as I thought it would be highly advantageous not to jeopardize my money by the risks of a
          voyage, especially as the Lacedaemonians were then masters of the sea. For Pasion, then, I
          do not think that this is any indication that I had no money here; but for me my dealings
          with Stratocles will constitute the strongest proof that I had gold on deposit with
          Pasion. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For when Stratocles inquired of me who would repay him in case my father failed to carry
          out my written instructions, and if, on his return, he should not find me here, I
          introduced Pasion to him, and Pasion himself agreed to repay him both the principal and
          the accrued interest. And yet if Pasion had not had on deposit some money belonging to me,
          do you think he would so readily have become my guarantor for so large a sum? Witnesses,

          confession that I owed him three hundred drachmas, and also that I had allowed Hippoladas,
          my guest and friend, to borrow from him.<note resp="editor">This is cited to

        <p>As for me, men of the jury, since I was involved in the difficulties which I have related

          the envoys from Pontus, and finding myself without any means unless I could secretly
          retain in my possession the money on deposit with Pasion, I did, I admit, acknowledge a
          debt due him of three hundred drachmas and that in other respects I behaved and spoke in a

          first those who knew that I had received much money from Pontus; next, those who saw me as
          a patron of Pasion’s bank, and, besides, the persons from whom at that time I bought more

        <p> Pasion himself, moreover—in effect, at least—I will present as corroborating these
          statements. An information had been laid by a certain party against a trading-ship, upon
          which I had lent a large sum of money, as belonging to a man of Delos.<note resp="editor">The speaker had lent money on the cargo of the merchant-man
            which apparently was denounced as being contraband for some reason.</note> When I

          blackmail so influenced the Council that at first I almost was put to death without a
          trial; finally, however, they were persuaded to accept bondsmen from me. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="43" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And Philip, who was my father’s guest-friend, was summoned and appeared, but took to
          flight in alarm at the magnitude of the danger; Pasion, however, furnished for me
            Archestratus,<note resp="editor">The banker Archestratus was the former
            master of Pasion.</note> the banker, as surety for seven talents. And yet if he stood to
          lose but a small sum and had known that I possessed no funds here, surely he would not
          have become my surety for so large an amount. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="44" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But it is obvious that Pasion called in the three hundred drachmas as a favor to me, and
          that he became my surety for seven talents because he judged that the gold on deposit with
          him was a sufficient guarantee. That, therefore, I had a large sum of money here and that
          it was deposited in his bank I have not only proved to you from Pasion’s acts but you have
          also heard it from the others who know the facts. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="45" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> It seems to me, men of the jury, that you would best decide upon the questions at issue
          if you should call to mind that period and the situation in which our affairs stood when I
          sent Menexenus and Philomelus to claim the deposit and Pasion for the first time had the
          hardihood to deny its existence. You find, in fact, that my father had been arrested and
          deprived of all his property, and that I was unable, because of the embarrassment in which
          I found myself, either to remain here or to sail to the Pontus. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="46" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And yet, which is the more reasonable supposition—that I, involved in misfortunes so
          great brought unjust charges against Pasion or that he, because of the magnitude of our
          misfortunes and the large sum of money involved, was tempted to defraud us? But what man
          ever went so far in chicanery as, with his own life in jeopardy, to plot against the
          possessions of others?<note resp="editor">For the same argument cf. <bibl
              n="Isoc. 21.14">Isoc. 21.14</bibl>.</note> With what hope or with what intent would I
          have unjustly proceeded against Pasion? Was it my thought that, in fear of my influence,
          he would forthwith give me money? But neither the one nor the other of us was in such a
          situation. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="47" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Or was I of opinion that by bringing the matter to issue in court I should have greater
          influence with you than Pasion, even contrary to justice—I, who was not even preparing to
          remain in Athens, since I feared that Satyrus would demand of you my extradition? Or was I
          going to act so that, without accomplishing anything, I should make a personal enemy of
          the man with whom, as it happened, of all the inhabitants of Athens, I was on terms of
          greatest intimacy? Who of you, I ask, would think it right to condemn me as being guilty
          of such folly and stupidity? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="48" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> It is also right, men of the jury, that you should note the absurdity and the
          incredibility of the arguments which Pasion on each occasion undertook to present. For
          when my situation was such that, even if he acknowledged that he was defrauding me of my
          money, I could not have exacted the penalty from him, it is then that he accuses me of
          trying to make unjust claims; but when I had been declared innocent of the slanderous
          charges lodged with Satyrus and all thought that he would lose his suit, it is then that
          he says I renounced all claims against him. And yet how could anything be more illogical
          than this? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="49" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> But, you may say, perhaps it is on these matters only, and not on the others, that he
          obviously contradicts himself in both words and deeds. Yet he is the man who, though he
          alleged that the slave whom he himself had spirited away had been enslaved by us, yet
          listed this same person in his property-schedule as a slave along with his other servants,
          and then when Menexenus demanded that this slave give testimony under torture, Pasion
          brought about his release on the ground that he was a freeman! </p>
      </div>
      <div n="50" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Furthermore, while he himself was defrauding me of my deposit, he had the impudence to
          accuse us of having six talents from his bank. And yet when a man did not hesitate to lie
          in matters so obvious to everybody, how can he be believed about matters transacted
          between us two alone? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="51" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Finally, men of the jury, although he had agreed to sail to the country of Satyrus and
          to do whatever he decreed, he deceived me even in this; he refused to sail himself in
          spite of my frequent solicitations, but sent Cittus instead. On his arrival Cittus alleged
          that he was a freeman, a Milesian by birth, and that Pasion had sent him to furnish
          information about the money. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="52" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>When Satyrus had heard us both, he did not wish to render a decision concerning contracts
          made in Athens, especially since Pasion was absent and not likely to comply with his
          decision; but he believed so strongly that I was being wronged that he called together the
          ship owners<note resp="editor">Of the Athenian colony at Bosporus.</note> and
          asked them to assist me and not suffer me to be wronged. And he wrote a letter to the city

        <p> Although, men of the jury, my claims to justice are so many, I think that the strongest
          proof that Pasion defrauded me of my money is this—that he refused to surrender for
          torture the slave who knew about the deposit. And yet, in respect to contracts where banks
          are concerned, what stronger proof could there be than this? For witnesses certainly we do

        <p>I see that in private and public causes you judge that nothing is more deserving of

          torture clearly shows which party is telling the truth.<note resp="editor">A
            commonplace; cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 6.25">Antiph. 6.25</bibl>.</note> Pasion, being aware
          of this, wished that in this affair you should judge by conjecture rather than know the
          exact truth. For he certainly would not be able to say that he was likely to be at a
          disadvantage if torture should be used and that for this reason the surrender of his slave
          could not reasonably be expected of him. </p>

          held firm in his denials, he would be free and have a share of my money which his master
          had taken. In spite of the fact that he was to have so great an advantage Pasion,
          conscious of his guilty deeds, submitted to stand suit and to rest under the other
