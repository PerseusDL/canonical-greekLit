      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>for we shall find that men of ambition and greatness of soul not only are desirous of

        <p>Expenditure of money can effect nothing of this kind, but is an indication of wealth

          some by exhibiting their strength and others their artistic skill, win for themselves
          greater honor. But the spoken words which should adequately recount the deeds of Evagoras
          would make his virtues never to be forgotten among all mankind. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Now other writers should have praised those who in their own time had proved themselves
          good men, to the end that those who have the ability to glorify the deeds of their
          contemporaries, by speaking in the presence of those who knew the facts might have
          employed the truth concerning them, and also that the younger generation might with
          greater emulation have striven for virtue, knowing well that they would be praised more
          highly than those whom they have excelled in merit. </p>

            and the Argonauts.</note> celebrated in song and tragedy, and yet foresees that even if
          he himself surpass their valorous achievements he will never be thought worthy of such
          praise? The cause of this is envy, which has this as its only good—it is the greatest evil
          to those who feel it. For some are so ungenerous by nature that they would listen more
          gladly to the praise of men of whose existence they are uncertain rather than of those who
          may have been their own benefactors. </p>

        <p>Men of intelligence, however, should not let themselves be enslaved by men whose minds

          fellows to hear about those whom we are in duty bound to praise, especially since we are
          aware that progress is made, not only in the arts, but in all other activities, not
          through the agency of those that are satisfied with things as they are, but through those
          who correct, and have the courage constantly to change, anything which is not as it should

        <p> I am fully aware that what I propose to do is difficult—to eulogize in prose the virtues
          of a man. The best proof is this: Those who devote themselves to philosophy<note

            in Isocrates see the General Introd., Vol. I, p. xxvi.</note> venture to speak on many
          subjects of every kind, but no one of them has ever attempted to compose a discourse on
          such a theme.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Prose encomia existed before this time, but
            they were mostly exercises on mythical subjects written by Sophists.</note> And I can
          make much allowance for them. For to the poets is granted the use of many embellishments
          of language, </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>since they can represent the gods as associating with men, conversing with and aiding in
          battle whomsoever they please, and they can treat of these subjects not only in
          conventional expressions, but in words now exotic, now newly coined, and now in figures of
          speech, neglecting none, but using every kind with which to embroider their poesy.<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">With this passage compare <bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1457b"

        <p>Orators, on the contrary, are not permitted the use of such devices; they must use with
          precision only words in current use and only such ideas as bear upon the actual facts.
          Besides, the poets compose all their works with meter and rhythm, while the orators do not
          share in any of these advantages; and these lend such charm that even though the poets may
          be deficient in style and thoughts, yet by the very spell of their rhythm and harmony they
          bewitch their listeners.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 601b"

        <p>The power of poetry may be understood from this consideration: if one should retain the
          words and ideas of poems which are held in high esteem, but do away with the meter, they
          will appear far inferior to the opinion we now have of them. Nevertheless, although poetry
          has advantages so great, we must not shrink from the task, but must make the effort and
          see if it will be possible in prose to eulogize good men in no worse fashion than their
          encomiasts do who employ song and verse. </p>

        <p>For it is acknowledged that the noblest of the demigods are the sons of Zeus, and there

          other families we shall find some of superior and some of inferior worth, yet all the
          Aeacidae have been most renowned of all their contemporaries. </p>

          calamity had passed all bounds, the leaders of the cities came as suppliants to him; for
          they thought that, by reason of his kinship with Zeus and his piety, they would most

        <p> So distinguished from the beginning was the heritage transmitted to Evagoras by his

        <p>on the contrary, he acted basely toward his host, and being skilled at grasping, he

          prefer to say nothing of the portents, the oracles, the visions appearing in dreams, from
          which the impression might be gained that he was of superhuman birth, not because I
          disbelieve the reports, but that I may make it clear to all that I am so far from
          resorting to invention in speaking of his deeds that even of those matters which are in

        <p> When Evagoras was a boy he possessed beauty, bodily strength, and modesty, the very
          qualities that are most becoming to that age. Witnesses could be produced for these
          assertions: for his modesty— fellow-citizens who were educated with him: for his

        <p>When he attained to manhood not only did all these qualities grow up with him, but to
          them were also added manly courage, wisdom, and justice, and that too in no ordinary
          measure, as is the case with some others, but each of these characteristics in
          extraordinary degree. So surpassing was his excellence of both body and mind, </p>

      <div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>that when the kings of that time looked upon him they were terrified and feared for their
          throne, thinking that a man of such nature could not possibly pass his life in the status
          of a private citizen, but whenever they observed his character, they felt such confidence
          in him that they believed that even if anyone else should dare to injure them, Evagoras
          would be their champion. </p>

      <div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And although opinions of him were so at variance, they were mistaken in neither respect:
          for he neither remained in private life, nor did them injury: on the contrary, the Deity
          took such thought for him that he should honorably assume the throne, that all the
          preparations which necessarily involved impiety were made by another, </p>

          and attempted to arrest Evagoras, believing that he would not be able to retain the rule
          himself unless he should get him out of the way. </p>

      <div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But Evagoras escaped this peril, and having saved himself by fleeing to <placeName

          did not show the same spirit as those who are the victims of like misfortune. For other
          exiles from royal power are humbled in spirit because of their misfortunes,whereas
          Evagoras attained to such greatness of soul that, although until that time he had lived as
          a private citizen, when he was driven into exile he determined to gain the throne. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>The wandering life of an exile, the dependence upon the help of others in seeking his
          restoration and the paying of court to his inferiors—all these he scorned: but this he
          took as his guiding principle, which those who would be god-fearing men must take—to act
          only in self-defense and never to be the aggressor: and he chose either by success to
          regain the throne or, failing in that, to die. And so, calling to his side men numbering,
          according to the highest estimates, about fifty, with these he prepared to effect his
          return from exile. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And from this venture especially the character of Evagoras and his reputation among his
          associates may be seen: for although he was on the point of sailing with so few companions
          for the accomplishment of so great a design, and although all the attendant dangers were
          near at hand, neither did he himself lose heart, nor did any of his companions see fit to
          shrink from these dangers: nay, as if a god were their leader, they one and all held fast
          to their promises, and Evagoras, just as if either he had an army superior to that of his
          adversaries or foresaw the outcome, held to his opinion. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>This is evident from his acts: for, when he had landed on the island, he did not think it
          necessary to seize a strong position, make sure of his own safety, and then to wait and
          see if some of the citizens would rally to his aid: but immediately, just as he was, on
          that very night he broke through a little gate in the wall, and leading his followers
          through this opening, attacked the palace. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>The confusion attendant upon such occasions, the fears of his followers, the exhortations

        <p> I think that even if I should mention nothing more, but should discontinue my discourse
          at this point, from what I have said the valor of Evagoras and the greatness of his deeds

          revealed from what remains to be said. </p>

        <p>For of all the many sovereigns since time began, none will be found to have won this
          honor more gloriously than Evagoras. If we were to compare the deeds of Evagoras with
          those of each one, such an account would perhaps be inappropriate to the occasion, and the
          time would not suffice for the telling. But if we select the most illustrious of these
          rulers and examine their exploits in the light of his, our investigation will lose nothing
          thereby and our discussion will be much more brief. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Who then, would not choose the perilous deeds of Evagoras before the fortunes of those
          who inherited their kingdoms from their fathers? For surely there is no one so mean of
          spirit that he would prefer to receive that power from his ancestors than first to acquire
          it, as he did, and then to bequeath it to his children. </p>

        <p>Furthermore, of the returns to their thrones by princes of ancient times the most
          renowned are those of which the poets tell us: indeed they not only chronicle for us those
          which have been most glorious, but also compose new ones of their own invention.
          Nevertheless no poet has told the story of any legendary prince who has faced hazards so
          formidable and yet regained his throne: on the contrary, most of their heroes have been
          represented as having regained their kingdoms by chance, others as having employed deceit
          and artifice to overcome their foes. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Nay, of those who lived later, perhaps indeed of all, the one hero who was most admired
          by the greatest number was Cyrus, who deprived the Medes of their kingdom and gained it
          for the Persians. But while Cyrus with a Persian army conquered the Medes, a deed which
          many a Greek or a barbarian could easily do, Evagoras manifestly accomplished the greater
          part of the deeds which have been mentioned through strength of his own mind and body.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Again, while it is not at all certain from the expedition of Cyrus that he would have
          endured the dangers of Evagoras, yet it is obvious to all from the deeds of Evagoras that
          the latter would have readily attempted the exploits of Cyrus. In addition, while piety
          and justice characterized every act of Evagoras, some of the successes of Cyrus were
          gained impiously: for the former destroyed his enemies, but Cyrus slew his mother's
            father.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Astyages, father of Mandane, who married
            Cambyses, father of Cyrus. That Cyrus slew Astyages is not stated by any other

          successes, but of the essential merit of each, they would justly award greater praise to
          Evagoras than even to Cyrus. </p>

        <p>And if there is need to speak concisely, without reservation or fear of arousing
          ill-feeling, but with the utmost frankness, I would say that no one, whether mortal,
          demigod, or immortal, will be found to have obtained his throne more nobly, more
          splendidly, or more piously. Anyone would in the highest degree be confirmed in this
          belief if, distrusting completely what I have said, he were to set about examining how
          each gained royal power. For it will be manifest that it is through no desire whatever of
          grandiloquence, but because of the truth of the matter, that I have spoken thus boldly
          about Evagoras. </p>

        <p> Nor again, though he was a man of surpassing merit in these respects, will Evagoras be
          found deficient in all others, but, in the first place, although gifted by nature with the
          highest intelligence and capable of successful action in very many fields, yet he judged
          that he should not slight any matter or act on the spur of the moment in public affairs:
          nay, he spent most of his time in inquiring, in deliberation, and in taking counsel, for
          he believed that if he should prepare his mind well, all would be well with his kingdom
            also<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 2.10">Isoc. 2.10</bibl>.</note>;

      </div>
      <div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Again, in public affairs he held to the same opinion: for, seeing that those persons who
          look best after realities are least worried, and that the true freedom from anxiety is to
          be found, not in inactivity, but in success and patient endurance, he left nothing
          unexamined: on the contrary, so thoroughly was he cognizant of public affairs and so
          thorough was his knowledge of each of the citizens, that neither those who conspired
          against him took him unawares, nor did the good citizens remain unknown to him, but all
          got their deserts: for he neither punished nor honored them on the basis of what he heard
          from others, but from his own knowledge he judged them. </p>

        <p> When he had engaged himself in the care of such matters he made not a single mistake in

          government under him: for throughout his whole life he never acted unjustly toward anyone

        <p>he was proud, not of successes that were due to Fortune, but of those that came about
          through his own efforts: his friends he made subject to himself by his benefactions the
          rest by his magnanimity he enslaved: he inspired fear, not by venting his wrath upon many,
          but because in character he far surpassed all others: of his pleasures he was the master
          and not their servant: by little labor he gained much leisure, but would not, to gain a

          general in his good counsel in the face of dangers, and princely in his superiority in all
          these qualities. That these attributes were inherent in Evagoras, and even more than

          all these defects and, besides, acquired much additional territory, surrounded it all with
          new walls and built triremes, and with other construction so increased the city that it
          was inferior to none of the cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. And

          of the war of the heroes which is celebrated in the songs of all men. For they, in company

        <p> Therefore, I believe that, if any men of the past have by their merit become immortal,

          life he lived on earth has been more blessed by fortune and more favored by the gods than
          theirs. For of the demigods the greater number and the most renowned were, we shall find,
          afflicted by the most grievous misfortunes, but Evagoras continued from the beginning to
          be not only the most admired, but also the most envied for his blessings. </p>

          most gloriously his kingdom he continued in its possession all his life: and though a
          mortal by birth, he left behind a memory of himself that is immortal, and he lived just so

          offspring he left not one who was addressed merely by a private title: on the contrary,
          one was called king,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">A reference to Nicocles.</note> others
          princes, and others princesses. In view of these facts, if any of the poets have used
          extravagant expressions in characterizing any man of the past, asserting that he was a god
