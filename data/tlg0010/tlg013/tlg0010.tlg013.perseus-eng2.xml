      <div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> When men make it a habit, Nicocles, to bring to you who are rulers of kingdoms articles
          of dress or of bronze or of wrought gold,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Echoed from <bibl
              n="Hom. Od. 16.231">Hom. Od. 16.231</bibl>.</note> or other such valuables of which
          they themselves have need and you have plenty, it seems to me all too evident that they
          are not engaged in giving but in bargaining, and that they are much more skillful in
          disposing of their wares than those who are professedly in trade. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For my part, I should think that this would be the finest and the most serviceable
          present and the most suitable for me to give and for you to receive—I could prescribe what
          pursuits you should aspire to and from what you should abstain in order to govern to the
          best advantage your state and kingdom. For when men are in private life, many things
          contribute to their education: first and foremost, the absence of luxury among them, and
          the necessity they are under to take thought each day for their livelihood; </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>next, the laws by which in each case their civic life is governed; furthermore, freedom
          of speech and the privilege which is openly granted to friends to rebuke and to enemies to
          attack each other's faults; besides, a number of the poets of earlier times<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">Especially the “gnomic” poets mentioned in 43.</note> have
          left precepts which direct them how to live; so that, from all these influences, they may
          reasonably be expected to become better men. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Kings, however, have no such help; on the contrary, they, who more than other men should
          be thoroughly trained, live all their lives, from the time when they are placed in
          authority, without admonition; for the great majority of people do not come in contact
          with them, and those who are of their society consort with them to gain their favor.
          Indeed, although they are placed in authority over vast wealth and mighty affairs, they
          have brought it about because of their misuse of these advantages that many debate whether
          it were best to choose the life of men in private station who are reasonably prosperous,
          or the life of princes. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For when men look at their honors, their wealth, and their powers, they all think that
          those who are in the position of kings are the equals of the gods; but when they reflect
          on their fears and their dangers, and when, as they review the history of monarchs, they
          see instances where they have been slain by those from whom they least deserved that fate,
          other instances where they have been constrained to sin against those nearest and dearest
          to them, and still others where they have experienced both of these calamities, then they
          reverse their judgement and conclude that it is better to live in any fashion whatsoever
          than, at the price of such misfortunes, to rule over all <placeName key="tgn,2097781"
            >Asia</placeName>. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And the cause of this inconsistency and confusion is that men believe that the office of
          king is, like that of priest,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The priestly office in
              <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> demanded care in the administration of
            ritual, but, apart from this, no special competence; it was often hereditary and
            sometimes filled by lot.</note> one which any man can fill, whereas it is the most
          important of human functions and demands the greatest wisdom. Now as to each particular
          course of action, it is the business of those who are at the time associated with a king
          to advise him how he may handle it in the best way possible, and how he may both preserve
          what is good and prevent disaster; but as regards a king's conduct in general, I shall
          attempt to set forth the objects at which he should aim and the pursuits to which he
          should devote himself. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Whether the gift when finished shall be worthy of the design, it is hard to tell at the
          beginning; for many writings both in verse and in prose, while still in the minds of their
          composers, have aroused high expectations; but when completed and shown to the world have
          won a repute far inferior to their promise. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And yet the mere attempt is well worth while—to seek a field that has been neglected by
          others and lay down principles for monarchs; for those who educate men in private stations
          benefit them alone, but if one can turn those who rule over the multitude toward a life of
          virtue, he will help both classes, both those who hold positions of authority and their
          subjects; for he will give to kings a greater security in office and to the people a
          milder government. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> First, then, we must consider what is the function of kings; for if we can properly
          encompass the essence of the whole matter in a general principle<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">For the habit of definition in Isocrates see General Introd. p. xvii.</note>
          we shall, with this before us, speak to better purpose about its parts. I think that all
          would agree that it is a king's business to relieve the state when it is in distress, to
          maintain it in prosperity, and to make it great when it is small; for it is with these
          ends in view that the other duties which present themselves day by day must be performed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And surely this much is clear, that those who are able to do all this, and who pronounce
          on matters of so great moment, must not be indolent nor careless, but must see to it that
          they are superior to all others in intelligence; for it is evident that they will reign
          well or ill according to the manner in which they equip their own minds.<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 9.41">Isoc. 9.41</bibl>.</note>

          for not all the public festivals in the world offer a prize comparable to those for which
          you who are kings strive every day of your lives. This thought you must lay to heart, and
          see to it that in proportion as you are above the others in rank so shall you surpass them
          in virtue; </p>

        <p>and do not hold the view that while diligence is of use in all other matters it is of no
          avail to make us better and wiser; and do not deem us, the human kind, so unfortunate
          that, although in dealing with wild beasts we have discovered arts by which we tame their
          spirits and increase their worth, yet in our own case we are powerless to help ourselves
          in the pursuit of virtue.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">This thought and comparison is

          contrary, be convinced that education and diligence are in the highest degree potent to

          men from abroad whenever this is possible. And do not imagine that you can afford to be
          ignorant of anyone either of the famous poets or of the sages; rather you should listen to
          the poets and learn from the sages and so equip your mind to judge those who are inferior
          and to emulate those who are superior to yourself; for it is through this training that
          you can soonest become such a man as we have assumed that one must be who is to perform
          properly the duties of a king, and to govern the state as he should. </p>
