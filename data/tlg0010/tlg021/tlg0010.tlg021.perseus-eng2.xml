          them but with a statement of my personal experience, since it is more urgent, I think, to
          begin with this. For notwithstanding that I strive to live in a manner above reproach and
          without offence to others, I am continually being misrepresented by obscure and worthless
          sophists and being judged by the general public, not by what I really am, but by what they
          hear from others.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 15.4">Isoc.

        <p>I wish, therefore, to preface my discussion with a word about myself and about those who
          have this attitude towards me, in order that, if only it lies within my power to do so, I
          may put an end to the abuse of my calumniators and give to the public a clear
          understanding of the work to which I am devoted. For if I succeed in setting forth a true
          picture of this in my discourse, I hope not only that I myself may pass the rest of my
          days free from annoyance but that my present audience will give better attention to the
          discourse which is about to be delivered. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> I am not going to hesitate to tell you frankly of the confusion which now comes into my
          thoughts, of the strangeness of my feelings on the present occasion, and of my perplexity
          as to whether I am doing anything to the purpose. For I have had my share of the greatest
          goods of life—the things which all men would pray the gods to have as their portion:<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">For the “greatest goods” cf. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 631c">Plat.

            disposition then;/Next, to be rich by no by-wayes;/Lastly, with friends t'enjoy our
            dayes.”</note> first of all, I have enjoyed health both of body and of soul, not in
          common degree, but in equal measure with those who have been most blessed in these
            respects;<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Bacchyl. Ep. 1.27">Bacchyl. 1.27

          comfortable circumstances, so that I have not lacked for any of the moderate satisfactions

      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>and, lastly, I have been ranked, not among those who are despised or ignored, but among
          those whom the most cultivated of the Hellenes will recall and talk about as men of
          consequence and worth. And yet, although I have been blessed with all these gifts, some in
          surpassing, others in sufficient measure, I am not content to live on these terms; on the
          contrary, my old age is so morose and captious and discontented that I have oftentimes
          before this found fault with my nature, </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>which no other man has contemned, and have deplored my fortune, although I have had no
          complaint against it other than that the philosophy which I have chosen to pursue has been
          the object of unfortunate and unscrupulous attacks.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Such as
            are described at the beginning of the <bibl n="Isoc. 15.">Isoc. 15.</bibl>.</note> As to
          my nature, however, I realized that it was not robust and vigorous enough for public
          affairs and that it was not adequate nor altogether suited to public discourse, and that,
          furthermore, although it was better able to form a correct judgement of the truth of any
          matter than are those who claim to have exact knowledge,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"

          expounding the truth before an assemblage of many people it was, if I may say so, the

      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For I was born more lacking in the two things which have the greatest power in Athens—a

        <p>And yet I did not permit these disabilities to dishearten me nor did I allow myself to

          refuge in study and work and writing down my thoughts, choosing as my field, not petty
          matters nor private contracts, nor the things about which the other orators prate, but the

          my enemies and denounce those who are accustomed always to speak falsely of me and do not
          scruple to say things which are repugnant to my nature? But if I showed that I took them

          me, if, in dealing with men who are hostile to me for no other reason than that I appear
          to have discoursed cleverly on certain subjects, I thought that by speaking just as I have

          know by what terms of praise I can adequately extol the genius of those men who, having no

        <p>But I, for my part, hold that there are three types of polity and three only: oligarchy,

              Pol. 3.6 ff.</bibl>, recognizes three types: monarchy, aristocracy, and a republic,
            and, corresponding to them (aberrations from them), three debased forms, tyranny,
            oligarchy, and democracy. Isocrates' point is that any one of these forms may be an
            aristocracy; it is the spirit of the constitution which matters (<bibl n="Isoc. 12.138"
              >Isoc. 12.138</bibl>); that government is best (i.e. an aristocracy) where the best

          in charge of their offices and of their affairs in general those of their fellow-citizens
          who are most competent and who will most ably and justly direct the affairs of state—all
          these, I hold, will govern well, under any type of polity, both in their domestic

        <p>On the other hand, when men employ in these positions of leadership those of their

          things which are advantageous to the commonwealth but are ready to go to any extreme to
          further their personal advantage, the character of their government will correspond to the
          depravity of the men at the head of their affairs. Again, all who are not of the latter
          class nor of that which I mentioned previously, but who, when they feel secure, honor
          before others those who speak for the gratification of the public and, when they are

          polity of our ancestors. For I undertook to prove that this has been of greater worth and

          used in the arts or in many other activities, but of the excellence which in the hearts of

          For when, after three or four days had elapsed, I was reading and going over it, I found
          that, while I was not troubled about the things which I had said about Athens (for in

          altogether without understanding. The result was that I was often on the point of blotting
          out or burning what I had written and as often changed my mind when I thought with pity of

          to be entirely destroyed or to be distributed among those who desired to have it, and to
          follow their judgement whatever it might be. Having so resolved, I lost no time; they whom
          I have mentioned were summoned at once; I announced to them beforehand the object of their
          coming together the speech was read aloud, was praised and applauded and accorded even

          among themselves, presumably about the discourse which had been read. But the man whom I
          had sent for at first to obtain his advice (the panegyrist of the Lacedaemonians, to whom
          I had spoken at greater length than I should), having remained silent in the meantime,
          turned to me and said that he was in doubt what to do in the present situation, for he
          desired neither to discredit the words which I had spoken nor was he able to credit them

          together because you desired to get our advice about your discourse, since you knew well
          enough that we always commend whatever you say or do. Men of intelligence are accustomed
          to take common counsel with others regarding matters about which they are concerned,
          preferably with those who are wiser than themselves, but, at any rate, with those who will
          express their own judgement. But you have done the very opposite. </p>

          summoned us here and pronounced your encomium on Athens, not ingenuously nor for the

          cultivated life, if we remembered what had been said to us under your tutelage, and if we

          confined your discourse to Athens alone and repeated the fables about her which fall
          easily from the lips of everyone, your speech would appear no different from those which
          had been composed by the other orators (which would cause you extreme humiliation and

          have been done by the Lacedaemonians, not only would your discourse make a more striking
          impression upon your hearers but you yourself would lose no ground, and many would admire

          this difficulty, you proceeded to study in what light you could represent each of these
          two cities in order that you might seem to speak the truth about them both and that you
          might be able to praise your ancestors, just as you purposed to do, and at the same time

          self-seeking, as indeed they have been conceived by all men to be. “Such being the nature

          high-minded than those who champion equality, just as those who are warlike are regarded
          as superior to those who are peaceable. For the latter are neither seekers after what they

          bad repute with all men they come off worse in all circumstances, whereas the self-seeking

          these, in the first place, not to trust in their own opinions nor to regard as true the
          judgements which are pronounced by the lazy-minded and, in the second place, not to
          publish hastily their views on things which they do not understand, but to wait until they
          can find themselves in accord with men who have much experience of matters submitted to
          them for judgement;<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Literally, “experience of things
            shown.” Others render “experience in epideictic oratory.”</note> for if they will so
          govern their thoughts, no one can fail to approve their discretion.</p>
