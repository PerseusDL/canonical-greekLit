        <p> In many respects, Demonicus, we shall find that much disparity exists between the
          principles of good men and the notions of the base; but most of all by far have they
          parted company in the quality of their friendships.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">For the
            sentiment that bad men make poor friends cf. <bibl n="Thgn. 101">Theog. 101 ff.</bibl>,

          the good cherish theirs even when they are far away; and while it takes only a short time
          to break up the intimacies of the base, not all eternity can blot out the friendships of
          good men. </p>

        <p>So then, since I deem it fitting that those who strive for distinction and are ambitious
          for education should emulate the good and not the bad, I have dispatched to you this
          discourse as a gift, in proof of my good will toward you and in token of my friendship for
          Hipponicus; for it is fitting that a son should inherit his father's friendships even as
          he inherits his estate. </p>

        <p>I see, moreover, that fortune is on our side and that the present circumstances are in

            see Introduction, pp. xxv. ff.</note> and I direct students of philosophy. Now those who

            service<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Hermogenes, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*peri\

        <p> Therefore, I have not invented a hortatory<note anchored="true" resp="ed">This discourse
            is really hortatory in the general sense of that word, but Isocrates distinguishes it
            from hortatory (“protreptic”) discourses of the sophists, which were lectures to
            stimulate interest in whatever kind of learning they professed to teach, commonly
            oratory.</note> exercise, but have written a moral treatise; and I am going to counsel
          you on the objects to which young men should aspire and from what actions they should
          abstain, and with what sort of men they should associate and how they should regulate
          their own lives. For only those who have travelled this road in life have been able in the
          true sense to attain to virtue—that possession which is the grandest and the most enduring
          in the world. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For beauty is spent by time or withered by disease; wealth ministers to vice rather than
          to nobility of soul, affording means for indolent living and luring the young to pleasure;
          strength, in company with wisdom, is, indeed, an advantage, but without wisdom it harms
          more than it helps its possessors, and while it sets off the bodies of those who cultivate
          it, yet it obscures the care of the soul<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl
              n="Isoc. 4.1">Isoc. 4.1</bibl>.</note>. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But virtue, when it grows up with us in our hearts without alloy, is the one possession
          which abides with us in old age; it is better than riches and more serviceable than high
          birth; it makes possible what is for others impossible; it supports with fortitude that
          which is fearful to the multitude; and it considers sloth a disgrace and toil an honor.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>This it is easy to learn from the labors of Heracles and the exploits of Theseus, whose
          excellence of character has impressed upon their exploits so clear a stamp of glory that
          not even endless time can cast oblivion upon their achievements. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Nay, if you will but recall also your father's principles, you will have from your own
          house a noble illustration of what I am telling you. For he did not belittle virtue nor
          pass his life in indolence; on the contrary, he trained his body by toil, and by his
          spirit he withstood dangers. Nor did he love wealth inordinately; but, although he enjoyed
          the good things at his hand as became a mortal, yet he cared for his possessions as if he
          had been immortal<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Bacchyl. Ep. 3.78">Bacchyl.

            wilt live out thy life in ample wealth;” and <placeName key="tgn,2007838"

        <p>Neither did he order his existence sordidly, but was a lover of beauty, munificent in his
          manner of life, and generous to his friends; and he prized more those who were devoted to
          him than those who were his kin by blood; for he considered that in the matter of
          companionship nature is a much better guide than convention, character than kinship, and
          freedom of choice than compulsion. </p>

        <p> But all time would fail us if we should try to recount all his activities. On another
          occasion I shall set them forth in detail;<note anchored="true" resp="ed">This intention
            was not, so far as we know, carried out.</note> for the present however, I have produced
          a sample of the nature of Hipponicus, after whom you should pattern your life as after an
          example, regarding his conduct as your law, and striving to imitate and emulate your
          father's virtue; for it were a shame, when painters represent the beautiful among animals,
          for children not to imitate the noble among their ancestors. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Nay, you must consider that no athlete is so in duty bound to train against his
          competitors as are you to take thought how you may vie with your father in his ways of
          life. But it is not possible for the mind to be so disposed unless one is fraught with
          many noble maxims; for, as it is the nature of the body to be developed by appropriate
          exercises, it is the nature of the soul to be developed by moral precepts. Wherefore I
          shall endeavor to set before you concisely by what practices I think you can make the most
          progress toward virtue and win the highest repute in the eyes of all other men. </p>

          not merely by doing sacrifice, but also by keeping your vows; for the former is but
          evidence of a material prosperity, whereas the latter is proof of a noble character. Do
          honor to the divine power at all times, but especially on occasions of public worship; for
          thus you will have the reputation both of sacrificing to the gods and of abiding by the

          even to mention. Accustom yourself to be, not of a stern, but of a thoughtful, mien; for
          through the former you will be thought self-willed, through the latter, intelligent.
          Consider that no adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice, and self-control; for these
          are the virtues by which, as all men are agreed, the character of the young is held in

        <p> Do not be surprised that many things which I have said do not apply to you at your
          present age. For I also have not overlooked this fact, but I have deliberately chosen to
          employ this one treatise, not only to convey to you advice for your life now, but also to
          leave with you precepts for the years to come; for you will then readily perceive the
          application of my precepts, but you will not easily find a man who will give you friendly
          counsel. In order, therefore, that you may not seek the rest from another source, but that
          you may draw from this as from a treasure-house, I thought that I ought not to omit any of
          the counsels which I have to give you. </p>

        <p> And I shall be most grateful to the gods if I am not disappointed in the opinion which I
          have of you. For, while we find that the great majority of other men seek the society of
          those friends who join them in their follies and not of those who admonish them, just as
          they prefer the most pleasant to the most wholesome food,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"

          otherwise, as I judge from the industry you display in your general education. For when
          one sets for himself the highest standard of conduct, it is probable that in his relation
          to others he will approve only of those who exhort him to virtue. </p>

          that it is from them most of all that we also derive pleasure in the true sense. For while
          the result of indolence and love of surfeit is that pain follows on the heels of
            pleasure,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl n="Isoc. 1.16">Isoc. 1.16</bibl>;

          toil in the pursuit of virtue, and self-control in the ordering of one's life always yield
          delights that are pure and more abiding. In the former case we experience pain following
          upon pleasure, in the latter we enjoy pleasure after pain. </p>

        <p>In all our tasks we are not so much mindful of the beginning as we are sensible of the

        <p> Bear in mind that while the base may be pardoned for acting without principle, since it
          is on such a foundation that from the first their lives have been built, yet the good may
          not neglect virtue without subjecting themselves to rebukes from many quarters; for all
          men despise less those who do wrong than those who have claimed to be respect able and yet

          have revealed very clearly in their treatment of their nearest kin how they are disposed
          to the good and base among men. For Zeus, who, as the myths relate and all men believe,
          was the father of Heracles and Tantalus, made the one immortal because of his virtue, and
          inflicted on the other the severest punishments because of his evil character. </p>
