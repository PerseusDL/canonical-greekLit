          prowess of men's bodies to be deserving of so great bounties, while to those who had
          toiled in private for the public good and trained their own minds so as to be able to help
          also their fellow-men they apportioned no reward whatsoever,<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">This is not quite exact (see <bibl n="Lys. 33.2">Lys. 33.2</bibl>), nor
            consistent with § 45 where he mentions contests of intellect and prizes for them. But
            the mild interest which these evoked served but to emphasize the excess of enthusiasm
            for athletics against which Isocrates here and elsewhere protests. Cf. <bibl
              n="Isoc. 15.250">Isoc. 15.250</bibl> and <bibl n="Isoc. L. 8.5">Isoc. Letter
              8.5</bibl>. The complaint is older than Isocrates. See Xenophanes, Fr. 19.</note>

      </div>
      <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>when, in all reason, they ought rather to have made provision for the latter; for if all
          the athletes should acquire twice the strength which they now possess, the rest of the
          world would be no better off; but let a single man attain to wisdom, and all men will reap
          the benefit who are willing to share his insight. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Yet I have not on this account lost heart nor chosen to abate my labors; on the
          contrary, believing that I shall have a sufficient reward in the approbation which my
          discourse will itself command, I have come before you to give my counsels on the war
          against the barbarians and on concord among ourselves. I am, in truth, not unaware that
          many of those who have claimed to be sophists<note anchored="true" resp="ed">For the
            meaning of the word “sophist” see General Introd. p. xii. The word is commonly
            translated “orator,” since the sophists concerned themselves mainly with exemplifying
            and teaching oratory; but the sophist speaks only on the lecture platform; the political
            orator is called a “rhetor” in Isocrates. Gorgias and Lysias in their Olympic orations
            had spoken on this theme, but it is hardly probable that Isocrates had them particularly
            in mind in this patronizing remark.</note>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>have rushed upon this theme, but I hope to rise so far superior to them that it will seem
          as if no word had ever been spoken by my rivals upon this subject; and, at the same time,
          I have singled out as the highest kind of oratory<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. <bibl
              n="Lys. 33.3">Lys. 33.3</bibl>. For Isocrates, idea of the highest oratory see General
            Introd. p. xxiv.</note> that which deals with the greatest affairs and, while best
          displaying the ability of those who speak, brings most profit to those who hear; and this
          oration is of that character. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>In the next place, the moment for action has not yet gone by, and so made it now futile
          to bring up this question; for then, and only then, should we cease to speak, when the
          conditions have come to an end and there is no longer any need to deliberate about them,
          or when we see that the discussion of them is so complete that there is left to others no
          room to improve upon what has been said. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But so long as conditions go on as before, and what has been said about them is
          inadequate, is it not our duty to scan and study this question, the right decision of
          which will deliver us from our mutual warfare, our present confusion, and our greatest
          ills? </p>
      </div>
      <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Furthermore, if it were possible to present the same subject matter in one form and in
          no other, one might have reason to think it gratuitous to weary one's hearers by speaking
          again in the same manner as his predecessors; but since oratory is of such a nature </p>
      </div>
      <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>that it is possible to discourse on the same subject matter in many different ways—to
          represent the great as lowly or invest the little with grandeur, to recount the things of
          old in a new manner or set forth events of recent date in an old fashion<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">The author of the treatise <title>On the Sublime</title>, 38,
            quotes this passage and condemns Isocrates' “puerility” in thus dwelling on the power of
            rhetoric when leading up to his praise of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
              >Athens</placeName>, and so arousing distrust of his sincerity. But the objection
            loses its force if Isocrates is here using what had become a conventionalized statement
            of the power of oratory. This it probably was. <bibl>Plut. Orat. 838f</bibl>, attributes
            to Isocrates the definition of rhetoric as the means of making “small things great and
            great things small.” A similar view is attributed to the rhetoricians Tisias and Gorgias
            in <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 267a">Plat. Phaedrus 267a</bibl>, who are credited with
            “making small things appear great and great things small, and with presenting new things
            in an old way and old themes in a modern fashion through the power of speech.” Cf. <bibl
              n="Isoc. 11.4">Isoc.11.4</bibl> and <bibl n="Isoc. 12.36">Isoc. 12.36</bibl>; also
            Julian, Oration, i. 2 C.</note>—it follows that one must not shun the subjects upon
          which others have spoken before, but must try to speak better than they. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For the deeds of the past are, indeed, an inheritance common to us all; but the ability
          to make proper use of them at the appropriate time, to conceive the right sentiments about
          them in each instance, and to set them forth in finished phrase, is the peculiar gift of
          the wise. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>And it is my opinion that the study<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Literally the
            “philosophy which has to do with oratory”—culture expressed in speech. For “philosophy”
            as used by Isocrates see General Introd. p. xxvi.</note> of oratory as well as the other
          arts would make the greatest advance if we should admire and honor, not those who make the
          first beginnings in their crafts, but those who are the most finished craftsmen in each,
          and not those who seek to speak on subjects on which no one has spoken before, but those
          who know how to speak as no one else could. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p> Yet there are some who carp at discourses which are beyond the powers of ordinary men
          and have been elaborated with extreme care, and who have gone so far astray that they
          judge the most ambitious oratory by the standard of the pleas made in the petty actions of
          the courts;<note anchored="true" resp="ed">For Isocrates' opinion of court oratory see
            General Introd. p. xxii.</note> as if both kinds should be alike and should not be
          distinguished, the one by plainness of style, the other by display; or as if they
          themselves saw clearly the happy mean, while the man who knows how to speak elegantly
          could not speak simply and plainly if he chose. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>Now these people deceive no one; clearly they praise those who are near their own level.
          I, for my part, am not concerned with such men, but rather with those who will not
          tolerate, but will resent, any carelessness of phrase, and will seek to find in my
          speeches a quality which they will not discover in others. Addressing myself to these, I
          shall proceed with my theme, after first vaunting a little further my own powers. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>For I observe that the other orators in their introductions seek to conciliate their
          hearers and make excuses for the speeches which they are about to deliver,<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed">This is done by <bibl n="Lys. 2.1">Lys. 2.1</bibl>, by <bibl

              12.36-38</bibl>.</note> sometimes alleging that their preparation has been on the spur
          of the moment, sometimes urging that it is difficult to find words to match the greatness
          of their theme. </p>
      </div>
      <div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But as for myself, if I do not speak in a manner worthy of my subject and of my
          reputation and of the time which I have spent<note anchored="true" resp="ed">See General
            Introd. p. 30.</note>—not merely the hours which have been devoted to my speech but also
          all the years which I have lived—I bid you show me no indulgence but hold me up to
          ridicule and scorn; for there is nothing of the sort which I do not deserve to suffer, if
          indeed, being no better than the others, I make promises so great.<note anchored="true"
            resp="ed">This self-confidence is something more than Isocratean vanity. It is a
            conscious device to enhance the greatness of this theme. At the beginning he is exalted
            by its magnitude; at the end, 187, he is cast down by his failure to measure up to it.

          So much, by way of introduction, as to my personal claims. </p>

      <div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
        <p>But as to our public interests, the speakers who no sooner come before us than they

          mutual warfare and the advantages which will result from a campaign against our natural
          enemy—these men do speak the truth, but they do not start at the point from which they
          could best bring these things to pass. </p>

        <p>For the Hellenes are subject, some to us, others to the Lacedaemonians, the polities<note

          before he brings the leading states into friendly relations, the rest will unite in doing
          any good thing, he is all too simple and out of touch with the actual conditions. </p>

        <p>No, the man who does not aim merely to make an oratorical display, but desires to
          accomplish something as well, must seek out such arguments as will persuade these two
          states to share and share alike with each other, to divide the supremacy between them, and
          to wrest from the barbarians the advantages which at the present time they desire to seize
          for themselves at the expense of the Hellenes.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Almost the

        <p> Now our own city could easily be induced to adopt this policy, but at present the
          Lacedaemonians are still hard to persuade; for they have inherited the false doctrine that
          leadership is theirs by ancestral right. If, however, one should prove to them that this
          honor belongs to us rather than to them, perhaps they might give up splitting hairs about
          this question and pursue their true interests. </p>

        <p> So, then, the other speakers also should have made this their starting-point and should

          we do not settle our wars, but only postpone them and wait for the opportune moment when

          greater confidence in each other. What I have to say on these points is simple and easy:
          It is not possible for us to cement an enduring peace unless we join together in a war
          against the barbarians, nor for the Hellenes to attain to concord until we wrest our
          material advantages from one and the same source and wage our wars against one and the
          same enemy.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">That is, instead of warring among themselves
            and plundering each other, the Greeks must wage their wars against, and seek their
            plunder from, the barbarians. Cf. 15 and 187; <bibl n="Isoc. 5.9">Isoc.

            resp="ed">Cf. Theognis, 386 ff.</note>—then surely we shall enjoy a spirit of concord,
          and the good will which we shall feel towards each other will be genuine. For all these
          reasons, we must make it our paramount duty to transfer the war with all speed from our
          boundaries to the continent, since the only benefit which we can reap from the wars which
          we have waged against each other is by resolving that the experience which we have gained

          not be over-hasty or make the expedition too soon, seeing that the states which have
          gained their freedom through the Treaty feel grateful toward the King, because they
          believe that it was through him that they gained their independence, while those states
          which have been delivered over to the barbarians complain very bitterly of the
          Lacedaemonians and only less bitterly of the other Hellenes who entered into the peace,
          because, in their view, they were forced by them into slavery? But, I reply, is it not our
          duty to annul this agreement, which has given birth to such a sentiment—the sentiment that
          the barbarian cares tenderly for <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, and

        <p>The crowning absurdity of all, however, is the fact that among the articles which are

          enemy—these remain intact, and we all regard them as binding upon us, though we ought to
          have expunged them and not allowed them to stand a single day, looking upon them as
          commands, and not as compacts; for who does not know that a compact is something which is
          fair and impartial to both parties, while a command is something which puts one side at a

          because, although dispatched by the Hellenes, they made the Treaty in the interest of the

          over all that it had acquired by conquest, or that we should each retain control over what
          we held when peace was declared—they ought, I say, to have adopted definitely some one of
          these views, applying the principle impartially to all, and on this basis to have drafted

          slaves, to permit by our public policy so many of our allies to be enslaved by them; and
          it is disgraceful for us, when our fathers who engaged in the Trojan expedition because of
          the rape of one woman, all shared so deeply in the indignation of the wronged that they

          common vengeance, although we have it in our power to accomplish deeds as lofty as our
          dreams. For this war is the only war which is better than peace; it will be more like a
          sacred mission than a military expedition; and it will profit equally both those who crave
          the quiet life and those who are eager for war; for it will enable the former to reap the

          unfortunate among us? And against whom should those take the field who both desire to
          serve their gods and are at the same time intent on their own advantage? Is it not against
          those who are both their natural enemies and their hereditary foes, who have acquired the

          it is my belief that those who will be inclined to remain at home will be far fewer than
          those who will be eager to join this army. For who, be he young or old, is so indolent
          that he will not desire to have a part in this expedition—an expedition led by the
          Athenians and the Lacedaemonians, gathered together in the cause of the liberty of our
          allies, dispatched by all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and faring

          Asia? For who that is skilled to sing or trained to speak will not labor and study in his
