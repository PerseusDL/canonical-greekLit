<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Since I perceive, most excellent Diognetus, that<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Introduction</note> you are exceedingly zealous to learn the religion of the Christians and are asking very clear and careful questions concerning them, both who is the God in whom they believe, and how they worship him, so that all disregard the world and despise death, and do not reckon as Gods those who are considered to be so by the Greeks, nor keep the superstition of the Jews, and what is the love which they have for one another, and why this new race or practice has come to life at this time, and not formerly; I indeed welcome this zeal in you, and I ask from God who bestows on us the power both of speaking and of hearing, that it may be granted to me so to speak that you may benefit so much as possible by your hearing, and to you so to hear that I may not be made sorry for my speech.</p> </div> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Come then, clear yourself of all the prejudice<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Discussion of the Gods of the heathen</note> which occupies your mind, and throw aside the custom which deceives you, and become as it were <pb xml:id="p.353"/> a new man from the beginning, as one, as you yourself also admitted, who is about to listen to a new story. Look, not only with your eyes, but also with your intelligence, what substance or form they chance to have whom you call gods and regard as such. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Is not one a stone, like that on which we walk, another bronze, no better than the vessels which have been forged for our use, another wood already rotten, another silver, needing a man to guard it against theft, another iron, eaten by rust, another earthenware, not a whit more comely than that which is supplied for the most ordinary service?</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Are not all these of perishable material? Were they not forged by iron and fire? Did not the wood-carver make one, the brass-founder another, the silversmith another, the potter another. Before they were moulded by their arts, into the shapes which they have, was it not possible and does it not still remain possible, for each of them to have been given a different shape? Might not vessels made out of the same material, if they met with the same artificers, be still made similar to such as they?<note resp="editor" type="footnote">The meaning is that, given the requisite workers, the material used for ordinary vessels of wood or brass or silver might at any moment be turned into a <q>god.</q></note></p> </div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Again, would it not be possible, for these, which are now worshipped by you, to be made by men into vessels like any others? Are they not all dumb? Are they not blind? Are they not without souls? Are they not without feeling? Are they not without movement? Are not they all rotting? Are they not all decaying?</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Do you call these things gods? Are these what you serve? Are these what you worship and in the end become like them?</p> </div> 
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Is this the reason <pb xml:id="p.355"/> why you hate the Christiansâ€”that they do not think that these are gods?</p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>For is it not you, who, though you think and believe that you are praising the gods, are much more despising them? Are you not much rather mocking and insulting them, when you worship those of stone and earthenware without guarding them; but lock up at night and in the day-time place guards over those of silver and gold, that they be not stolen away. </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And, if they have powers of perception, by the honours which you think to pay them you are rather punishing them, and, if they are without perception, you are refuting them by worshipping them with blood and burnt fat. </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Let one of you suffer these things, let him endure that it should be done to him. Why, there is not a single man who would willingly endure this punishment, for he has perception and reason. But the stone endures, for it has no perception. Do you not then refute its perception?</p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>I could say much more as to the refusal of Christians to serve such gods, but if any one find these arguments insufficient, I think it useless to say more.</p> </div> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>In the next place I think that you are especially anxious to hear why the Christians do not<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The difference between Jews and Christians</note> worship in the same way as the Jews.</p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>The Jews indeed, by abstaining from the religion already discussed, may rightly claim that they worship the one God of the Universe, and regard him as master, but in offering service to him in like manner to those already dealt with they are quite wrong.</p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For just as the Greeks give a proof of foolishness <pb xml:id="p.357"/> by making offerings to senseless and deaf images, so the Jews ought rather to consider that they are showing foolishness, not reverence, by regarding God as in need of these things. </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For <q>He who made heaven and earth and all that is in them,</q> and bestows on all of us that which we need, would not himself have need of any of these things which he himself supplies to those who think that they are giving them. </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For after all, those who think that they are consecrating sacrifices to him by blood and burnt fat, and whole burnt offerings, and that they are reverencing him by these honours, seem to me to be in no way better than those who show the same respect to deaf images. For it seems that the one offer to those who cannot partake of the honour, the others to him who is in need of nothing.</p> </div> </div> 
            
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Moreover I do not suppose that youmeed to learn from me that, after all, their scruples about food and superstition about the Sabbath, and their pride in circumcision and the sham of their fasting and feast of the new moon, are ridiculous and unworthy of any argument. </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For how can it be anything but unlawful to receive some of the things created by God for the use of man as if well created, and to reject others as if useless and superfluous?</p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And what can it be but impious falsely to accuse God of forbidding that a good deed should be done on the Sabbath day?</p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And what does it deserve but ridicule to be proud of the mutilation of the flesh as a proof of election, as if <pb xml:id="p.359"/> they were, for this reason, especially beloved by God? </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And their attention to the stars and moon, for the observance of months and days, and for their arbitrary distinctions between the changing seasons ordained by God, making some into feasts, and others into occasions of mourning;â€”who would regard this as a proof of piety, and not much more of foolishness? </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>So then I think that you have learnt sufficiently that the Christians do rightly in abstaining from the general silliness and deceit and fussiness and pride of the Jews. But do not suppose that you can learn from man the mystery of the Christiansâ€™ own religion.</p> </div> </div> 
            
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5"> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <p>For the distinction between Christians and<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The true distinction of Christians</note> other men, is neither in country nor language nor customs.</p> </div>

   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Yet while living in Greek and barbarian cities, according as each obtained his lot, and following the local customs, both in clothing and food and in the rest of life, they show forth the wonderful and confessedly strange character of the constitution of their own citizenship. </p> </div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>They dwell in their own fatherlands, but as if sojourners in them; they share all things as citizens, and suffer  <pb xml:id="p.361"/>  all things as strangers.

     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But in truth the Almighty and all-creating and invisible God himself founded among <pb xml:id="p.365"/> men the truth from heaven, and the holy and incomprehensible word, and established it in their hearts, not, as one might suppose, by sending some minister to men, or an angel, or ruler, or one of those who direct earthly things, or one of those who are entrusted with the dispensations in heaven, but the very artificer and Creator of the universe himself, by whom he made the heavens, by whom he enclosed the sea in its own bounds, whose mysteries all the elements guard faithfully; from whom the sun received the measure of the courses of the day, to whose command the moon is obedient to give light by night, whom the stars obey, following the course of the moon, by whom all things were ordered, and ordained, and placed in subjection, the heavens and the things in the heavens, the earth and the things in the earth, the sea and the things in the sea, fire, air, abyss, the things in the heights, the things in the depths, the things between themâ€”him he sent to them. </p> </div>
