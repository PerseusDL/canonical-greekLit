<head>Fragments of Epictetus</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="A"> 
  <div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="preface">
  <p>THESE Fragments are entitled <title xml:lang="lat">Epicteti Fragmenta maxime ex Ioanne Stobaeo, Antonio, et Maximo collecta</title> (ed. Schweig.). There are some notes and emendations on the Fragments; and a short dissertation on them by Schweighaeuser.</p> 
  <p>Nothing is known of Stobaeus nor of his time, except the fact that he has preserved some extracts of an ethical kind from the New Platonist Hierocles, who lived about the middle of the fifth century A. D.; and it is therefore concluded that Stobaeus lived after Hierocles. The fragments attributed to Epictetus are preserved by Stobaeus in his work entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀνφολόγιον</foreign>, or Florilegium or Sermones.</p> 
  <p>Antonius Monachus, a Greek monk, also made a Florilegium, entitled Melissa (the bee). His date is uncertain, but it was certainly much later than the time of Stobaeus.</p> 
  <p>Maximus, also named the monk, and reverenced as a saint, is said to have been a native of Constantinople, and born about A. D. <date when="0580">580</date>.</p> 
  <p>Some of the Fragments contained in the edition of Schweighaeuser are certainly not from Epictetus. Many of the fragments are obscure; but they are translated as accurately as I can translate them, and the reader must give to them such meaning as he can. <pb n="406" /></p>  </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="1"> 
<p>THE life which is implicated with fortune (depends on fortune) is like a winter torrent: for it is turbulent, and full of mud, and difficult to cross, and tyrannical, and noisy, and of short duration.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="2"> 
  <p>A soul which is conversant with virtue is like an ever flowing source, for it is pure and tranquil and potable and sweet<note anchored="true">Consult the Lexicons for this sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόστιμος</foreign>.</note> and communicative (social), and rich and harmless and free from mischief.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="3"> 
<p>If you wish to be good, first believe that you are bad.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="4"> 
<p>It is better to do wrong seldom and to own it, and to act right for the most part, than seldom to admit that you have done wrong and to do wrong often.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="5"> 
  <p>Check (punish) your passions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάφη</foreign>), that you may not be punished by them.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="6"> 
<p>Do not so much be ashamed of that (disgrace) which proceeds from men’s opinion as fly from that which comes from the truth.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="7"> 
<p>If you wish to be well spoken of, learn to speak well (of others): and when you have learned to speak well of them, try to act well, and so you will reap the fruit of being well spoken of.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="8"> 
<p>Freedom and slavery, the one is the name of virtue, and the other of vice: and both are acts of the will. But where there is no will, neither of them touches (affects) <pb n="407"/> these things. But the soul is accustomed to be master of the body, and the things which belong to the body have no share in the will. For no man is a slave who is free in his will.<note anchored="true">See Schweig.’s note.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="9"> 
<p>It is an evil chain, fortune (a chain) of the body, and vice of the soul. For he who is loose (free) in the body, but bound in the soul is a slave: but on the contrary he who is bound in the body, but free (unbound) in the soul, is free.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="10"> 
<p>The bond of the body is loosened by nature through death, and by vice through money:<note anchored="true"><quote>He does not say this <q rend="single">that it is bad if a man by money should redeem himself from bonds,</q> but he means that <q rend="single">even a bad man, if he has money, can redeem himself from the bonds of the body and so secure his liberty.</q></quote> Schweig.</note> but the bond of the soul is loosened by learning, and by experience and by discipline.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="11"> 
<p>If you wish to live without perturbation and with pleasure, try to have all who dwell with you good. And you will have them good, if you instruct the willing, and dismiss those who are unwilling (to be taught): for there will fly away together with those who have fled away both wickedness and slavery; and there will be left with those who remain with you goodness and liberty.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="12"> 
<p>It is a shame for those who sweeten drink with the gifts of the bees, by badness to embitter reason which is the gift of the gods.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="13"> 
<p>No man who loves money, and loves pleasure, and loves fame, also loves mankind, but only he who loves virtue. <pb n="408"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="14"> 
<p>As you would not choose to sail in a large and decorated and gold-laden ship (or ship ornamented with gold), and to be drowned; so do not choose to dwell in a large and costly house and to be disturbed (by cares).</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="15"> 
<p>When we have been invited to a banquet, we take what is set before us: but if a guest should ask the host to set before him fish or sweet cakes, he would be considered to be an unreasonable fellow. But in the world we ask the Gods for what they do not give; and we do this though the things are many which they have given.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="16"> 
  <p>They are amusing fellows, said he (Epictetus), who are proud of the things which are not in our power. A man says, I am better than you, for I possess much land, and you are wasting with hunger. Another says, I am of consular rank. Another says, I am a Procurator (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτροπος</foreign>). Another, I have curly hair. But a horse does not say to a horse, I am superior to you, for I possess much fodder, and much barley, and my bits are of gold and my harness is embroidered: but he says, I am swifter than you. And every animal is better or worse from his own merit (virtue) or his own badness. Is there then no virtue in man only? and must we look to the hair, and our clothes and to our ancestors?</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="17"> 
<p>The sick are vexed with the physician who gives them no advice, and think that he has despaired of them. But why should they not have the same feeling towards the philosopher, and think that he has despaired of their coming to a sound state of mind, if he says nothing at all that is useful to a man? <pb n="409"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="18"> 
<p>Those who are well constituted in the body endure both heat and cold: and so those who are well constituted in the soul endure both anger and grief and excessive joy and the other affects.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="19"> 
<p>Examine yourself whether you wish to be rich or to be happy. If you wish to be rich, you should know that it is neither a good thing nor at all in your power: but if you wish to be happy, you should know that it is both a good thing and in your power, for the one is a temporary loan of fortune, and happiness comes from the will.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="20"> 
<p>As when you see a viper or an asp or a scorpion in an ivory or golden box, you do not on account of the costliness of the material love it or think it happy, but because the nature of it is pernicious, you turn away from it and loathe it; so when you shall see vice dwelling in wealth and in the swollen fulness of fortune, be not struck by the splendour of the material, but despise the false character of the morals.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="21"> 
  <p>Wealth is not one of the good things; great expenditure is one of the bad; moderation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>)is one of the good things. And moderation invites to frugality and the acquisition of good things: but wealth invites to great expenditure and draws us away from moderation. It is difficult then for a rich man to be moderate, or for a moderate man to be rich.<note anchored="true"><q rend="single">How hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of God.</q> Mark x. 23 (Mrs. Carter). This expression in Mark sets forth the danger of riches, a fact which all men know who use their observation. In the next verse the truth is expressed in this form, <q rend="single">How hard it is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God.</q> The Stoics viewed wealth as among the things which are indifferent, neither good nor bad.</note> <pb n="410"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="22"> 
  <p>As if you were begotten or born in a ship, you would not be eager to be the master of it (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κυβερνήτης</foreign>), so—.<note anchored="true">The other member of the comparison has been omitted by some accident in the MSS. Wolf in his Latin version supplied by conjecture the omission in this manner: <quote xml:lang="lat" ><q rend="single">ita neque in terris divitiae tibi expe tendae sunt.</q></quote> Schweig.</note> For neither there (in the ship) will the ship naturally be connected with you, nor wealth in the other case; but reason is every where naturally connected with you. As then reason is a thing which naturally belongs to you and is born in you, consider this also as specially your own and take care of it.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="23"> 
<p>If you had been born among the Persians, you would not have wished to live in Hellas (Greece), but to have lived in Persia happy: so if you are born in poverty, why do you seek to grow rich, and why do you not remain in poverty and be happy?<note anchored="true">To some persons the comparison will not seem apt. Also the notion that every man should be taught to rise above the condition in which he is born is, in the opinion of some persons, a better teaching I think that it is not. Few persons have the talents and the character which enable them to rise from a low condition; and the proper lesson for them is to) stay in the condition in which they are born and to be content with it. Those who have the power of rising from a low condition will rise whether they are advised to attempt it or not: and generally they will not be able to rise without doing something useful to society. Those who have ability sufficient to raise themselves from a low estate, and at the same time to do it to the damage of society, are perhaps only few, but certainly there are such persons. They rise by ability, by the use of fraud, by bad means almost innumerable. They gain wealth, they fill high places, they disturb society, they are plagues and pests, and the world looks on sometimes with stupid admiration until death removes the dazzling and deceitful image, and honest men breathe freely again 
<p>In the Church of England Catechism there are two answers to two questions, one on our duty to God, the other on our duty to our neighbour. Both the answers would be accepted by Epictetus, except such few words as were not applicable to the circumstances of his age. The second answer ends with the words <q rend="single">to learn and labour to get mine own living and to do my duty in that state of life unto which it shall please God to call me.</q></p></note> <pb n="411"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="24"> 
<p>As it is better to lie compressed it a narrow bed and be healthy than to be tossed with disease on a broad couch, so also it is better to contract yourself within a small competence and to be happy than to have a great fortune and to be wretched.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="25"> 
  <p>It is not poverty which produces sorrow, but desire; nor does wealth release from fear, but reason (the power of reasoning, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογισμός</foreign>). If then you acquire this power of reasoning, you will neither desire wealth nor complain of poverty.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="26"> 
  <p>Neither is a horse elated nor proud of his manger and trappings and coverings, nor a bird of his little shreds of cloth and of his nest: but both of them are proud of their swiftness, one proud of the swiftness of the feet, and the other of the wings. Do you also then not be greatly proud of your food and dress and, in short, of any external things, but be proud of your integrity and good deeds (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐποιία</foreign>).</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="27"> 
  <p>To live well differs from living extravagantly: for the first comes from moderation and a sufficiency (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐταρκείας</foreign>) and good order and propriety and frugality; but the other comes from intemperance and luxury and want of order and want of propriety. And the end (the consequence) of the one is true praise, but of the other blame. If then you wish to live well, do not seek to be commended for profuse expenditure.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="28"> 
<p>Let the measure to you of all food and drink be the first satisfying of the desire; and let the food and the pleasure be the desire (appetite) itself: and you will neither take more than is necessary, nor will you want cooks, and you will be satisfied with the drink that comes in the way. <pb n="412"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="29"> 
<p>Make your manner of eating neither luxurious nor gloomy, but lively and frugal, that the soul may not be perturbed through being deceived by the pleasures of the body, and that it may despise them; and that the soul may not be injured by the enjoyment of present luxury, and the body may not afterwards suffer from disease.<note anchored="true">Mrs. Carter says, <q rend="single">I have not translated this fragment, because I do not understand it.</q> Schweighaeuser says also that he does not understand it. I have given what may be the meaning; but it is not an exact translation, which in the present state of the text is not possible.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="30"> 
  <p>Take care that the food which you put into the stomach does not fatten (nourish) you, but the cheerfulness of the mind: for the food is changed into excrement, and ejected, and the urine also flows out at the same time; but the cheerfulness, even if the soul be separated, remains always uncorrupted.<note anchored="true">This fragment is perhaps more corrupt than XXIX. See Schweig.’s note. I see no sense in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπαινος</foreign>, and I have used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖρος</foreign>, which is a possible reading. The conclusion appears quite unintelligible.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="31"> 
<p>In banquets remember that you entertain two guests, body and soul: and whatever you shall have given to the body you soon eject: but what you shall have given to the soul, you keep always.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="32"> 
<p>Do not mix anger with profuse expenditure and serve them up to your guests. Profusion which fills the body is quickly gone; but anger sinks into the soul and remains for a long time. Consider then that you be not transported with anger and insult your guests at a great expense; but rather please them with frugality and by gentle behaviour.<note anchored="true">See Schweig.’s note.</note> <pb n="413"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="33"> 
<p>In your banquets (meals) take care that those who serve (your slaves) are not more than those who are served; for it is foolish for many souls (persons) to wait on a few couches (seats).</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="34"> 
<p>It is best if even in the preparations for a feast you take a part of the labour, and at the enjoyment of the food, while you are feasting, you share with those who serve the things which are before you. But if such behaviour be unsuitable to the occasion, remember that you are served when you are not labouring by those who are labouring, when you are eating by those who are not eating, when you are drinking by those who are not drinking, while you are talking by those who are silent, while you are at ease by those who are under constraint; and if you remember this, you will neither being heated with anger be guilty of any absurdity yourself, nor by irritating another will you cause any mischief.<note anchored="true">I am not sure about the exact meaning of the conclusion. See Schweig.’s note.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="35"> 
<p>Quarrelling and contention are every where foolish, and particularly in talk over wine they are unbecoming: for a man who is drunk could not teach a man who is sober, nor on the other hand could a drunken man be convinced by a sober man. But where there is not sobriety, it will appear that to no purpose have you laboured for the result of persuasion.<note anchored="true">This is not a translation of the conclusion. Perhaps it is some. thing like the meaning. See Schweig.’s note.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="36"> 
<p>Grasshoppers (cicadae) are musical: snails have no voice. Snails have pleasure in being moist, but grasshoppers in being dry. Next the dew invites forth the snails and for this they crawl out: but on the contrary the sun when he is hot, rouses the grasshoppers and they sing in the sun. Therefore if you wish to be a musical <pb n="414"/> man and to harmonize well with others, when over the cups the soul is bedewed with wine, at that time do not permit the soul to go forth and to be polluted; but when in company (parties) it is fired by reason, then bid her to matter oracular words and to sing the oracles of justice.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="37"> 
<p>Examine in three ways him who is talking with you, as superior, or as inferior, or as equal: and if he is supe- rior, you should listen to him and be convinced by him: but if he is inferior, you should convince him; if he is equal, you should agree with him; and thus you will never be guilty of being quarrelsome.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="38"> 
<p>It is better by assenting to truth to conquer opinion, than by assenting to opinion to be conquered by truth.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="39"> 
<p>If you seek truth, you will not seek by every means to gain a victory; and if you have found truth, you will have the gain of not being defeated.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="40"> 
<p>Truth conquers with itself; but opinion conquers among those who are external.<note anchored="true">This is not clear.</note></p> </div>

<p>It is better to live with one free man and to be without fear and free, than to be a slave with many.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="42"> 
<p>What you avoid suffering, do not attempt to make others suffer. You avoid slavery: take care that others are not your slaves. For if you endure to have a slave, you appear to be a slave yourself first. For vice has no community with virtue, nor freedom with slavery. <pb n="415"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="43"> 
<p>As he who is in health would not choose to be served (ministered to) by the sick, nor for those who dwell with him to be sick, so neither would a free man endure to be served by slaves, or for those who live with him to be slaves.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="44"> 
<p>Whoever you are who wish to be not among the number of slaves, release yourself from slavery: and you will be free, if you are released from desire. For neither Aristides nor Epaminondas nor Lycurgus through being rich and served by slaves were named the one just, the other a god, and the third a saviour, but because they were poor and delivered Hellas (Greece) from slavery.<note anchored="true">It is observed that the term <q rend="single">just</q> applies to Aristides; the term <q rend="single">god</q> was given to Lycurgus by the Pythia or Delphic oracle; the name <q rend="single">saviour</q> by his own citizens to Epaminondas.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="45"> 
  <p>If you wish your house to be well managed, imitate the Spartan Lycurgus. For as he did not fence his city with walls, but fortified the inhabitants by virtue and preserved the city always free;<note anchored="true">Schweig. quotes Polybius ix. 10, 1, <q rend="single">a city is not adorned by external things, but by the virtue of those who dwell in it.</q> Alcaeus says, 22, Bergk, Poetae Lyrici Graeci, <date when="1843">1843</date>,— <quote xml:lang="grc"><lg> <l>ou) li/foi</l> <l>teixe/wn eu)= dedoma/menoi,</l> <l>a)ll’ a)/ndres to/lios pu/rgos a)rh/i+oi</l> </lg></quote></note> so do you not cast around (your house) a large court and raise high towers, but strengthen the dwellers by good will and fidelity and friendship, and then nothing harmful will enter it, not even if the whole band of wickedness shall array itself against it.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="46"> 
  <p>Do not hang your house round with tablets and pictures, but decorate it with moderation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>): for the one is of a foreign (unsuitable) kind, and a temporary deception of the eyes; but the other is a natural and indelible, and perpetual ornament of the house. <pb n="416"/></p> </div>

<p>As a wolf resembles a dog, so both a flatterer, and an adulterer and a parasite, resemble a friend. Take care then that instead of watch dogs you do not without knowing it let in mischievous wolves.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="49"> 
<p>To be eager that your house should be admired by being whitened with gypsum, is the mark of a man who has no taste: but to set off (decorate) our morals by the goodness of our communication (social habits) is the mark of a man who is a lover of beauty and a lover of man.</p> </div>

What is reasonable then and in our power is this, for our judgment not to be the only thing which resists it (the universe): for it is strong and superior, and it has determined better about us by administering (governing) us also together with the whole. And besides, this opposition also is unreasonable and does nothing more than cause us to be tormented uselessly and to fall into pain and sorrow.</p>

   <p>Of the things which are, God has put some of them in our power, and some he has not. In our own power he has placed that which is the best and the most important, that indeed through which he himself is happy, the use of appearances (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασιῶν</foreign>). For when this use is rightly employed, there is freedom, happiness, tranquillity, constancy: and this is also justice and law, and temperance, and every virtue. But all other things he has not placed in our power. Wherefore we also ought to be of one mind with God, and making this division of things, to look after those which are in our power; and of the things not in our power, to intrust them to the Universe (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ κόσμῳ</foreign>), and whether it should require our children, or our country, or our body, or any thing else, willingly to give them up.<note anchored="true">This is a valuable fragment, and I think, a genuine fragment of Epictetus.

      <p>When Archelaus was sending for Socrates to make him rich, Socrates told the messengers to return this answer: At Athens four measures (choenices) of meal are sold for one obolus (the sixth of a drachme), and the fountains run with water: if what I have is not enough (sufficient) for me, yet I am sufficient for what I have, and so it becomes sufficient for me. Do you not see that it was with no nobler voice that Polus acted the part of Oedipus as king than of Oedipus as a wanderer and beggar at Colonus? Then shall the good man appear to be inferior to Polus, and unable to act well every character (personage) imposed on him by the Deity? and shall he not imitate Ulysses, who even in rags made no worse figure than in the soft purple robe?<note anchored="true">See Schweig.’s note on this fragment; and his remark on this words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ εὐφωνότερον οὐδὲν</foreign>, and his proposed emendation.</note> </p> </div>

For these things are perhaps incomprehensible to the human mind: and if any man should even suppose them to be in the highest degree comprehensible, what then is the profit of them, if they are comprehended? And must we not say that those men have needless trouble who assign these things as necessary to the philosopher’s discourse? Is then also the precept written at Delphi superfluous, which is Know thyself? It is not so, he says. What then is the meaning of it?
