<p>A life at odds with Fortune resembles a wintry torrent; for it is turbulent and muddy and difficult to pass, and violent and noisy and brief.</p> 
<p>A soul conversant with virtue resembles a perpetual fountain; for it is clear and gentle and agreeable and sweet and serviceable and rich and harmless and innocent.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="2"> 
<p>If you would be good, first believe that you are bad.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="3"> 
<p>It is better sometimes frankly to offend, and act often wisely, than to say we seldom err and offend frequently. <pb n="p.248"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="4"> 
<p>Chastise your passions, that they may not chastise you.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="5"> 
<p>Be not so much ashamed of what is inglorious, as studious to shun what is untruthful.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="6"> 
<p>If you would be well spoken of, learn to speak well of others. And when you have learned to speak well, endeavor likewise to do well; and thus you will reap the fruit of being well spoken of.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="7"> 
<p>Freedom and slavery are merely names of virtue and of vice; and both these are matters of will. But neither of them belongs to things in which will has no share. But Fortune is accustomed to dispose at her pleasure of the body, and those things relating to the body in which will has no share. For no one is a slave whose will is free.</p> 
<p>Fortune is an evil chain to the body, and vice to the soul. For he whose body is unbound, and whose soul is chained, is a slave. On the contrary, he whose body is chained, and his soul unbound, is free. The chain of the body, Nature unbinds by death, or baseness for money; the chain of the soul, virtue unbinds by wisdom and experience and philosophic training. <pb n="p.249"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="8"> 
<p>If you would live tranquil and contented, endeavor that all who live with you may be good. And you can have them good by instructing the willing and dismissing the unwilling. For sin and bondage will fly with those who leave you, and with those who remain with you will virtue and liberty be left.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="9"> 
<p>It is scandalous that he who sweetens his drink by the gift of the bees, should by vice embitter reason, the gift of the gods.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="10"> 
<p>No one who is a lover of money, a lover of pleasure, or a lover of glory, is likewise a lover of mankind; but only he who is a lover of virtue.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="11"> 
<p>As you would not wish to sail in a large and elegant and gilded ship, and sink; so neither is it desirable to inhabit a grand and sumptuous house, and be in a tumult.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="12"> 
<p>When we are invited to an entertainment we take what we find; and if any one should bid the master of the house set fish or tarts before him, he would be thought absurd. Yet in the world we ask the gods <pb n="p.250"/> for what they do not give us; and that, though there are so many things which they have given us.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="13"> 
<p>They are pretty fellows indeed, said he, who value themselves on things not in our own power. I am a better man than you, says one; for I have many estates, and you are pining with hunger. I have been consul, says another; I am a ruler, says a third; and I have a fine head of hair, says a fourth. Yet one horse does not say to another, <q rend="double">I am better than you, for I have a great deal of hay and a great deal of oats, and I have a gold bridle and embroidered trappings;</q> but only, <q rend="double">I am swifter than you.</q> And every creature is better or worse from its own good or bad qualities. Is man, then, the only creature which has no natural good quality? And must we take account of hair and clothes and ancestors?</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="14"> 
<p>Patients are displeased with a physician who does not prescribe to them; and think he gives them over. And why are none so affected towards a philosopher as to conclude that he despairs of their recovery to a right way of thinking, if he tells them nothing for their good?</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="15"> 
<p>They who have a good constitution of body can bear heat and cold; and so they who have a right <pb n="p.251"/> constitution of soul can meet anger and grief and immoderate joy and the other passions.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="16"> 
<p>Examine yourself, whether you had rather be rich or happy. And if rich, be assured that this is neither a good, nor altogether in your own power; but if happy, that this is both a good, and in your own power; since the one is a temporary loan of Fortune, and the other depends on will.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="17"> 
<p>As when you see a viper, or an asp, or a scorpion in a box of ivory or gold, you do not love it or think it happy because of the magnificence of the material in which it is enclosed, but you shun and detest it, because it is of a pernicious nature; so, likewise, when you see vice lodged in the midst of wealth, and the swelling pride of fortune, be not struck by the splendor of the material with which it is surrounded; but despise the base alloy of its manners.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="18"> 
<p>Riches are not among the number of things which are good; prodigality is of the number of those which are evil; modesty of those which are good. Now modesty invites to frugality and the acquisition of things that are good; but riches invite to prodigality and seduce from modesty. It is difficult, therefore, <pb n="p.252"/> for a rich person to be modest, or a modest person rich.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="19"> 
<p>If you had been born and bred in a ship, you would not be impatient to become the pilot. For you are not necessarily identified with the ship there, nor with riches here; but with reason everywhere. That therefore which is natural and congenial to you, reason, think likewise to be peculiarly your own, and take care of it.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="20"> 
<p>If you were born in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, you would not endeavor to live in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, but to be happy in the place where you were. Why, then, if you are born in poverty, do you yearn to be rich, and not rather to be happy in the condition where you are?</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="21"> 
<p>As it is better to lie straitened for room upon a little couch in health, than to toss upon a wide bed in sickness, so it is better to contract yourself within the compass of a small fortune, and be happy, than to have a great one and be wretched.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="22"> 
<p>It is not poverty that causes sorrow, but covetous desires; nor do riches deliver from fear, but only reasoning. If therefore you acquire a habit of reasoning, you will neither desire riches, nor complain of poverty. <pb n="p.253"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="23"> 
<p>A horse is not elated, and does not value himself on his fine stable or trappings or saddle-cloths, nor a bird on the warm materials of its nest; but the former on the swiftness of his feet, and the latter of its wings. Do not you, therefore, glory in your food or dress, or in short any external advantage, but in integrity and beneficence.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="24"> 
<p>There is a difference between living well and living profusely. The one arises from contentment and order and propriety and frugality; the other from dissoluteness and luxury and disorder and indecency. In short, to the one belongs true praise; to the other, censure. If therefore you would live well, do not seek to be praised for profuseness.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="25"> 
<p>Let the first satisfaction of appetite be always the measure to you of eating and drinking; and appetite itself the sauce and the pleasure. Thus you will never take more than is necessary, nor will you want cooks; and you will be contented with whatever drink falls in your way.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="26"> 
<p>Consider that you do not thrive merely by the food in your stomach; but by the elevation of your soul. <pb n="p.254"/> For the former, as you see, is evacuated and carried off altogether; but the latter, though the soul be parted, remains uncorrupted through all things.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="27"> 
<p>In every feast remember that there are two guests to be entertained, the body and the soul; and that what you give the body you presently lose, but what you give the soul remains forever.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="28"> 
<p>Do not mingle anger with profusion, and set them before your guests. Profusion, when it has made its way through the body, is quickly gone; but anger, when it has penetrated the soul, abides for a long time. Take care not to pay a great price merely to be transported with anger, and affront your guests; but rather delight them at a cheap rate by gentle behavior.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="29"> 
<p>Take care at your meals that the attendants be not more in number than those whom they are to attend. For it is absurd that many persons should wait on a few chairs.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="30"> 
<p>It would be best if, both while you are personally making your preparations and while you are feasting at table, you could give among the servants part of what is before you. But if such a thing be difficult <pb n="p.255"/> at that time, remember that you, who are not weary, are attended by those who are; you who are eating and drinking, by those who are not; you who are talking, by those who are silent; you who are at ease, by those who are under constraint; and thus you will never be heated into any unreasonable passion yourself, nor do any mischief by provoking another.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="31"> 
<p>Strife and contention are always absurd, but particularly unbecoming at table conversations. For a person warmed with wine will never either teach, or be convinced by, one who is sober. And wherever sobriety is wanting, the end will show that you have exerted yourself to no purpose.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="32"> 
<p>Grasshoppers are musical; but snails are dumb. The latter rejoice in being wet; and the former in being warm. Then the dew calls out the one race, and for this they come forth; but, on the contrary, the noonday sun awakens the others, and in this they sing. If therefore you.would be a musical and harmonious person, whenever the soul is bedewed with wine at drinking-parties, suffer her not to go forth and defile herself. But when in rational society she glows by the beams of reason, then command her to speak from inspiration, and utter the oracles of justice. <pb n="p.256"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="33"> 
<p>Consider him with whom you converse in one of these three ways: either as your superior, or inferior, or equal. If superior, you ought to hear him and be convinced; if inferior, to convince him; if equal, to agree with him; and thus you will never be led into the love of strife.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="34"> <p/> <p rend="right">It is better, by yielding to truth, to conquer prejudice, than by yielding to principle to be defeated by truth.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="35"> 
<p>If you seek truth, you will not seek merely victory at all hazards; and when you have found truth, you will have a security against being conquered.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="36"> 
<p>Truth conquers by itself; prejudice, by appealing to externals.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="37"> 
<p>It is better, through living with one free person, to be fearless and free, than to be a slave in company with many.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="38"> <p/> <p rend="right">What you avoid suffering yourself, seek not to impose on others. You avoid slavery, for instance; take care not to enslave. For if you can bear to <pb n="p.257"/> exact slavery from others, you appear to have been yourself a slave. For vice has nothing in common with virtue, nor freedom with slavery. As a person in health would not wish to be attended by the sick, nor to have those who live with him in a state of sickness; so neither would a person who is free bear to be served by slaves, nor to have those who live with him in a state of slavery.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="39"> 
<p>Whoever you are that would live apart from slaves, deliver yourself from slavery. And you will be free if you deliver yourself from appetite. For neither was Aristides called just, nor Epaminondas divine, nor Lycurgus a preserver, because they were rich and slave-holders; but because, being poor, they delivered <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName> from slavery.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="40"> 
<p>If you would have your house securely inhabited, imitate the Spartan Lycurgus. And as he did not enclose his city with walls, but fortified the inhabitants with virtue, and preserved the city always free; so do you, likewise, not surround yourself with a great court-yard, nor raise high towers, but strengthen those who live with you by benevolence and fidelity and friendship. And thus nothing hurtful will enter, even if the whole band of wickedness be set in array against it. <pb n="p.258"/></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="41"> 
<p>Do not hang your house round with tablets and pictures, but adorn it with virtue. For those are merely foreign and a fading deception of the eyes; but this, a congenial and indelible and perpetual ornament to the house.</p> </div>

<p>Instead of herds of oxen, endeavor to assemble flocks of friends about your house.</p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="44"> 
<p>To seek admiration by adorning one's house with stucco belongs to a tasteless man; but to adorn our characters by the charm of an amiable nature shows at once a lover of beauty and a lover of man.</p> </div>

<p>Nothing is meaner than the love of pleasure, the love of gain, and insolence. Nothing is nobler than magnanimity, meekness, and philanthropy.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="47"> 
<p>[We represent] those intractable philosophers who do not think pleasure to be in itself the natural state of man, but merely an incident of those things in which his natural state consists,—justice, moderation, and freedom. Why, then, should the soul rejoice and be glad in the minor blessings of the body, as Epicurus says, and not be pleased with its own good, which is the very greatest? And yet Nature has given me likewise a sense of shame; and I am covered with blushes, when I think I have uttered any indecent expression. This emotion will not suffer me to recognize pleasure as a good and the end of life.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="sentence" n="48"> 
  <p>The ladies at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> have Plato’s Republic in their hands, because he allows a community of wives; for they attend merely to the words of the author, and not to his sense. For he does not first order one man and one woman to marry and live together, and then allow a community of wives; but he abolishes that system of marriage, and introduces one of another kind. And, in general, men are pleased in <pb n="p.260"/> ending out excuses for their own faults. Yet philosophy says it is not fit even to move a finger without 30me reason.</p> </div>

<p>Agrippinus was justly entitled to praise on this account, that, though he was a man of the highest worth, he never praised himself, but blushed even if another praised him.
