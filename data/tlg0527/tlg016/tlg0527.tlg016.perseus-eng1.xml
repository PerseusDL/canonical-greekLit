                    <p>
                        Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and
Yahweh his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of
hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the
heads of the fathers' [houses].
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        So Solomon, and all the assembly
with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the
tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in
the wilderness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        But the ark of God had David brought up from
Kiriath Jearim to [the place] that David had prepared for it; for he
had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Moreover the brazen
altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there
before the tent of Yahweh: and Solomon and the assembly sought to it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Solomon went up there to the brazen altar before Yahweh, which
was at the tent of meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        In that night did God appear to Solomon, and said to him, Ask
what I shall give you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Solomon said to God, You have shown great
lovingkindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be
established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of
the earth in multitude.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I
may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your
people, that is so great?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        God said to Solomon, Because this was
in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the
life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have
asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people,
over whom I have made you king:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        wisdom and knowledge is granted
to you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none
of the kings have had who have been before you; neither shall there any
after you have the like.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        So Solomon came from the high place
that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem; and
he reigned over Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen:
and he had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at
Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as
stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the
lowland, for abundance.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        The horses which Solomon had were
brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the king's merchants  purchased them
from Kue.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for
six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty: and so
for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they
bring them out by their means.

                    <p>
                        Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh,
and a house for his kingdom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Solomon counted out seventy thousand
men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in
the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you did deal
with David my father, and did send him cedars to build him a house to
dwell therein, [even so deal with me].
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Behold, I am about to
build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, and
to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual show
bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the
Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our
God. This is [an ordinance] forever to Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        The house which I
build is great; for great is our God above all gods.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But who is
able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens
can't contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save
only to burn incense before him?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Now therefore send me a man
skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and
in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave [all
manner of] engravings, [to be] with the skillful men who are with me in
Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Send me
also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon; for I
know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold,
my servants shall be with your servants,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        even to prepare me
timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be
great and wonderful.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Behold, I will give to your servants, the
cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and
twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine,
and twenty thousand baths of oil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Then Huram the king of Tyre
answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Yahweh loves his
people, he has made you king over them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Huram said moreover,
Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who
has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and
understanding, that should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for
his kingdom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with
understanding, of Huram my father's,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        the son of a woman of the
daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in
gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in
purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any
manner of engraving, and to devise any device; that there may be [a
place] appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful
men of my lord David your father.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Now therefore the wheat and
the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him
send to his servants:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as
much as you shall need; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to
Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Solomon numbered
all the sojourners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering
with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found one
hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        He set seventy
thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone
cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to
set the people at work.

                    <p>
                        Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem
on Mount Moriah, where [Yahweh] appeared to David his father, which he
made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing
floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        He began to build in the second
[day] of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Now
these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the
house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty
cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        The porch that was before
[the house], the length of it, according to the breadth of the house,
was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid
it within with pure gold.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        The greater house he made a ceiling
with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and worked thereon
palm trees and chains.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He garnished the house with precious
stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        He overlaid
also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls of it, and the
doors of it, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        He
made the most holy house: the length of it, according to the breadth of
the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits; and
he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the
upper chambers with gold.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        In the most holy house he made two
cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        The
wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one
[cherub] was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the
other wing was [likewise] five cubits, reaching to the wing of the
other cherub.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        The wing of the other cherub was five cubits,
reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits
[also], joining to the wing of the other cherub.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The wings of
these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on
their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        He made the
veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and worked
cherubim thereon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Also he made before the house two pillars of
thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of
them was five cubits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        He made chains in the oracle, and put
[them] on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred
pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        He set up the pillars
before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left;
and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of
that on the left Boaz.

                    <p>
                        Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the height
of it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to
brim, round in compass; and the height of it was five cubits; and a
line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Under it was the
likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits,
compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it
was cast.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the

                        and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the

                        The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were

bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and
worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, [saying], For he is good; for his
lovingkindness endures for ever.

                        King Solomon offered a sacrifice

So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

                        The

instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give
thanks to Yahweh, (for his lovingkindness endures for ever,) when David
praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before

                        Moreover Solomon made the middle of
the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he
offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings,
because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
the burnt offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.

Egypt.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they

                        On the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the

that Yahweh had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh, and the

                        Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your

                        It happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had

                        with twelve hundred chariots, and

                        He

                        Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the
princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of
Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You have forsaken me,
therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.

                        Then the

Yahweh is righteous.

                        When Yahweh saw that they humbled
themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, They have
humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some

                        So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,

                        King Rehoboam made in their place

                        It was so,

                        When he humbled himself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from him,

                        So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in

                        Moreover Amaziah gathered
Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses,
under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah
and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward,
and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to
war, who could handle spear and shield.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He hired also one

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But there came a man of God to him, saying, O

Israel, [to wit], with all the children of Ephraim.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But if you

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? The man of
God answered, Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that had come to him
out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly
kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley
of Salt, and struck of the children of Seir ten thousand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        [other] ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and
brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of
the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But the men
of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to
battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon,
and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Now it
happened, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the
Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set
them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned
incense to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled
against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why
have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered
their own people out of your hand?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        It happened, as he talked
with him, that [the king] said to him, Have we made you of the king's
counsel? Stop! Why should you be struck down? Then the prophet stopped,
and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you
have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Then
Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of

                        Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king
of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar
that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife: and
there passed by a wild animal that was in Lebanon, and trod down the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        You say, Behold, you have struck Edom; and your heart

                        But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might
deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they had sought
after the gods of Edom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        So Joash king of Israel went up; and he

                        Judah was put to the

                        Joash
king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of

                        Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the

                        he took counsel with his princes and

                        Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid nor dismayed for the

                        Don't you

                        Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the

                        It happened, when the king had heard the words of the law, that

                        The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the

                        Go you, inquire of Yahweh

                        Josiah gave to the children of

                        His princes gave for a freewill- offering to the people, to the

                        They killed

                        They removed the

                        Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the

abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Yahweh
which he had made holy in Jerusalem.

                        Yahweh, the God of their
fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending,
because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Yahweh arose against
his people, until there was no remedy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Therefore he brought on
them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the
sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young
man or virgin, old man or gray-headed: he gave them all into his hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        All the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the
treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king, and of
his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        They burnt the
house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the
palaces of it with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Those who had escaped from the sword carried he away to
Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of
the kingdom of Persia:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the
mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths: [for] as
long as it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of
Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred
up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation
throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and he has charged me to build
him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you
of all his people, Yahweh his God be with him, and let him go up.
