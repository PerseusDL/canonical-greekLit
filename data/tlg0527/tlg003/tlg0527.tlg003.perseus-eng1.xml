                        their iniquity; <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/> then will I remember my

                        their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy
                        them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;
                            <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/> but I will for their sakes remember the

                        in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Yahweh.
                            <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/> These are the statutes and ordinances

                        from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
                            <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/> All the tithe of the land, whether of
                        the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh's: it is holy
                        to Yahweh. <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/> If a man will redeem anything of

                        These are the commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of
