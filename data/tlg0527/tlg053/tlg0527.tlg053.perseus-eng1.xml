                        Now it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month],
in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the
river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king
Jehoiachin's captivity,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        the word of Yahweh came expressly to
Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by
the river Chebar; and the hand of Yahweh was there on him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        I
looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great
cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness round about it, and
out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of
the fire.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living
creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Everyone had four faces, and everyone of them had four wings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was
like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
sides; and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        their wings were joined one to another; they didn't turn when they
went; they went everyone straight forward.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        As for the likeness
of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face
of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the
left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Their faces
and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of everyone were
joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        They went
everyone straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they
didn't turn when they went.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        As for the likeness of the living
creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the
appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living
creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth
lightning.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The living creatures ran and returned as the
appearance of a flash of lightning.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Now as I saw the living
creatures, behold, one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures,
for each of the four faces of it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        The appearance of the wheels
and their work was like a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and
their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't
turn when they went.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        As for their rims, they were high and
dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when
the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were
lifted up.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was
the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        When those
went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those
were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them:
for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Over
the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse,
like the awesome crystal to look on, stretched forth over their heads
above.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one
toward the other: everyone had two which covered on this side, and
every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        When
they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great
waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the
noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when
they stood, they let down their wings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Above the expanse that
was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of
a sapphire stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as
the appearance of a man on it above.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        I saw as it were glowing
metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the
appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his
loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there
was brightness round about him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        As the appearance of the bow
that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the
glory of Yahweh. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice
of one that spoke.

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me,
and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        He said
to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to nations
that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their
fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        The
children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I do sent you to them; and you
shall tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        They, whether they
will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious
house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        You, son of man, don't be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their
words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you do dwell among
scorpions: don't be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their
looks, though they are a rebellious house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        You shall speak my
words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear;
for they are most rebellious.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But you, son of man, hear what I
tell you; don't be you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your
mouth, and eat that which I give you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        When I looked, behold, a
hand was put forth to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was therein;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        He spread it before me: and it was written within and without;
and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

                    <p>
                        He said to me, Son of man, eat that which you find; eat this
scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        So I opened my
mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        He said to me, Son of
man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll
that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for
sweetness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        He said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of
Israel, and speak with my words to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For you are not sent to
a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house
of Israel;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard
language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, if I sent you to
them, they would listen to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But the house of Israel will not
listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of
Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Behold, I have
made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against
their foreheads.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        As an adamant harder than flint have I made your
forehead: don't be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks,
though they are a rebellious house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Moreover he said to me, Son
of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart,
and hear with your ears.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Go, get you to them of the captivity,
to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus
says the Lord Yahweh; whether they will hear, or whether they will
forbear.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the
voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from
his place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living
creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels
beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        So the Spirit
lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat
of my spirit; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Then I
came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river
Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them
seven days.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        It happened at the end of seven days, that the word
of Yahweh came to me, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Son of man, I have made you a
watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth,
and give them warning from me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        When I tell the wicked, You shall
surely die; and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked
from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in
his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Yet if
you warn the wicked, and he doesn't turn from his wickedness, nor from
his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered
your soul.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Again, when a righteous man does turn from his
righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before
him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die
in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be
remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin,
and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and

sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell there on me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Then I saw, and, behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the

                        He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my

brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate
of the inner [court] that looks toward the north; where was the seat of
the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.

                        Behold, the

                        Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your

toward the north, and see, northward of the gate of the altar this
image of jealousy in the entry.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He said to me, Son of man, see

                        He brought me to

                        Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I

                        He said to me, Go in, and

                        So I went in and

                        There stood before them seventy men of the elders of the

Yahweh has forsaken the land.

                        Then he

                        He brought me into the

Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men,
with their backs toward the temple of Yahweh, and their faces toward
the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.

                        You are different from [other] women in your prostitution, in

                        I will also give you into

                        They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall

                        There was also another great eagle with great

                        As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely in the place

                        Moreover also I swore to them

lands;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        because they rejected my ordinances, and didn't walk in

                        Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn't destroy

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I said to their children in the wilderness, Don't you walk in the

yourselves with their idols.

                        But the children rebelled
against me; they didn't walk in my statutes, neither kept my ordinances
to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my

my anger against them in the wilderness.

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        Moreover also I gave them statutes

                        and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to

desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.

                        Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them,

                        For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to
give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and
they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the
provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor,
and they poured out there their drink-offerings.

                        Son of

                        and they

                        The names of them were Oholah the

                        She bestowed her

                        Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt; for in

                        Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of

                        She

                        These things shall be done to

                        You have walked in

                        Thus says the Lord Yahweh: You shall drink of your sister's
cup, which is deep and large; you shall be laughed to scorn and had in
derision; it contains much.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        You shall be filled with

with the cup of your sister Samaria.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        You shall even drink it

                        Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because you have forgotten me, and

your prostitution.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Yahweh said moreover to me: Son of man, will

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands;
and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also
caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] to

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        Moreover this they have done to me: they

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        For when they had slain their children to their

and, behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        Furthermore you have sent for men who come from far, to whom a

                        The voice of a multitude

                        Then said I of her who was old in adulteries, Now will they play the

                        They went in to her,

                        Righteous men, they shall judge them

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        For thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will bring up a company

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        The company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch

                        Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and,
behold, it has not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines, to put
a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king

broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        I

                        I will strengthen the arms of the king

Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly

                        I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon;
and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am
Yahweh, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,
and he shall stretch it out on the land of Egypt.

                        It happened in the eleventh year, in the third [month], in
the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me,
saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his
multitude: Whom are you like in your greatness?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Behold, the
Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, and with a
forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick
boughs.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the
rivers of it ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its
channels to all the trees of the field.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Therefore its stature
was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were
multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when
it shot [them] forth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        All the birds of the sky made their nests
in its boughs; and under its branches did all the animals of the field
bring forth their young; and under its shadow lived all great nations.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Thus was it beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its
branches; for its root was by many waters.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The cedars in the
garden of God could not hide it; the fir trees were not like its
boughs, and the plane trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree
in the garden of God like it in its beauty.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        I made it beautiful
by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that
were in the garden of God, envied it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Therefore thus said the
Lord Yahweh: Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top
among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the

                        Strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut
him off, and have left him: on the mountains and in all the valleys his
branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses
of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his
shadow, and have left him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        On his ruin all the birds of the sky
shall dwell, and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt
themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick
boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, [even] all
who drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the lower
parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with those who
go down to the pit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In the day when
he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him,
and I restrained the rivers of it; and the great waters were stayed;
and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field
fainted for him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        I made the nations to shake at the sound of
his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the
pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all
that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain
by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, [that] lived under his
shadow in the midst of the nations.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        To whom are you thus like
in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shall you be
brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth:
you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who are
slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the

was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Therefore I
poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on
the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        and
I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the

judged them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        When they came to the nations, where they went,
they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the
people of Yahweh, and are gone forth out of his land.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        But I had
regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among
the nations, where they went.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Therefore tell the house of
Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I don't do [this] for your sake,
house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among
the nations, where you went.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        I will sanctify my great name,
which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in

the Lord Yahweh, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out

                        A new

                        I will save

                        Then shall
you remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and
you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and
for your abominations.

                        Nor for your sake do I [this], says the

                        Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In the day

                        The land

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        Thus says the Lord Yahweh: For

                        He measured the length of it, twenty cubits, and the breadth,
twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This is the most
holy place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits;
and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the
house on every side.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The side-chambers were in three stories,
one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall
which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that
they might have hold [therein], and not have hold in the wall of the
house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The side-chambers were broader as they encompassed [the
house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher
and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house
[continued] upward; and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to
the highest by the middle [chamber].
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        I saw also that the house
had a raised base round about: the foundations of the side-chambers
were a full reed of six great cubits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        The thickness of the wall,
which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and
that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to
the house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits
round about the house on every side.

                        The doors of the
side-chambers were toward [the place] that was left, one door toward
the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the
place that was left was five cubits round about.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        The building
that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was
seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits
thick round about, and the length of it ninety cubits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        So he
measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place,
and the building, with the walls of it, one hundred cubits long;

                        He measured the
length of the building before the separate place which was at the back
of it, and the galleries of it on the one side and on the other side,
one hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

                        the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round
about on their three stories, over against the threshold, with wood

                        to [the space] above the door, even to

                        It was made with cherubim and palm

had two faces;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        so that there was the face of a man toward the
palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm
tree on the other side. [thus was it] made through all the house round
about:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm
trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.

                        As for the temple,
the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the
appearance [of it] was as the appearance [of the temple].
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        The
altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length of it two cubits;
and the corners of it, and the length of it, and the walls of it, were
of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

                        The doors
had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves: two [leaves] for the one
door, and two leaves for the other.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        There were made on them, on
the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on
the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch
outside.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        There were closed windows and palm trees on the one

                        Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the

                        For they were in three stories, and

                        In the

                        The way

                        Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south

                        He brought me back to the door of the house; and, behold,
waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for
the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came
down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the

                        Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward,

waters on the right side.

                        Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the

                        Afterward he measured one thousand; [and it was] a river
