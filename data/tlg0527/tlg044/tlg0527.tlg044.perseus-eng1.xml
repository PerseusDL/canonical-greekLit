                    <p>
                        The word of Yahweh which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi,
the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the
days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        I will utterly
sweep away everything off of the surface of the earth, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        I will sweep away man and animal. I will sweep away the birds of
the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble with the wicked.
I will cut off man from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        I
will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants
of Jerusalem. I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place: the
name of the idolatrous and pagan priests,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        those who worship the
host of the sky on the housetops, those who worship and swear by Yahweh
and also swear by Malcam,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        those who have turned back from
following Yahweh, and those who haven't sought Yahweh nor inquired
after him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh, for the
day of Yahweh is at hand. For Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice. He has
consecrated his guests.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        It will happen in the day of Yahweh's
sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, the king's sons, and all
those who as are clothed with foreign clothing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        In that day, I
will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their
master's house with violence and deceit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        In that day, says
Yahweh, there will be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, a wailing
from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are
undone! All those who were laden with silver are cut off.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        It
will happen at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and
I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs, who say in their
heart, "Yahweh will not do good, neither will he do evil."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Their
wealth will become a spoil, and their houses a desolation. Yes, they
will build houses, but won't inhabit them. They will plant vineyards,
but won't drink their wine.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The great day of Yahweh is near. It
is near, and hurries greatly, the voice of the day of Yahweh. The
mighty man cries there bitterly.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        That day is a day of wrath, a
day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of
darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        a day of the
trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high
battlements.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        I will bring distress on men, that they will walk
like blind men, because they have sinned against Yahweh, and their
blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the
day of Yahweh's wrath, but the whole land will be devoured by the fire
of his jealousy; for he will make an end, yes, a terrible end, of all
those who dwell in the land.

                    <p>
                        Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, you nation
that has no shame,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        before the appointed time when the day passes
as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you, before
the day of Yahweh's anger comes on you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Seek Yahweh, all you
humble of the land, who have kept his ordinances. Seek righteousness.
Seek humility. It may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh's
anger.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They
will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron will be rooted up.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites!
The word of Yahweh is against you, Canaan, the land of the Philistines.
I will destroy you, that there will be no inhabitant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The sea
coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for
flocks.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah.
They will find pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon, they will lie down
in the evening, for Yahweh, their God, will visit them, and restore
them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the
children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people, and
magnified themselves against their border.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Therefore as I live,
says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be as Sodom,
and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and
salt pits, and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of my people will
plunder them, and the survivors of my nation will inherit them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        This they will have for their pride, because they have reproached and
magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Yahweh will be awesome to them, for he will famish all the gods of the
land. Men will worship him, everyone from his place, even all the
shores of the nations.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        You Cushites also, you will be killed by
my sword.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        He will stretch out his hand against the north,
destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the
wilderness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Herds will lie down in the midst of her, all the
animals of the nations. Both the pelican and the porcupine will lodge
in its capitals. Their calls will echo through the windows. Desolation
will be in the thresholds, for he has laid bare the cedar beams.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart,
"I am, and there is none besides me." How she has become a desolation,
a place for animals to lie down in! Everyone who passes by her will
hiss, and shake their fists.

                        Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing
city!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        She didn't obey the voice. She didn't receive correction.
She didn't trust in Yahweh. She didn't draw near to her God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Her
princes in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening
wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Her prophets are
arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the
sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Yahweh, in the
midst of her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he
brings his justice to light. He doesn't fail, but the unjust know no
shame.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I
have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities
are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        I said, "Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling
won't be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning
her." But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        "Therefore wait for me," says Yahweh, "until the day that I rise up to
the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may
assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my
fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my
jealousy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that
they may all call on the name of Yahweh, to serve him shoulder to
shoulder.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even
the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        In
that day you will not be put to shame for all your doings, in which you
have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the
midst of you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be
haughty in my holy mountain.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But I will leave in the midst of
you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in the name
of Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak
lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they
will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice
with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Yahweh has taken
away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel,
Yahweh, is in the midst of you. You will not be afraid of evil any
more.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, "Don't be
afraid, Zion. Don't let your hands be slack."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Yahweh, your God,
is in the midst of you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice
over you with joy. He will rest in his love. He will rejoice over you
with singing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Those who are sad for the appointed feasts, I will
remove from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I
will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I
will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather
you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the
earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, says Yahweh.
