<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="13"><p>  I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. </p></div>

Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="17"><p>  I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="2"><p>  I said of laughter, <q rend="double">It is foolishness;</q> and of mirth, <q rend="double">What does it accomplish?</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="3"><p>  I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="4"><p>  I made myself great works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="5"><p>  I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="6"><p>  I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest where trees were reared. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="7"><p>  I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="8"><p>  I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men — musical instruments, and that of all sorts. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="9"><p>  So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="10"><p>  Whatever my eyes desired, I didn’t keep from them. I didn’t withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="11"><p>  Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="12"><p>  I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for what can the king’s successor do? Just that which has been done long ago. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="13"><p>  Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="14"><p>  The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness — and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="15"><p>  Then said I in my heart, <q rend="double">As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?</q> Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="16"><p>  For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool! </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="17"><p>  So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="18"><p>  I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes after me. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="19"><p>  Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="20"><p>  Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="21"><p>  For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="22"><p>  For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="23"><p>  For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="24"><p>  There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="25"><p>  For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg030.perseus-eng2:X" n="26"><p>  For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind. </p> </div> </div>
