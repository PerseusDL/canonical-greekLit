                        The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which
he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in
the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before
the earthquake.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        He said:
Yahweh will roar from Zion,
   And utter his voice from Jerusalem;
And the pastures of the shepherds will mourn,
   And the top of Carmel will.wither."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"For three transgressions of Damascus, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael,
   And it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I will break the bar of Damascus,
   And cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven,
   And him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden;
   And the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir,"
   says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because they carried away captive the whole community,
   To deliver them up to Edom;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza,
   And it will devour its palaces.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,
   And him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon;
And I will turn my hand against Ekron;
   And the remnant of the Philistines will perish,"
   says the Lord Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"For three transgressions of Tyre, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because they delivered up the whole community to Edom,
   And didn't remember the brotherly covenant;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre,
   And it will devour its palaces."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because he pursued his brother with the sword,
   And cast off all pity,
   And his anger raged continually,
   And he kept his wrath forever;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But I will send a fire on Teman,
   And it will devour the palaces of Bozrah."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead,
   That they may enlarge their border.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,
   And it will devour its palaces,
   With shouting in the day of battle,
   With a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        And their king will go into captivity,
   He and his princes together,"
   says Yahweh.

"For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        But I will send a fire on Moab,
   And it will devour the palaces of Kerioth;
   And Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of
      the trumpet;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        And I will cut off the judge from their midst,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because they have rejected Yaweh's law,
   And have not kept his statutes,
   And their lies have led them astray,
   After which their fathers walked;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four,
   I will not turn away its punishment;
   Because they have sold the righteous for silver,
   And the needy for a pair of shoes;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
   And deny justice to the oppressed;
   And a man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy
      name;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        And they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes
      taken in pledge;
   And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have
      been fined.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,
   Whose height was like the height of the cedars,
   And he was strong as the oaks;
   Yet I destroyed his fruit from above,
   and his roots from beneath.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,
   And led you forty years in the wilderness,
   To possess the land of the Amorite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        I raised up some of your sons for prophets,
   And some of your young men for Nazirites.
Isn't this true,
   You children of Israel?" says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        "But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink,
   And commanded the prophets, saying, 'Don't prophesy!'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Behold, I will crush you in your place,
   As a cart crushes that is full of grain.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Flight will perish from the swift;
   And the strong won't strengthen his force;
   Neither shall the mighty deliver himself;

                        Neither shall he stand who handles the bow;
   And he who is swift of foot won't escape;
   Neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        And he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked
      in that day,"
   says Yahweh.

                        Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, children of
Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of
Egypt, saying:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        "You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth.

                        Will a lion roar in the thicket,

Does a young lion cry out of his den,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth,
   Where no snare is set for him?
Does a snare spring up from the ground,
   When there is nothing to catch?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city,
   Without the people being afraid?
Does evil befall a city,
   And Yahweh hasn't done it?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing,
   Unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The lion has roared.
   Who will not fear?
The Lord Yahweh has spoken.
   Who can but prophesy?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,
   And in the palaces in the land of Egypt,
And say, "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,
   And see what unrest is in her,
   And what oppression is among them."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        "Indeed they don't know to do right," says Yahweh,
   "Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:
"An adversary will overrun the land;
   And he will pull down your strongholds,
   And your fortresses will be plundered."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Thus says Yahweh:
"As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs,
   Or a piece of an ear,
   So shall the children of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria on the
      corner of a couch,
   And on the silken cushions of a bed."

                        "Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob," says the
Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        "For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him,
   I will also visit the altars of Bethel;
   And the horns of the altar will be cut off,
   And fall to the ground.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        I will strike the winter house with the summer house;

                        "Go to Bethel, and sin;
   To Gilgal, and sin more.
Bring your sacrifices every morning,
   Your tithes every three days,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,
   And proclaim free will offerings and brag about them:
   For this pleases you, you children of Israel," says the Lord Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        "I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,

                        "I also have withheld the rain from you,
   When there were yet three months to the harvest;
   And I caused it to rain on one city,
   And caused it not to rain on another city.
One place was rained on,
   And the piece where it didn't rain withered.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water,
   And were not satisfied:
   Yet you haven't returned to me," says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens
      and your vineyards;
   And your fig trees and your olive trees have the swarming locust
      devoured:
   Yet you haven't returned to me," says Yahweh.

                    <p>
                        I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, "Strike
the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break them
in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them
with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall
not one of them escape.

                        Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand
will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring
them down.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I
will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my
sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and
it will bite them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Though they go into captivity before their
enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will
set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.

                        For the Lord,
Yahweh of Hosts, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who
dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and
will sink again, like the River of Egypt.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        It is he who builds his
chambers in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who
calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of
the earth; Yahweh is his name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Are you not like the children of
the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?" says Yahweh. "Haven't I
brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from
Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Behold, the eyes of the Lord
Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the
surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house
of Jacob," says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        "For, behold, I will command, and I will
sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a
sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        All the
sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, 'Evil won't
overtake nor meet us.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        In that day I will raise up the tent of
David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its
ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        that they may
possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my
name," says Yahweh who does this.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        "Behold, the days come," says Yahweh,
   "That the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
   And the one treading grapes him who sows seed;
   And sweet wine will drip from the mountains,
   And flow from the hills.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel,
   And they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them;
   and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them.
They shall also make gardens,
   And eat the fruit of them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        I will plant them on their land,
   And they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have
      given them,"
   says Yahweh your God.
