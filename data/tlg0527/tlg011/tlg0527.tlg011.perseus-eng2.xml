<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="2"><p>and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="3"><p>This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Hosts in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="4"><p>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="5"><p>but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="6"><p>Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="8"><p>Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why don’t you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better to you than ten sons?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="9"><p>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="10"><p>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept sore.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="11"><p>She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="12"><p>It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli marked her mouth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="14"><p>Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="15"><p>Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="16"><p>Don’t count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="17"><p>Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="18"><p>She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="21"><p>The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="22"><p>But Hannah didn’t go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="23"><p>Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word. So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="24"><p>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the child was young.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg011.perseus-eng2:1" n="25"><p>They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.</p></div>
