                    <p>
                        Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
him with clothes, but he got no heat.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Therefore his servants said
to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and
let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your
bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found
Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to
him; but the king didn't know her intimately.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Then Adonijah the
son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared
him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done
so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the
priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But Zadok the
priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and
Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not
with Adonijah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the
stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his
brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's
servants:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty
men, and Solomon his brother, he didn't call.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Then Nathan spoke
to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Haven't you heard that
Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn't know it?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may
save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Go and get
you in to king David, and tell him, Didn't you, my lord, king, swear to
your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me,
and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in
after you, and confirm your words.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Bathsheba went in to the king
into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite
was ministering to the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance
to the king. The king said, What would you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        She said to him, My
lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid, [saying],
Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my
throne.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king,
don't know it:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in
abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the
priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but he hasn't called Solomon
your servant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are
on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my
lord the king after him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Otherwise it will happen, when my lord
the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall
be counted offenders.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Behold, while she yet talked with the
king, Nathan the prophet came in.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        They told the king, saying,
Behold, Nathan the prophet. When he was come in before the king, he
bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Nathan said, My lord, king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after
me, and he shall sit on my throne?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        For he is gone down this day,
and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called
all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the
priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say,
[Long] live king Adonijah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        But he hasn't called me, even me your
servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
your servant Solomon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Is this thing done by my lord the king,
and you haven't shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of
my lord the king after him?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Then king David answered, Call to me
Bathsheba. She came into the king's presence, and stood before the
king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        The king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has
redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        most assuredly as I swore
to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son
shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place; most
assuredly so will I do this day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Then Bathsheba bowed with her
face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord
king David live forever.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        King David said, Call to me Zadok the
priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. They
came before the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        The king said to them, Take with you the
servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule,
and bring him down to Gihon:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        and let Zadok the priest and Nathan
the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow you the
trumpet, and say, [Long] live king Solomon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Then you shall come
up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be
king in my place; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and
over Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and
said, Amen: Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, say so [too].
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon,
and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and
caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and
anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said,
[Long] live king Solomon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        All the people came up after him, and
the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the
earth shook with the sound of them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        Adonijah and all the guests
who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab
heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city
being in an uproar?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/>
                        While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son
of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a
worthy man, and bring good news.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="43"/>
                        Jonathan answered Adonijah,
Most assuredly our lord king David has made Solomon king:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="44"/>
                        and
the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the
Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in
Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang
again. This is the noise that you have heard.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        Also Solomon sits
on the throne of the kingdom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        Moreover the king's servants came
to bless our lord king David, saying, Your God make the name of Solomon
better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne:
and the king bowed himself on the bed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="48"/>
                        Also thus said the king,
Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my
throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="49"/>
                        All the guests of
Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="50"/>
                        Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught
hold on the horns of the altar.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        It was told Solomon, saying,
Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he has laid hold on
the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that
he will not kill his servant with the sword.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="52"/>
                        Solomon said, If he
shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to
the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="53"/>
                        So
king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came
and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your
house.
                    </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">

                    <p>
                        Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he
charged Solomon his son, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        I am going the way of all the
earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        and keep
the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his
statutes, [and] his commandments, and his ordinances, and his
testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses,
that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn
yourself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke
concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk
before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there
shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even
what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the
son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed
the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that
was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Do

                        There were beams in three rows, and window was

                        All the doors and posts were
made square with beams: and window was over against window in three

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He made the porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty
cubits, and the breadth of it thirty cubits; and a porch before them;
and pillars and a threshold before them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        He made the porch of the
throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was
covered with cedar from floor to floor.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        His house where he was to
dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made
also a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife),
like this porch.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        All these were of costly stones, even of hewn
stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even
from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great
court.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Above were
costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        The great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and
a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of
Yahweh, and the porch of the house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        King Solomon sent and
fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        He was the son of a widow of the
tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass;
and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all
works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high
apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the
pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height
of the other capital was five cubits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        There were nets of
checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were on
the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the
other capital.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        So he made the pillars; and there were two rows
round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the
top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        The
capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of
lily-work, four cubits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        There were capitals above also on the
two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the
pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about on the other
capital.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and
he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin; and he
set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        On the
top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars
finished.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to
brim, round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits; and a
line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Under the brim
of it round about there were buds which did compass it, for ten cubits,
compassing the sea round about: the buds were in two rows, cast when it
was cast.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the
north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them
above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        It was a
handbreadth thick: and the brim of it was worked like the brim of a
cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        He
made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base,
and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the height of it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        The work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and
there were panels between the ledges;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        and on the panels that
were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the
ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were
wreaths of hanging work.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Every base had four brazen wheels, and
axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin
were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        The
mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth of
it was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also
on the mouth of it were engravings, and their panels were foursquare,
not round.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the
axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a
cubit and half a cubit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        The work of the wheels was like the work
of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and
their naves, were all molten.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        There were four supports at the
four corners of each base: the supports of it were of the base itself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit
high; and on the top of the base the stays of it and the panels of it
were of the same.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        On the plates of the stays of it, and on the
panels of it, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to
the space of each, with wreaths round about.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        After this manner
he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and
one form.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        He made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty
baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on very one of the ten
bases one basin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        He set the bases, five on the right side of the
house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on
the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        Hiram
made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end
of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of
Yahweh:

                        the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that

                        and
the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of

that were on the pillars;

                        and the ten bases, and the ten basins
on the bases;

                        and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the

                        and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all
these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of
Yahweh, were of burnished brass.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        In the plain of the Jordan did
the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were
exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="48"/>
                        Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh: the
golden altar, and the table whereupon the show bread was, of gold;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="49"/>
                        and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the
left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps,
and the tongs, of gold;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="50"/>
                        and the cups, and the snuffers, and the
basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the
hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and
for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was
finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had
dedicated, [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put
them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh.

                        They

                        King Solomon and all the congregation of

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of

                        For the cherubim
spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim

                        The poles were so long

                        There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which

                        There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the

there was no breath left in him.

                        It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came to
Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I
will send rain on the earth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Elijah went to show himself to
Ahab. The famine was sore in Samaria.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Ahab called Obadiah, who
was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        for
it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah
took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed
them with bread and water.)
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the

we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose
all the animals.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        So they divided the land between them to pass
throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another
way by himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met
him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you, my

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        He answered him, It is I: go, tell your lord,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        He said, Wherein have I sinned, that

                        As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where
my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not here,
he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn't find you.

                        Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].

                        It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit
of Yahweh will carry you I don't know where; and so when I come and
tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will kill me: but I your servant

                        Wasn't it told my lord what I did
when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men
of Yahweh's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is

                        Elijah said, As Yahweh of Hosts

                        So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to

                        It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said

                        He answered, I have

                        Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount

                        So
Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets
together to Mount Carmel.

                        Elijah came near to all the people,
and said, How long go you limping between the two sides? if Yahweh is
God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. The people answered him
not a word.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, am
left a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty
men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose
one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood,
and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on
the wood, and put no fire under.

                        Call you on the name of your

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bull for
yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name
of your god, but put no fire under.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        They took the bull which
was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal
from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no
voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was
made.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,
Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside,
or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleeps and must be awakened.

                        They cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with

                        It was
so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the
offering of the [evening] offering; but there was neither voice, nor
any to answer, nor any who regarded.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Elijah said to all the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Elijah took

                        With the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh;
and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in
pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, Fill four jars with water,
and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        He said, Do

                        The water ran round
about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        It
happened at the time of the offering of the [evening] offering, that
Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of
Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in
Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these

                        Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people
may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and [that] you have turned their

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed
the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and
licked up the water that was in the trench.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        When all the people

                        and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets

                        Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is the sound

                        So Ahab went up to eat and to drink.
Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the

                        He said to his

Thus speaks Ben Hadad, saying, I sent indeed to you, saying, You shall

                        Then the king of

                        The king of Israel answered, Tell him, Don't let him who girds on [his

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        It happened, when
[Ben Hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings,

escaped on a horse with horsemen.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        The king of Israel went out,

                        The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and

                        The servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god

                        It happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered
the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.

                        The

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        A
man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus
says Yahweh, Because the Syrians have said, Yahweh is a god of the
hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all
this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am
Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        They encamped one over against the other seven days. So
it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children
of Israel killed of the Syrians one hundred thousand footmen in one
day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall
fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and
came into the city, into an inner chamber.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        His servants said to

will save your life.

                        So they girded sackcloth on their loins,
and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and
said, Your servant Ben Hadad says, please let me live. He said, Is he
yet alive? he is my brother.

                        Now the men observed diligently,
and hurried to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Your

forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.

                        [Ben Hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took from your

                        A

                        Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh,
behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall kill you. As
soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        Then he found another man, and said, Please strike me. The man

                        So the prophet departed,

                        As the king passed by, he cried to the

Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your life be

said to his servants, "You know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are
still, and don't take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        He said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?
Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as
your people, my horses as your horses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Jehoshaphat said to the
king of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four
hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to
battle, or shall I forbear? They said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver
it into the hand of the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there
here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we
may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he
does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. Jehoshaphat said,
"Don't let the king say so."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then the king of Israel called an
officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now
the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each
on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance
of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before
them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and
said, Thus says Yahweh, With these shall you push the Syrians, until
they be consumed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up
to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand
of the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to
him, saying, See now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the
king with one mouth: please let your word be like the word of one of
them, and speak you good.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what
Yahweh says to me, that will I speak.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        When he was come to the
king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to
battle, or shall we forbear? He answered him, Go up and prosper; and
Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        The king said
to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing
but the truth in the name of Yahweh?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        He said, I saw all Israel
scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh
said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in
peace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell
you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        [Micaiah] said, Therefore hear you the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh
sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on
his right hand and on his left.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Yahweh said, Who shall entice
Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? One said on this
manner; and another said on that manner.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        There came forth a
spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, I will entice him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Yahweh said to him, 'How?' He said, 'I will go forth, and will be a
lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' He said, 'You shall
entice him, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Now
therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all
these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the
cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak
to you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when
you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        The king
of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor
of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        and say, Thus says
the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of
affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by
me. He said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        So the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
and go into the battle; but put you on your robes. The king of Israel
disguised himself, and went into the battle.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Now the king of
Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying,
Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside
to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        It happened,
when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of
Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        A certain man
drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the
joints of the armor: therefore he said to the driver of his chariot,
Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am severely
wounded.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        The battle increased that day: and the king was stayed
up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood
ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        There went
a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying,
Every man to his city, and every man to his country.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        So the
king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in
Samaria.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and
the dogs licked up his blood (now the prostitutes washed themselves
[there]); according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        Now
the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house
which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren't they written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        So Ahab
slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the

                        Jehoshaphat was thirty-five
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in
Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="43"/>
                        He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn't turn aside from
it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: however the high
places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt
incense in the high places.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="44"/>
                        Jehoshaphat made peace with the
king of Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and
his might that he shown, and how he warred, aren't they written in the

                        The remnant of
the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        There was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

                        Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but
they didn't go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="49"/>
                        Then
said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with
your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="50"/>
                        Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David his father; Jehoram his son reigned in his place.

                        Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned
two years over Israel.

                        He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his
mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made
Israel to sin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="53"/>
                        He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked
