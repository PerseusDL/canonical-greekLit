                        priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
                            <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/> These things shall be for a statute

                        shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify
                        against any person that he die. <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/> Moreover
                        you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death;
                        but he shall surely be put to death. <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/> You
                        shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may
                        come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. <milestone
                            unit="verse" n="33"/> So you shall not pollute the land in which you
                        are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the
                        land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him who shed
                        it. <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/> You shall not defile the land which you
                        inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Yahweh, dwell in the midst of
                        the children of Israel. </p>

                        for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of
