                    <p>
                        The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the
days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the
days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        When Yahweh
spoke at the first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, "Go, take for
yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the
land commits great adultery against from Yahweh."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she
conceived, and bore him a son.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Yahweh said to him, "Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little
while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and
will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        It will
happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of
Jezreel."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        She conceived again, and bore a daughter.

   Then he said to him, "Call her name Lo-Ruhamah; for I will no longer
have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon
them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save
them by Yahweh their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword,
nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a
son.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        He said, "Call his name Lo-Ammi; for you are not my people,
and I will not be yours.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Yet the number of the children of
Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can't be measured nor
numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said
to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the
living God.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        The children of Judah and the children of Israel
will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head,
and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel.

                    <p>
                        "Say to your brothers, 'My people!'
   And to your sisters, 'My loved one!'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Contend with your mother!
   Contend, for she is not my wife,
   Neither am I her husband;
And let her put away her prostitution from her face,
   And her adulteries from between her breasts;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Lest I strip her naked,
   And make her bare as in the day that she was born,
And make her like a wilderness,
   And set her like a dry land,
   And kill her with thirst.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;
   For they are children of unfaithfulness;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For their mother has played the prostitute.
   She who conceived them has done shamefully;
For she said, 'I will go after my lovers,
   Who give me my bread and my water,
   My wool and my flax,
   My oil and my drink.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns,
   And I will build a wall against her,
   That she can't find her way.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        She will follow after her lovers,
   But she won't overtake them;
And she will seek them,
   But won't find them.
Then she will say, 'I will go and return to my first husband;
   For then was it better with me than now.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and
      the oil,
   And multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,
   And my new wine in its season,
   And will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered
      her nakedness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
   And no one will deliver her out of my hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:
   Her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn
      assemblies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
   About which she has said, 'These are my wages that my lovers have
      given me;
   And I will make them a forest,'
   And the animals of the field shall eat them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        I will visit on her the days of the Baals,
   To which she burned incense,
When she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,
   And went after her lovers,
   And forgot me," says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        "Therefore, behold, I will allure her,
   And bring her into the wilderness,
   And speak tenderly to her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        I will give her vineyards from there,
   And the valley of Achor for a door of hope;
And she will respond there,
   As in the days of her youth,
   And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        It will be in that day," says Yahweh,
   "That you will call me 'my husband,'
   And no longer call me 'my master.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,
   And they will no more be mentioned by their name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of
      the field,
   And with the birds of the sky,
   And with the creeping things of the ground.
I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,
   And will make them lie down safely.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        I will betroth you to me forever.
   Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in
      lovingkindness, and in compassion.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;
   And you shall know Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        It will happen in that day, I will respond," says Yahweh,
   I will respond to the heavens,
   And they will respond to the earth;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        And the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine,
      and the oil;
   And they will respond to Jezreel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        I will sow her to me in the earth;
   And I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;
   And I will tell those who were not my people, 'You are my people;'
   And they will say, 'My God!'"

                    <p>
                        Yahweh said to me, "Go again, love a woman loved by another,
and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though
they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a
homer and a half of barley.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        I said to her, "You shall stay with
me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be
with any other man. I will also be so toward you."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king,
and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without sacred stone,
and without ephod or idols.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Afterward the children of Israel
shall return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and
shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last
days.

                    <p>
                        Hear the word of Yahweh, you children of Israel;
   For Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:
"Indeed there is no truth,
   Nor goodness,
   Nor knowledge of God in the land.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing
      adultery;
   They break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Therefore the land will mourn,
   And everyone who dwells therein will waste away.
All living things in her,
   Even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;
   Yes, the fish of the sea also die.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        "Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For
      your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        You will stumble in the day,
   And the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;
   And I will destroy your mother.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
   Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,
   That you may be no priest to me.
Because you have your God's law,
   I will also forget your children.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.
   I will change their glory into shame.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        They feed on the sin of my people,
   And set their heart on their iniquity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        It will be, like people, like priest;
   And I will punish them for their ways,
   And will repay them for their deeds.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        They will eat, and not have enough.
   They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;
   Because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        My people consult with their wooded idol,
   And answer to a stick of wood.
Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,
   And they have been unfaithful to their God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,
   And burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
   Because its shade is good.
Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,
   And your brides commit adultery.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,
   Nor your brides when they commit adultery;
Because the men consort with prostitutes,
   And they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;
   And the people that does not understand will come to ruin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        "Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,
   Yet don't let Judah offend;
   And don't come to Gilgal,
   Neither go up to Beth Aven,
   Nor swear, 'As Yahweh lives.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn
      heifer.
   Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
