                    <p>
                        The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord Yahweh says about
Edom. We have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among
the nations, saying, "Arise, and let's rise up against her in battle.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Behold, I have made you small among the nations. You are greatly
despised.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell
in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who says in his
heart, 'Who will bring me down to the ground?'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Though you mount
on high as the eagle, and though your nest is set among the stars, I
will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        If thieves came to
you, if robbers by night -- oh, what disaster awaits you -- wouldn't
they only steal until they had enough? If grape pickers came to you,
wouldn't they leave some gleaning grapes?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        How Esau will be
ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        All the men
of your alliance have brought you on your way, even to the border. The
men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against
you. Friends who eat your bread lay a snare under you. There is no
understanding in him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        "Won't I in that day," says Yahweh, "destroy the wise men out
of Edom, and understanding out of the mountain of Esau?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Your
mighty men, Teman, will be dismayed, to the end that everyone may be
cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For the violence
done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut
off forever.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        In the day that you stood on the other side, in the
day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered
into his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were like one of
them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But don't look down on your brother in the day of his
disaster, and don't rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of
their destruction. Don't speak proudly in the day of distress.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Don't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity.
Don't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity,
neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Don't
stand in the crossroads to cut off those of his who escape. Don't
deliver up those of his who remain in the day of distress.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For
the day of Yahweh is near all the nations! As you have done, it will be
done to you. Your deeds will return upon your own head.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For as
you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink
continually. Yes, they will drink, swallow down, and will be as though
they had not been.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        But in Mount Zion, there will be those who
escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob will possess their
possessions.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of
Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. They will burn among
them, and devour them. There will not be any remaining to the house of
Esau." Indeed, Yahweh has spoken.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau, and
those of the lowland, the Philistines. They will possess the field of
Ephraim, and the field of Samaria. Benjamin will possess Gilead.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        The captives of this host of the children of Israel, who are among the
Canaanites, will possess even to Zarephath; and the captives of
Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will possess the cities of the Negev.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Saviors will go up on Mount Zion to judge the mountains of Esau,
and the kingdom will be Yahweh's.
