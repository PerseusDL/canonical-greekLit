<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg056.perseus-eng2:1" n="5"><p>The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end of it they should stand before the king. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg056.perseus-eng2:1" n="6"><p>Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg056.perseus-eng2:1" n="8"><p>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg056.perseus-eng2:1" n="9"><p>Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg056.perseus-eng2:1" n="10"><p>The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? so would you endanger my head with the king. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg056.perseus-eng2:1" n="11"><p>Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: </p></div>
