 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they
said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back
for all of the evil which we did to him.

"So will you tell Joseph, 'Now please forgive the disobedience of your
brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.' Now, please
forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father."
Joseph wept when they spoke to him.

 As for you, you meant evil against me, but
God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save

 Joseph lived in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, he, and his father's house. Joseph

 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am
