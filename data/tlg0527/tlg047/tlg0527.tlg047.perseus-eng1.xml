                    <p>
                        An oracle: the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        "I have loved you," says Yahweh.

   Yet you say, "How have you loved us?"

   "Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?" says Yahweh, "Yet I loved Jacob;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave
his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Whereas Edom
says, "We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste
places;" thus says Yahweh of Hosts, "They shall build, but I will throw
down; and men will call them 'The Wicked Land,' even the people against
whom Yahweh shows wrath forever."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Your eyes will see, and you will say, "Yahweh is great -- even
beyond the border of Israel!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        "A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a
father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the
respect due me? Says Yahweh of Hosts to you, priests, who despise my
name. You say, 'How have we despised your name?'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        You offer
polluted bread on my altar. You say, 'How have we polluted you?' In
that you say, 'Yahweh's table contemptible.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        When you offer the
blind for sacrifice, isn't that evil? And when you offer the lame and
sick, isn't that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be
pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?" says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        "Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious
to us. With this, will he accept any of you?" says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        "Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors,
that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure
in you," says Yahweh of hosts, "neither will I accept an offering at
your hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For from the rising of the sun even to the going down
of the same my name is be great among the nations, and in every place
incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is
great among the nations," says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        "But you profane
it, in that you say, 'Yahweh's table is polluted, and its fruit, even
its food, is contemptible.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        You say also, 'Behold, what a
weariness it is!' and you have sniffed at it," says Yahweh of Hosts;
"and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and
the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your
hand?" says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        "But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and
vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great
King," says Yahweh of hosts, "and my name is awesome among the nations."

                    <p>
                        "Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        If you
will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to
my name," says Yahweh of Hosts, "then will I send the curse on you, and
I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already,
because you do not lay it to heart.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Behold, I will rebuke your
seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts;
and you will be taken away with it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        You will know that I have
sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi," says
Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        "My covenant was with him of life and peace; and
I gave them to him who he might be reverent toward me; and he was
reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The law of truth
was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He
walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from
iniquity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they
should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of
Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But you have turned aside out of the way. You have caused
many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,"
says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        "Therefore I have also made you
contemptible and base before all the people, according to the way you
have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Don't we all have one father? Hasn't one God created us? Why do
we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the
covenant of our fathers?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Judah has dealt treacherously, and an
abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has
profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the
daughter of a foreign god.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Yahweh will cut off, to the man who
does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of
Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        This
again you do: you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping,
and with sighing, because he doesn't regard the offering any more,
neither receives it with good will at your hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Yet you say,
'Why?' Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your
youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your
companion, and the wife of your covenant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Did he not make one,
although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought a godly
seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal
treacherously against the wife of his youth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For I hate
divorce," says Yahweh, the God of Israel, "and him who covers his
garment with violence!' says Yahweh of Hosts. "Therefore take heed to
your spirit, that you don't deal treacherously.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        You have wearied
Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, 'How have we wearied him?' In that
you say, 'Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he
delights in them;' or 'Where is the God of justice?'

                    <p>
                        "Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way
before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his
temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he
comes!" says Yahweh of hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        "But who can endure the day of his
coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's
fire, and like launderer's soap;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        and he will sit as a refiner and
purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine
them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in
righteousness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be
pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against
the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages,
the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive the foreigner of
justice, and don't fear me," says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        "For I,
Yahweh, don't change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my
ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to
you," says Yahweh of Hosts. "But you say, 'How shall we return?'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, 'How have we robbed
you?' In tithes and offerings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        You are cursed with the curse; for
you rob me, even this whole nation.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Bring the whole tithe into
the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in
this," says Yahweh of hosts, "if I will not open you the windows of
heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
enough for.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he
shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine
cast its fruit before its time in the field," says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        "All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a
delightful land," says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        "Your words have been stout against me," says Yahweh. "Yet
you say, 'What have we spoken against you?'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        You have said, 'It
is vain to serve God;' and 'What profit is it that we have kept his
charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Hosts?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are
built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Then those who
feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard,
and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared
Yahweh, and who honored his name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        They shall be mine," says
Yahweh of Hosts, "my own possession in the day that I make, and I will
spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Then you
shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between
him who serves God and him who doesn't serve him.

the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day
that comes will burn them up," says Yahweh of Hosts, "that it shall
leave them neither root nor branch.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        But to you who fear my name
shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You

down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in

fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their
fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse."
