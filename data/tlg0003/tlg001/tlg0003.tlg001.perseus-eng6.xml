<p rend="align(indent)">Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the moment that it broke out, and believing that it would be a great war, and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it. This belief was not without its grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every department in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed doing so at once having it in contemplation.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.1" n="2"> 
<p>Indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in history, not only of the Hellenes, but of a large part of the barbarian world—I had almost said of mankind.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.1" n="3"> 
<p>For though the events of remote antiquity, and even those that more immediately precede the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that there was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters. </p> </div> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">For instance, it is evident that the country now called <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> had in ancient times no settled population; on the contrary, migrations were of frequent occurrence, the several tribes readily abandoning their homes under the pressure of superior numbers.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.2" n="2"> 
<p>Without commerce, without freedom of communication either by land or sea, cultivating no more of their territory than the exigencies of life required, destitute of capital, never planting their land (for they could not tell when an invader might not come and take it all away, and when he did come they had no walls to stop him), thinking that the necessities of daily sustenance could be supplied at one place as well as another, they cared little for shifting their habitation, and consequently neither built large cities nor attained to any other form of greatness.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.2" n="3"> 
<p>The richest soils were always most subject to this change of masters; such as the district now called <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, most of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> excepted, and the most fertile parts of the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.2" n="4"> 
<p>The goodness of the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular individuals, and thus created faction which proved a fertile source of ruin. It also invited invasion.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.2" n="5"> 
<p>Accordingly <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, from the poverty of its soil enjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction, never changed its inhabitants.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.2" n="6"> 
<p>And here is no inconsiderable exemplification of my assertion, that the migrations were the cause of there being no correspondent growth in other parts. The most powerful victims of war or faction from the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> took refuge with the Athenians as a safe retreat; and at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the already large population of the city to such a height that <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> became at last too small to hold them, and they had to send out colonies to <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>. </p> </div> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.3" n="1"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">There is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my conviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the Trojan war there is no indication of any common action in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>,</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.3" n="2"> 
<p>nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of Hellen, son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the country went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the Pelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in <placeName key="tgn,7002684">Phthiotis</placeName>, and were invited as allies into the other cities, that one by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.3" n="3"> 
<p>The best proof of this is furnished by Homer. Born long after the Trojan war, he nowhere calls all of them by that name, nor indeed any of them except the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis, who were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called Danaans, Argives, and Achaeans. He does not even use the term barbarian, probably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one distinctive appellation.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.3" n="4"> 
<p>It appears therefore that the several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first acquired the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other, but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people, were before the Trojan war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective action.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Indeed, they could not unite for this expedition till they had gained increased familiarity with the sea. </p> </div> </div>

<p>And the first person known to us by tradition as having established a navy is Minos. He made himself master of what is now called the Hellenic sea, and ruled over the <placeName key="tgn,7011270">Cyclades</placeName>, into most of which he sent the first colonies, expelling the Carians and appointing his own sons governors; and thus did his best to put down piracy in those waters, a necessary step to secure the revenues for his own use. </p> </div> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">For in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and islands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to turn pirates, under the conduct of their most powerful men; the motives being to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy. They would fall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere collection of villages, and would plunder it; indeed, this came to be the main source of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to such an achievement, but even some glory.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.5" n="2"> 
<p>An illustration of this is furnished by the honor with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder, and by the question we find the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking of voyagers—‘Are they pirates?’—as if those who are asked the question would have no idea of disclaiming the imputation, or their interrogators of reproaching them for it.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.5" n="3"> 
<p>The same rapine prevailed also by land.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And even at the present day many parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> still follow the old fashion, the Ozolian Locrians, for instance, the Aetolians, the Acarnanians, and that region of the continent; and the custom of carrying arms is still kept up among these continentals, from the old piratical habits. </p> </div> </div>

<p>The whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> used once to carry arms, their habitations being unprotected, and their communication with each other unsafe; indeed, to wear arms was as much a part of everyday life with them as with the barbarians.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.6" n="2"> 
<p>And the fact that the people in these parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> are still living in the old way points to a time when the same mode of life was once equally common to all.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.6" n="3"> 
<p>The Athenians were the first to lay aside their weapons, and to adopt an easier and more luxurious mode of life; indeed, it is only lately that their rich old men left off the luxury of wearing undergarments of linen, and fastening a knot of their hair with a tie of golden grasshoppers, a fashion which spread to their Ionian kindred, and long prevailed among the old men there.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.6" n="4"> 
<p>On the contrary a modest style of dressing, more in conformity with modern ideas, was first adopted by the Lacedaemonians, the rich doing their best to assimilate their way of life to that of the common people.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:1.6" n="5"> 
<p>They also set the example of contending naked, publicly stripping and anointing themselves with oil in their gymnastic exercises. Formerly, even in the Olympic contests, the athletes who contended wore belts across their middles; and it is but a few years since that the practice ceased. To this day among some of the barbarians, especially in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, when prizes for boxing and wrestling are offered, belts are worn by the combatants.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">With respect to their towns, later on, at an era of increased facilities of navigation and a greater supply of capital, we find the shores becoming the site of walled towns, and the isthmuses being occupied for the purposes of commerce, and defence against a neighbor. But the old towns, on account of the great prevalence of piracy, were built away from the sea, whether on the islands or the continent, and still remain in their old sites.

<p rend="align(indent)">The islanders, too, were great pirates. These islanders were Carians and Phoenicians, by whom most of the islands were colonized, as was proved by the following fact. During the purification of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> by <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in this war all the graves in the island were taken up, and it was found that above half their inmates were Carians: they were identified by the fashion of the arms buried with them, and by the method of interment, which was the same as the Carians still follow.</p> </div>

<p>The coast populations now began to apply themselves more closely to the acquisition of wealth, and their life became more settled; some even began to build themselves walls on the strength of their newly-acquired riches.

<p>Indeed, the account given by those Peloponnesians who have been the recipients of the most credible tradition is this. First of all Pelops, arriving among a needy population from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> with vast wealth, acquired such power that, stranger though he was, the country was called after him; and this power fortune saw fit materially to increase in the hands of his descendants. Eurystheus had been killed in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> by the Heraclids. Atreus was his mother's brother; and to the hands of his relation, who had left his father on account of the death of Chrysippus, Eurystheus, when he set out on his expedition, had committed <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> and the government. As time went on and Eurystheus did not return, Atreus complied with the wishes of the Mycenaeans, who were influenced by fear of the Heraclids,—besides, his power seemed considerable, and he had not neglected to court the favour of the populace,—and assumed the sceptre of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> and the rest of the dominions of Eurystheus.

<p>For ourselves, all who have already had dealings with the Athenians require no warning to be on their guard against them. The states more inland and out of the highway of communication should understand that if they omit to support the coast powers, the result will be to injure the transit of their produce for exportation and the reception in exchange of their imports from the sea; and they must not be careless judges of what is now said, as if it had nothing to do with them, but must expect that the sacrifice of the powers on the coast will one day be followed by the extension of the danger to the interior, and must recognize that their own interests are deeply involved in this discussion.</p> </div>

<p>For these reasons they should not hesitate to exchange peace for war.

Alarmed by the reflection that none of the previous messengers had ever returned, having counterfeited the seal, in order that, if he found himself mistaken in his surmises, or if Pausanias should ask to make some correction, he might not be discovered, he undid the letter, and found the postscript that he had suspected, viz., an order to put him to death. </p> </div> </div>

Accordingly the man went by appointment to Taenarus as a suppliant, and there built himself a hut divided into two by a partition; within which he concealed some of the Ephors and let them hear the whole matter plainly. For Pausanias came to him and asked him the reason of his suppliant position; and the man reproached him with the order that he had written concerning him, and one by one declared all the rest of the circumstances, how he who had never yet brought him into any danger, while employed as agent between him and the king, was yet just like the mass of his servants, to be rewarded with death. Admitting all this, and telling him not to be angry about the matter, Pausanias gave him the pledge of raising him up from the temple, and begged him to set off as quickly as possible, and not to hinder the business in hand. </p> </div> </div>

It is reported that, as he was about to be arrested in the street, he saw from the face of one of the Ephors what he was coming for; another, too, made him a secret signal, and betrayed it to him from kindness. Setting off with a run for the temple of the goddess of the Brazen House, the enclosure of which was near at hand, he succeeded in taking sanctuary before they took him, and entering into a small chamber, which formed part of the temple, to avoid being exposed to the weather, lay still there.</p> </div>

This he might do, either from a personal wish to oblige him, or acting under instructions from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> for the purpose of creating a prejudice against him, as had been before attempted in the demand for the expulsion of the accursed family. He accordingly took the precaution of announcing to the Athenians in the assembly that, although Archidamus was his friend, yet this friendship should not extend to the detriment of the state, and that in case the enemy should make his houses and lands an exception to the rest and not pillage them, he at once gave them up to be public property, so that they should not bring him into suspicion.</p> </div>

They were not to go out to battle, but to come into the city and guard it, and get ready their fleet, in which their real strength lay. They were also to keep a tight rein on their allies—the strength of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> being derived from the money brought in by their payments, and success in war depending principally upon conduct and capital.</p> </div>

<p>Here they had no reason to despond. Apart from other sources of income, an average revenue of six hundred talents of silver was drawn from the tribute of the allies; and there were still six thousand talents of coined silver in the Acropolis, out of nine thousand seven hundred that had once been there, from which the money had been taken for the porch of the Acropolis, the other public buildings, and for <placeName key="perseus,Potidaia">Potidaea</placeName>.</p> </div>

Under Cecrops and the first kings, down to the reign of Theseus, <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> had always consisted of a number of independent townships, each with its own town-hall and magistrates. Except in times of danger the king at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was not consulted; in ordinary seasons they carried on their government and settled their affairs without his interference; sometimes even they waged war against him, as in the case of the Eleusinians with Eumolpus against Erechtheus.</p> </div>

<p>In Theseus, however, they had a king of equal intelligence and power; and one of the chief features in his organization of the country was to abolish the council chambers and magistrates of the petty cities, and to merge them in the single council-chamber and town-hall of the present capital. Individuals might still enjoy their private property just as before, but they were henceforth compelled to have only one political center, viz.  <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; which thus counted all the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> among her citizens, so that when Theseus died he left a great state behind him. Indeed, from him dates the Synoecia, or Feast of Union; which is paid for by the state, and which the Athenians still keep in honor of the goddess.</p> </div>

<p>This is shown by the fact that the temples the other deities, besides that of Athena, are in the citadel; and even those that are outside it are mostly situated in this quarter of the city, as that of the Olympian Zeus, of the Pythian Apollo, of Earth, and of Dionysus in the Marshes, the same in whose honor the older Dionysia are to this day celebrated in the month of Anthesterion not only by the Athenians but also by their Ionian descendants.</p> </div>

The fountain too, which, since the alteration made by the tyrants, has been called Enneacrounos, or Nine Pipes, but which, when the spring was open, went by the name of Callirhoe, or Fairwater, was in those days, from being so near, used for the most important offices.

The occupation of the plot of ground lying below the citadel called the Pelasgian had been forbidden by a curse; and there was also an ominous fragment of a Pythian oracle which said—</p> <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/> <quote type="oracle"> <l met="dact"> Leave the Pelasgian parcel desolate, woe worth the day that men inhabit it! </l> </quote> </div>

<p>‘Archidamus and Lacedaemonians, in invading the Plataean territory, you do what is wrong in itself, and worthy neither of yourselves nor of the fathers who begot you. Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, your countryman, after freeing <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> from the Medes with the help of those Hellenes who were willing to undertake the risk of the battle fought near our city, offered sacrifice to Zeus the Liberator in the market-place of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, and calling all the allies together restored to the Plataeans their city and territory, and declared it independent and inviolate against aggression or conquest.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.71" n="4"> 
<p>We appeal, therefore, to the gods to whom the oaths were then made, to the gods of your ancestors, and lastly to those of our country, and call upon you to refrain from violating our territory or transgressing the oaths, and to let us live independent, as Pausanias decreed.’</p> </div> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">The Plataeans had got thus far when they were cut short by Archidamus saying, ‘There is justice, Plataeans, in what you say, if you act up to your words. According to the grant of Pausanias, continue to be independent yourselves, and join in freeing those of your fellow-countrymen who, after sharing in the perils of that period, joined in the oaths to you, and are now subject to the Athenians; for it is to free them and the rest that all this provision and war has been made. I could wish that you would share our labors and abide by the oaths yourselves; if this is impossible, do what we have already required of you—remain neutral, enjoying your own; join neither side, but receive both as friends, neither as allies for the war.

The Plataeans, after hearing what he had to say, went into the city and acquainted the people with what had passed, and presently returned for answer that it was impossible for them to do what he proposed without consulting the Athenians, with whom their children and wives now were; besides which they had their fears for the town. After his departure, what was to prevent the Athenians from coming and taking it out of their hands, or the Thebans, who would be included in the oaths, from taking advantage of the proposed neutrality to make a second attempt to seize the city?</p> </div>

<p>Upon these points he tried to reassure them by saying: ‘You have only to deliver over the city and houses to us Lacedaemonians, to point out the boundaries of your land, the number of your fruit-trees, and whatever else can be numerically stated, and yourselves to withdraw wherever you like as long as the war shall last. When it is over we will restore to you whatever we received, and in the interim hold it in trust and keep it in cultivation, paying you a sufficient allowance.’</p> </div> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.74" n="2"> 
<p>As soon as be had received this answer, King Archidamus proceeded first to make a solemn appeal to the gods and heroes of the country in words following:—‘Ye gods and heroes of the Plataean territory, be my witnesses that not as aggressors originally, nor until these had first departed from the common oath, did we invade this land, in which our fathers offered you their prayers before defeating the Medes, and which you made auspicious to the Hellenic arms; nor shall we be aggressors in the measures to which we may now resort, since we have made many fair proposals but have not been successful. Graciously accord that those who were the first to offend may be punished for it, and that vengeance may be attained by those who would righteously inflict it.’</p> </div> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">After this appeal to the gods Archidamus put his army in motion. First he enclosed the town with a palisade formed of the fruit-trees which they cut down, to prevent further egress from <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>; next day they threw up a mound against the city, hoping that the largeness of the force employed would insure the speedy reduction of the place.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.75" n="2"> 
<p>They accordingly cut down timber from Cithaeron, and built it up on either side, laying it like lattice-work to serve as a wall to keep the mound from spreading abroad, and carried to it wood and stones and earth and whatever other material might help to complete it.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.75" n="3"> 
<p>They continued to work at the mound for seventy days and nights without intermission, being divided into relief parties to allow of some being employed in carrying while others took sleep and refreshment; the Lacedaemonian officer attached to each contingent keeping the men to the work.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.75" n="4"> 
<p>But the Plataeans observing the progress of the mound, constructed a wall of wood and fixed it upon that part of the city wall against which the mound was being erected, and built up bricks inside it which they took from the neighboring houses.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.75" n="5"> 
<p>The timbers served to bind the building together, and to prevent its becoming weak as it advanced in height; it had also a covering of skins and hides, which protected the wood-work against the attacks of burning missiles and allowed the men to work in safety.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.75" n="6"> 
<p>Thus the wall was raised to a great height, and the mound opposite made no less rapid progress. The Plataeans also thought of another expedient; they pulled out part of the wall upon which the mound abutted, and carried the earth into the city. </p> </div> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter"  xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2" n="76">

<p rend="align(indent)">Discovering this the Peloponnesians twisted up clay in wattles of reed and threw it into the breach formed in the mound, in order to give it consistency and prevent its being carried away like the soil.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.76" n="2"> 
<p>Stopped in this way the Plataeans changed their mode of operation, and digging a mine from the town calculated their way under the mound, and began to carry off its material as before. This went on for a long while without the enemy outside finding it out, so that for all they threw on the top their mound made no progress in proportion, being carried away from beneath and constantly settling down in the vacuum.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.76" n="3"> 
<p>But the Plataeans fearing that even thus they might not be able to hold out against the superior numbers of the enemy, had yet another invention. They stopped working at the large building in front of the mound, and starting at either end of it inside from the old low wall, built a new one in the form of a crescent running in towards the town in order that in the event of the great wall being taken this might remain, and the enemy have to throw up a fresh mound against it, and as they advanced within might not only have their trouble over again, but also be exposed to missiles on their flanks.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.76" n="4"> 
<p>While raising the mound the Peloponnesians also brought up engines against the city, one of which was brought up upon the mound against the great building and shook down a good piece of it, to the no small alarm of the Plataeans. Others were advanced against different parts of the wall but were lassoed and broken by the Plataeans; who also hung up great beams by long iron chains from either extremity of two poles laid on the wall and projecting over it, and drew them up at an angle whenever any point was threatened by the engine, and loosing their hold let the beam go with its chains slack, so that it fell with a run and snapped off the nose of the battering ram. </p> </div> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">After this the Peloponnesians, finding that their engines effected nothing, and that their mound was met by the counter-work, concluded that their present means of offence were unequal to the taking of the city, and prepared for its circumvallation.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.77" n="2"> 
<p>First, however, they determined to try the effects of fire and see whether they could not, with the help of a wind, burn the town as it was not a large one; indeed they thought of every possible expedient by which the place might be reduced without the expense of a blockade.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:2.77" n="3"> 
<p>They accordingly brought faggots of brushwood and threw them from the mound, first into the space between it and the wall; and this soon becoming full from the number of hands at work, they next heaped the faggots up as far into the town as they could reach from the top, and then lighted the wood by setting fire to it with sulphur and pitch.</p> </div>

<p>And this fire was not only remarkable for its magnitude, but was also, at the end of so many perils, within an ace of proving fatal to the Plataeans; a great part of the town became entirely inaccessible, and had a wind blown upon it, in accordance with the hopes of the enemy, nothing could have saved them.</p> </div>

Later on, one may say, the whole Hellenic world was convulsed; struggles being everywhere made by the popular chiefs to bring in the Athenians, and by the oligarchs to introduce the Lacedaemonians. In peace there would have been neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation; but in war, with an alliance always at the command of either faction for the hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage, opportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the revolutionary parties.</p> </div>

Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question inaptness to act on any.

To succeed in a plot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but to try to provide against having to do either was to break up your party and to be afraid of your adversaries. In fine, to forestall an intending criminal, or to suggest the idea of a crime where it was wanting, was equally commended,</p> </div>

<p>The fair proposals of an adversary were met with jealous precautions by the stronger of the two, and not with a generous confidence. Revenge also was held of more account than self-preservation. Oaths of reconciliation, being only proffered on either side to meet an immediate difficulty, only held good so long as no other weapon was at hand; but when opportunity offered, he who first ventured to seize it and to take his enemy off his guard, thought this perfidious vengeance sweeter than an open one, since, considerations of safety apart, success by treachery won him the palm of superior intelligence.

Thus religion was in honor with neither party; but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was in high reputation. Meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished between the two, either for not joining in the quarrel, or because envy would not suffer them to escape. </p> </div> </div>

It was to annoy <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> that they crossed the frontier and built a fort in our country; and they are therefore, I imagine, our enemies wherever we may come up with them, and from wheresoever they may have come to act as enemies do.</p> </div>

All armies are alike in this: on going into action they get forced out rather on their right wing, and one and the other overlap with this their adversary's left; because fear makes each man do his best to shelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the right, thinking that the closer the shields are locked together the better will he be protected. The man primarily responsible for this is the first upon the right wing, who is always striving to withdraw from the enemy his unarmed side; and the same apprehension makes the rest follow him.</p> </div>

The Egestaeans now reminded the Athenians of the alliance made in the time of Laches, during the former Leontine war, and begged them to send a fleet to their aid, and among a number of other considerations urged as a capital argument, that if the Syracusans were allowed to go unpunished for their depopulation of Leontini, to ruin the allies still left to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and to get the whole power of the island into their hands, there would be a danger of their one day coming with a large force, as Dorians, to the aid of their Dorian brethren, and as colonists, to the aid of the Peloponnesians who had sent them out, and joining these in pulling down the Athenian empire.

It was not the king's interest, when the Peloponnesians were now their equals at sea, and in possession of some of the chief cities in his empire, to go out of his way to side with the Athenians whom he did not trust, when he might make friends of the Peloponnesians who had never injured him.</p> </div>

<p>Upon this the envoys proceeded to inform them that the recent change had been made to save the city, and not to ruin it or to deliver it over to the enemy, for they had already had an opportunity of doing this when he invaded the country during their government; that all the Five Thousand would have their proper share in the government; and that their hearers' relatives had neither outrage, as Chaereas had slanderously reported, nor other ill-treatment to complain of, but were all in undisturbed enjoyment of their property just as they had left them.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">The same summer at the time that the return of Alcibiades coupled with the general conduct of Tissaphernes had carried to its height the discontent of the Peloponnesians, who no longer entertained any doubt of his having joined the Athenians, Tissaphernes wishing, it would seem, to clear himself to them of these charges, prepared to go after the Phoenician fleet to <placeName key="perseus,Aspendos">Aspendus</placeName>, and invited Lichas to go with him; saying that he would appoint Tamos as his lieutenant to provide pay for the armament during his own absence.</p> </div>

<p>That one hundred and forty-seven Phoenician ships came as far as <placeName key="perseus,Aspendos">Aspendus</placeName> is certain; but why they did not come on has been variously accounted for. Some think that he went away in pursuance of his plan of wasting the Peloponnesian resources, since at any rate Tamos, his lieutenant, far from being any better, proved a worse paymaster than himself: others that he brought the Phoenicians to <placeName key="perseus,Aspendos">Aspendus</placeName> to exact money from them for their discharge, having never intended to employ them: others again that it was in view of the outcry against him at <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, in order that it might be said that he was not in fault, but that the ships were really manned and that he had certainly gone to fetch them.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:8.87" n="4"> 
<p>To myself it seems only too evident that he did not bring up the fleet because he wished to wear out and paralyse the Hellenic forces, that is, to waste their strength by the time lost during his journey to <placeName key="perseus,Aspendos">Aspendus</placeName>, and to keep them evenly balanced by not throwing his weight into either scale. Had he wished to finish the war, he could have done so, assuming of course that he made his appearance in a way which left no room for doubt; as by bringing up the fleet he would in all probability have given the victory to the Lacedaemonians, whose navy, even as it was, faced the Athenian more as an equal than as an inferior.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng6:8.87" n="5"> 
<p>But what convicts him most clearly, is the excuse which he put forward for not bringing the ships.
