<head>PREFACE.</head>

<p>THE object of this volume is to give a version of the original so strictly faithful as to be of service to the classical student; while the style, though perfectly simple and unpretending, may contain nothing so opposed to the idiom of our own language as to deter the general reader, who may wish to know exactly what the Greek historian wrote. To gain both these ends, however, except in a limited degree, is perhaps scarcely possible in translating an author like Thucydides; whose style is frequently so very obscure, as regards the meaning, and so totally different, as regards the form and arrangement of his narrative, from what we are accustomed to in our own writers of history. It may be well therefore to say, that wherever the two parts of the object I have mentioned seemed incompatible, the latter, as the less important, has been sacrificed to the former; particularly in the earlier part of the work, where the student naturally stands most in need of every help that can be given him. With this explanation, I venture to hope that the present version may be found, in not a few passages, to answer the end proposed better than any of those which preceded it. The very great additions which within the last few years have been made to our knowledge of the original, may reasonably exempt the expression of such a hope from the charge of arrogance. And though want of leisure, arising from more pressing occupations, has prevented my deriving all the benefit I might, have done from the works of more learned labourers in the same field, yet even an imperfect acquaintance with the annotations of such scholars as have recently edited Thucydides, could scarcely fail to give me a decided advantage over earlier translators. To one of those scholars, especially, I am bound most thankfully to acknowledge my very great obligations; though his eye is, alas! closed to such expressions of gratitude. It was under the personal instruction of Dr. Arnold that I had the happiness to make my first acquaintance with the language of his favourite author; and his annotations upon the work have never long been out of my hands, since they were first published. The text of his last edition is what I have adopted for this translation; and I have sometimes felt compelled to borrow the very words with which he rendered a difficult passage; for when his version was meant to be literal, it seemed almost impossible to change it without sacrificing some part of the sense. The very few notes, too, which were compatible with the form and design of the volume, are in many cases only extracts from, or references to, his more copious illustrations of the text: though the views of other editors, particularly of Haack, Bekker, Göller, Poppo, and Bloomfield, are also quoted on doubtful passages, where my mind was not quite made up, with respect either to the best reading, or the most probable interpretation. With such valuable aids at my command, my task might well have been executed far better than it is. But such as it is, I commit it very humbly to the judgment of the public; more particularly of those who are acquainted with the original, and will therefore be best able to appreciate the difficulties which a translator of Thucydides has to encounter</p>

<quote> neither of these expressions can be admitted.

</quote> I have preferred the latter, both because the participial clause might very naturally be inserted in this parenthetical way; and from reference to a very similar passage in the beginning of chap. 20, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μὲν οὖν παλαιὰ τοιαῦτα εὖρον, χαλεπὰ ὄντα παντὶ ἑξῆς τεκμηρίῳ πιστεῦσαι.</foreign> Schäfer, as quoted by Göller, supplies <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ</foreign> from the antecedent clause.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυμβαίνει</foreign> seems here to express simply a <hi rend="italic">result,</hi> without implying any thing of its fortuitous nature, as it more commonly does.</note> from such evidence as I am led to trust, on looking back as far as possible, I do not think they were great, either with respect to wars or otherwise.

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="cts:urn:tlg0003.tlg001.1st1K-eng2:1.2" n="2"><p> For as there was no traffic, and they did not mix with one another without fear, either by sea or land; and they each so used what they had as but barely to live on it, without having any superfluity of riches, or planting their land, (because it was uncertain when another should invade them, and carry all away, especially as they had not the defence of walls;) and as they thought that they might any where obtain their necessary daily sustenance, they made little difficulty in removing: and for this cause they were not strong, either in greatness of cities, or other resources.

For such as by war or sedi tion were driven out of the rest of Greece, the most powerful of them retired to Athens, as to a place of security; and becoming citizens at a very early period, made the city still greater in the number of inhabitants; so that afterwards they even sent out colonies into Ionia, as Attica itself was not able to contain them.

<note xml:lang="eng" place="unspecified"> i. e. there were different tribes, of which the Pelasgian was the predominant one, called by their different names, instead of being all comprehended under one, as they were afterwards. Or it may refer to the gradual formation of such general names even at that early period, by one tribe extending its own appellation to others.</note> But when Hellen and his sons had grown strong in Phthiotis, and men invited them for their aid into the other cities; from associating with them, separate communities were now more commonly called Hellenes:

<note xml:lang="mul" place="unspecified"> For a striking instance of such a change in the language of a barbarian people at a much later period, I may refer to the inhabitants of the Amphilochian Argos, of whom Thucydides says, II. 68, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑλληνίσθησαν τὴν νῦν γλῶσσαν τότε πρῶτον ἀπὸ τῶν αμπρακιωτῶν ξυνοικησάντων: οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ʼαμφίλοχοι βάρ́βαροί

Nor again does he speak of barbarians; because neither were the Hellenes, in my opinion, as yet distinguished by one common term in opposition to that.

For Pylus is about four hundred stades from Sparta, and is situated in what was once the Messenian territory, being called by the Lacedaemonians Coryphasium.

That this was a proof that they would also endure like men any other even of the greatest perils, if [by their so doing] their affairs should be arranged to their satisfaction; in short, that he should consider them as truly the most faithful allies of the Lacedaemonians, and show them all other proofs of his respect. </p>

He was carrying on also some communications with those towns, with a view to their being betrayed to him. And thus he was meditating an attack on these places. </p>

Nor, again, does it seem at all like the style of Thucydides to allude so cursorily, and by anticipation, to the Pythian games, as the cause which put a final stop to hostilities, and to make no subsequent mention of them at all in what would be the natural place for doing so; but to lead his readers to conclude that the proposals for peace originated solely in the difficulties of both the great belligerent powers, and their natural anxiety to be released from them; which is the sum and substance of his history from chap. 13 to 17.</note> continued till the Pythian games, and then ended.

But surely they might share the jealousy and suspicion which, we are told, were excited throughout the whole of the Peloponnese by the clause of the treaty empowering Sparta and Athens to make alterations in it by themselves, without the consent of the allies in general. Chap. 29. 3. At any rate, such a clause seems quite incompatible with the supposition of the Megareans and Boeotians having been treated at this particular time, however they might have been in general, with that extreme respect and attention which Poppo speaks of, and which Göller and other commentators consider to be expressed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιορώμενοι.</foreign> The absence of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ,</foreign> which one would certainly have expected, to mark the opposition between the two clauses, may in some measure be supplied by the adversative force which I have given to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί;</foreign> that conjunction in Attic writers sometimes passing into the signification of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καίτοι.</foreign> See Jelf, Gr.

</quote> The verb is very frequently used in a manner closely approaching to this, as well as the cognate ones from which it borrows some of its tenses; but in such cases it is usually followed by a participle, infinitive, or adjective, which serves to limit its meaning to some particular case. If, however, it should be thought possible for it to have been here used without such limitation, it would give a very good reason why the states should prefer the Lacedaemonians alliance to that of the restless and meddling Athenians. It would also express an important difference between the case of the Megareans and Boeotians and that of the Eleans, with whose policy towards the Lepreans Sparta is mentioned as having interfered; and that of the Mantineans, who are expressly said to have abandoned their connexion with her, because they expected similar interference Ch. 29. 1, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνόμιζον οὐ περιόψεσθαι σθᾶς τους λακεδαιμονίους ἄρχειν, ἐπειδὴ καὶ σχολὴν ἦγον</foreign></note> neglected by the Lacedaemonians, and yet thinking that the democracy of the Argives was less suited to them, with their oligarchical form of government, than the constitution of the Lacedaemonians. </p>

Göller and Bloomfield put the comma after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτην,</foreign> and read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσέβαλλον:</foreign> but to this there is what appears to me an insuperable objection. Often as the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσβάλλω</foreign> occurs in Thucydides, it is never used, when speaking of a <hi rend="italic">country,</hi> to signify a continuance of offensive measures; but always expresses the one definite act of crossing an enemy's borders and invading his territory; and the case is the same with regard to the cognate substantive <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσβολή.</foreign> The imperfect tense therefore, though quite appropriate for expressing the ravages which troops continued to make when once in the country, is inappropriate with reference to the invasion itself; and could only be used with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα τὸν

<foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ καθ᾽ ὅν χρόνον ἐν τῇ ʼεπιδαύρῳ οἱ ʼαργεῖοι ἦσαν.</foreign>

Bp. Thirlwall adopts that of Portus, Acacius, and Hoffmann;

The supposition of such a change is warranted by the variation in the tenses of the verbs; and is the only way of solving the difficulty noticed by Dobree— that the depth of the line in each lochus appears to be left to the discretion of its commander, even after the number of men in the front rank of all of them has been said to have been uniformly four; though after this had once been settled, the other must, of course, have been no less uniform.

Or, if this should be thought inconsistent with the terms in which the counter-wall is afterwards described, ch. 42. 4, the joint operations here spoken of, may perhaps refer more generally to the building of out-works, extending at intervals up to it; especially as three such <foreign xml:lang="grc">προτειχίσματα</foreign> are actually mentioned as existing there, (ch. 43. 4,) though we are not expressly told when they were raised.—With regard to the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνετείχισαν</foreign> being used with reference to the nominative <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ νῆες,</foreign> I cannot agree with Arnold that

When, however, they were convinced of it, they were angry with those of the orators who had joined in promoting the expedition; (as though they had not voted for it themselves;) and were enraged with the soothsayers and reciters of oracles, and whoever at that time by any practice of divination had put them on hoping that they should subdue Sicily.

For they were at once weighed down by the loss which every man individually, as well as the whole state at large, had experienced, by the destruction of so many heavy-armed, and horsemen, and troops in the flower of their youth, like which they saw they had none left; and at the same time being aware that they had no competent number of ships in the docks, nor money in the treasury, nor crews for their vessels, they were at present without hope of saving themselves. They thought, too, that they should have their enemies in Sicily directly sailing with their fleet against the Piraeus, especially after they had gained such a victory; and that their foes at home, then doubly equipped on all points, would surely now press them with all their might, both by land and by sea, and their own allies with them in revolt.

He acceded to their proposals, and sent for Alcamenes son of Sthenelaidas, and for Melanthus, to come from Sparta and take the command in Euboea. Accordingly they came with about three hundred of the Neodamodes, and he began to prepare for their crossing over.

And at this time the allies obeyed him, one might say, much more than the Lacedaemonians in the city: for he was feared, because he went every where in person with a force at his command. He, then, furthered the views of the Lesbians. The Chians and Erythraeans, on the other hand, who were also ready to revolt, made their application, not to Agis, but at Sparta.

Others, that after bringing the Phoenicians to Aspendus, he might exact money from them for their discharge; (for under no circumstances did he intend to employ them on any service.)

For had he wished to bring the war to a conclusion, it is surely evident that he <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have done it without any doubt.

As for Tissaphernes, when he heard that the Peloponnesian squadron had sailed from Miletus to the Hellespont, he set out again from Aspendus, and proceeded to Ionia.

Accordingly he went first to Ephesus, and offered sacrifice to Diana. </p>
