				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The words to be pronounced above this grave, a

					nor better men than these now dead nor more resplendent actions. Indeed my
					greatest doubt today is lest my speech may prove unworthy of their exploits.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="2">
				<p>I am, however, taking heart in this assurance: that what I leave unsaid will be
					supplied by you who hear me; for my listeners will be no random audience but the
					persons who themselves have witnessed the actions of these men. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="3">
				<p>While praise is due to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for her
					policy, for choosing as she did a course not only ranking with her past
					achievements but even surpassing them in pride and honor, and to the fallen also
					for their gallantry in battle, for proving worthy of their forbears' valor, to
					Leosthenes the general it is doubly due; the city's guide in framing her
					decision, he was besides the citizens' commander in the field. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="4">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the case of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
						>Athens</placeName>, to recount in detail the benefits which she has
					previously conferred upon the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
						>Greece</placeName> would be a task too great to compass in the time we
					have, nor is the occasion one for lengthy speaking. Indeed it is not easy for a
					single man, faced with so many noble actions, to recall the full story to your
					minds. I shall, however, venture one general comment on her. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="5">
				<p>Compare her with the sun which visits the whole world and duly separates the
					seasons, disposing all things for the best, with provision, where men are
					virtuous and prudent, for their birth and nurture, the crops and all the other
					needs of life; for so our city never fails to punish the wicked, help the just,
					mete out to all men fairness in place of wrong, and at her individual peril and
					expense assure the Greeks a common safety. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="6">
				<p>To deal with the achievements of the city as a whole is, as I said before, a task
					which I shall not attempt, and I will here confine myself to Leosthenes and his
					companions. At what point, then, shall I take up the story? What shall I mention
					first? Shall I trace the ancestry of each? </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="7">
				<p>To do so would, I think, be foolish. Granted, if one is praising men of a
					different stamp, such as have gathered from diverse places into the city which
					they inhabit, each contributing his lineage to the common stock, then one must
					trace their separate ancestry. But from one who speaks of Athenians, born of
					their own country and sharing a lineage of unrivalled purity, a eulogy of the
					descent of each must surely be superfluous. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="8">
				<p>Am I then to touch upon their education, and, as other speakers often do, remind
					you how as children they were reared and trained in strict self-discipline? None
					of us, I think, is unaware that our aim in training children is to convert them
					into valiant men; and that men who have proved of exceptional courage in war
					were well brought up in childhood needs no stressing. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="9">
				<p>The simplest course, I think, will be to tell you of their courage under arms,
					revealing them as authors of many benefits conferred upon their country and the
					rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. First I shall take the
					general, as is his due. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="10">
				<p>For Leosthenes perceived that the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
						>Greece</placeName> was humiliated and . . . cowed, corrupted by men who
					were accepting bribes from Philip and Alexander against their native countries.
					He realized that our city stood in need of a commander, and <placeName
						key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> herself of a city, able to assume the
					leadership, and he gave himself to his country and the city to the Greeks, in
					the cause of freedom. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="11">
				<p>After raising a mercenary force he took command of the citizen army and defeated
					the first opponents of Greek freedom, the Boeotians, Macedonians and Euboeans,
					together with their other allies, in battle in <placeName key="tgn,7002683"
						>Boeotia</placeName>. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="12">
				<p>Thence he advanced to Pylae<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In fact Leosthenes
						seems to have occupied <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
							>Thermopylae</placeName> before his victory in <placeName
							key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.</note> and occupied the pass
					through which, in bygone days as well, barbarians marched against the Greeks. He
					thus prevented the inroad of Antipater into <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
						>Greece</placeName>, and overtaking him in that vicinity, defeated him in
					battle and shut him into <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName>, which
					he then besieged. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="13">
				<p>The Thessalians, Phocians, Aetolians, and all the other peoples of the region, he
					made his allies, bringing under his control, by their own consent, the men whom
					Philip and Alexander gloried in controlling against their wish. The
					circumstances subject to his will he mastered, but fate he could not overpower.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="14">
				<p>Leosthenes must have first claim upon our gratitude for ever, not only for the
					acts performed by him, but also for the later battle, fought after his death,
					and for those other triumphs which the Greeks have gained in this campaign. For
					on the foundations laid by Leosthenes the subsequent success of his survivors
					rests. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="15">
				<p>Let no one fancy that I disregard the other citizens and keep my eulogy for him
					alone. The praise bestowed upon Leosthenes for these engagements is in fact a
					tribute to the rest. For though sound strategy depends upon the leader, success
					in battle is ensured by those who are prepared to risk their lives; and
					therefore, in the praise that I bestow upon the victory gained, I shall be
					commending not merely the leadership of Leosthenes but the courage of his
					comrades too. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="16">
				<p>For who could rightly grudge his praise to those of our citizens who fell in this
					campaign, who gave their lives for the freedom of the Greeks, convinced that the
					surest proof of their desire to guarantee the liberty of <placeName
						key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was to die in battle for her? </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="17">
				<p>One circumstance did much to reinforce their purpose as champions of <placeName
						key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>: the fact that the earlier battle was
					fought in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">The points which Hyperides makes in this and in the
						following section will not bear examination. For (1) the first victory was
						gained in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea"
							>Plataea</placeName>, not within sight of <placeName
							key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>; (2) the second battle was
						probably fought near <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> in
							<placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>, and its site could
						not be seen from <placeName key="perseus,Anthela">Anthela</placeName> where
						the Amphictyonic council met. Moreover, the council met there only once a
						year and could hardly be called representative of the whole of <placeName
							key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</note> They saw that the city of
						<placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> had been tragically
					annihilated from the face of the earth, that its citadel was garrisoned by the
					Macedonians, and that the persons of its inhabitants were in slavery, while
					others parcelled out the land among themselves. And so these threats, revealed
					before their eyes, gave them an undaunted courage to meet danger gladly. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="18">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yet the action fought near Pylae and <placeName
						key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName> has proved to be as glorious for them
					as the conflict in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, not solely
					through the circumstances of victory in the field, over Antipater and his
					allies, but on the grounds of situation also. The fact that this has been the
					battle's site will mean that all the Greeks, repairing twice a year to the
					council of the Amphictyones, will witness their achievements; for by the very
					act of gathering in that spot they will recall the valor of these men. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="19">
				<p>Never before did men strive for a nobler cause, either against stronger
					adversaries or with fewer friends, convinced that valor gave strength and
					courage superiority as no mere numbers could. Liberty they gave us as an
					offering for all to share, but the honor of their deeds they have bestowed upon
					their country as a wreath for her alone. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="20">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now we might well reflect what, in our opinion,
					the outcome would have been, had these men failed to do their duty in the
					struggle. Must we not suppose that the whole world would be under one master,
					and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> compelled to tolerate his
					whim as law? In short that Macedonian arrogance, and not the power of justice,
					would lord it among every people. . . .<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Various
						attempts have been made to restore this corrupt passage, from which some
						words seem to have dropped out, but none is wholly satisfactory. In any case
						the sense appears to be that outrages on women, girls, and children would
						continue without pause in every city.</note>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="21">
				<p>The practices which even now we have to countenance are proof enough: sacrifices
					being made to men; images, altars, and temples carefully perfected in their
					honor, while those of the gods are neglected, and we ourselves are forced to
					honor as heroes the servants of these people. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="22">
				<p>If reverence for the gods has been removed by Macedonian insolence, what fate
					must we conclude would have befallen the rules of conduct towards man? Would
					they not have been utterly discounted? The more terrible therefore we think the
					consequences would have been, the greater must be the praise which we believe
					the dead have earned. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="23">
				<p>For no campaign has better shown the courage of the soldiers than this last, when
					they had daily to be arrayed for combat, to fight, on but one expedition, more
					battles than the combats which any soldier of the past endured,<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">The exaggeration of this remark has led some editors to
						doubt the reading.</note> and face extreme severities of weather and many
					hard privations in the daily needs of life with an endurance almost beyond
					description. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="24">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such trials Leosthenes induced the citizens to
					brave undaunted, and they gave up their persons gladly to share the struggle
					with so great a leader. Should they not then be counted fortunate in their
					display of valor rather than unfortunate in their sacrifice of life? For in
					exchange for a mortal body they gained undying glory, safeguarding by their
					personal courage the universal liberty of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
						>Greece</placeName>. . . .<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Greek words
						which follow here cannot be translated as they stand. Fritzsche's emendation
						probably restores the correct sense, namely: “Nothing brings complete
						happiness without self-government.” But the Greek wording is
						uncertain.</note>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="25">
				<p>If men are to be happy, the voice of law, and not a ruler's threats, must reign
					supreme; if they are free, no groundless charge, but only proof of guilt, must
					cause them apprehension; nor must the safety of our citizens depend on those who
					slander them and truckle to their masters but on the force of law alone. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="26">
				<p>Such were the aims with which these men accepted labor upon labor, and with the
					dangers of the passing hour dispelled the terrors which the whole future held
					for citizens and Greeks, sacrificing their lives that others might live well.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="27">
				<p>To them we owe it that fathers have grown famous, and mothers looked up to in the
					city, that sisters, through the benefit of law, have made, and will make,
					marriages worthy of them, that children too will find a passport to the people's
					hearts in these men's valor; these men who, far from dying—death is no word to
					use where lives are lost, as theirs were, for a noble cause—have passed from
					this existence to an eternal state. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="28">
				<p>For if the fact of death, to others a most grievous ill, has brought to them
					great benefits, are we not wrong indeed to count them wretched or to conclude
					that they have left the realm of life? Should we not rather say they have been
					born anew, a nobler birth than the first? Mere children then, they had no
					understanding, but now they have been born as valiant men. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="29">
				<p>Formerly they stood in need of time and many dangers to reveal their courage;
					now, with that courage as a base, they have become known to all, to be
					remembered for their valor. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="30">
				<p>On what occasion shall we fail to recollect the prowess of these men, in what
					place fail to see them win their due of emulation and the highest praise? What
					if the city prospers? Surely the successes, which they have earned, will bring
					their praises, and none other's, to our lips and to our memories. Shall we then
					forget them in times of personal satisfaction? We cannot; for it is through
					their valor that we shall have the safe enjoyment of those moments. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="31">
				<p>Will there be men of any age who will not count them blessed? What of the older
					generation, who think that through the efforts of these men they have been
					placed in safety and will pass the rest of their lives free from dread? Consider
					their compeers . . .<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The sense is supplied by
							<placeName key="tgn,1029705">Kenyon</placeName> as follows: “To them it
						has been given, because these died in battle, to enjoy their lives in honor
						and safety.”</note>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="32">
				<p>Think, too, of the younger men and boys. Will they not envy their death and
					strive themselves to take as an example these men's lives, in place of which
					they have left behind their valor? </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="33">
				<p>Ought we then to count them happy in so great an honor?<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">The missing passage from <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/
							ti/nes</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| pole/mw|</foreign>
						has been tentatively restored by Blass and <placeName key="tgn,1029705"
							>Kenyon</placeName> to give the following sense: “Neither poets nor
						philosophers will be in want of words or song in which to celebrate their
						deeds to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. Surely this
						expedition will be more famed in every land than that which overthrew the
						Phrygians. Throughout all time in every part of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
							>Greece</placeName> these exploits will be praised in verse and song.
						Leosthenes himself and those who perished with him in the war will have a
						double claim to be revered.”</note> . . . </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="34">
				<p>For if it is for pleasure that men recall such feats of courage, what could be
					more pleasing to Greeks than the praise of those who gave them freedom from the
					Macedonian yoke? Or if it is desire for profit that prompts such recollections,
					what speech could be of greater profit to the hearts of those about to hear it
					than one which is to honor courage and brave men? </p>
			</div>
			<div type="section" n="35">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With us and all mankind, it is clear, in the light
					of these reflections, that their fame is now assured, but what of the lower
					world? Who, we may well ask ourselves, are waiting there to welcome the leader

					wonder, those of the so-called demi-gods who sailed against <placeName
						key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>: heroes whom he so far excelled, though
					his exploits were akin to theirs, that they with all <placeName
						key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> at their side took but one city, while

			</div>
			<div type="section" n="39">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Those too, I fancy, who gave the people the surest
					token of their mutual friendship, Harmodius and Aristogiton,<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">The sense appears to be that they regard no one as so
						suitable to rank with themselves as Leosthenes and his comrades. Harmodius

						put to death, were later looked upon as liberators of the city. They and
						their descendants, who enjoyed special privileges, are not infrequently
						referred to by the orators. Compare <bibl n="Din. 1.63">Din. 1.63</bibl> and

			<div type="section" n="42">
				<p>For though their fate deserves our tears, their conduct claims the highest
