<p>I am, however, taking heart in this assurance: that what I leave unsaid will be supplied by you who hear me; for my listeners will be no random audience but the persons who themselves have witnessed the actions of these men. </p>

<p>While praise is due to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for her policy, for choosing as she did a course not only ranking with her past achievements but even surpassing them in pride and honor, and to the fallen also for their gallantry in battle, for proving worthy of their forbears’ valor, to Leosthenes the general it is doubly due; the city’s guide in framing her decision, he was besides the citizens’ commander in the field. </p>
	</div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="4">
<p rend="align(indent)">In the case of <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName>, to recount in detail the benefits which she has previously conferred upon the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName> would be a task too great to compass in the time we have, nor is the occasion one for lengthy speaking. Indeed it is not easy for a single man, faced with so many noble actions, to recall the full story to your minds. I shall, however, venture one general comment on her. </p>
	</div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="5">
<p>Compare her with the sun which visits the whole world and duly separates the seasons, disposing all things for the best, with provision, where men are virtuous and prudent, for their birth and nurture, the crops and all the other needs of life; for so our city never fails to punish the wicked, help the just, mete out to all men fairness in place of wrong, and at her individual peril and expense assure the Greeks a common safety. </p>
	</div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="6">
<p>To deal with the achievements of the city as a whole is, as I said before, a task which I shall not attempt, and I will here confine myself to Leosthenes and his companions. At what point, then, shall I take up the story? What shall I mention first? Shall I trace the ancestry of each? </p>
	</div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="7">
<p>To do so would, I think, be foolish. Granted, if one is praising men of a different stamp, such as have gathered from diverse places into the city which they inhabit, each contributing his lineage to the common stock, then one must trace their separate ancestry. But from one who speaks of Athenians, born of their own country and sharing a lineage of unrivalled purity, a eulogy of the descent of each must surely be superfluous. </p>
	</div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="8">
<p>Am I then to touch upon their education, and, as other speakers often do, remind you how as children they were reared and trained in strict self-discipline? None of us, I think, is unaware that our aim in training children is to convert them into valiant men; and that men who have proved of exceptional courage in war were well brought up in childhood needs no stressing. </p>
	</div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="9">
<p>The simplest course, I think, will be to tell you of their courage under arms, revealing them as authors of many benefits conferred upon their country and the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. First I shall take the general, as is his due. </p>

He realized that our city stood in need of a commander, and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> herself of a city, able to assume the leadership, and he gave himself to his country and the city to the Greeks, in the cause of freedom. </p>

<p>After raising a mercenary force he took command of the citizen army and defeated the first opponents of Greek freedom, the Boeotians, Macedonians and Euboeans, together with their other allies, in battle in <placeName key="tgn,7002683" >Boeotia</placeName>. </p>

He thus prevented the inroad of Antipater into <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName>, and overtaking him in that vicinity, defeated him in battle and shut him into <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName>, which he then besieged. </p>

<p>The Thessalians, Phocians, Aetolians, and all the other peoples of the region, he made his allies, bringing under his control, by their own consent, the men whom Philip and Alexander gloried in controlling against their wish.

<p>Leosthenes must have first claim upon our gratitude for ever, not only for the acts performed by him, but also for the later battle, fought after his death, and for those other triumphs which the Greeks have gained in this campaign. For on the foundations laid by Leosthenes the subsequent success of his survivors rests. </p>

<p>Let no one fancy that I disregard the other citizens and keep my eulogy for him alone. The praise bestowed upon Leosthenes for these engagements is in fact a tribute to the rest. For though sound strategy depends upon the leader, success in battle is ensured by those who are prepared to risk their lives; and therefore, in the praise that I bestow upon the victory gained, I shall be commending not merely the leadership of Leosthenes but the courage of his comrades too. </p>

<p>For who could rightly grudge his praise to those of our citizens who fell in this campaign, who gave their lives for the freedom of the Greeks, convinced that the surest proof of their desire to guarantee the liberty of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was to die in battle for her? </p>

<p>One circumstance did much to reinforce their purpose as champions of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>: the fact that the earlier battle was fought in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.<note resp="editor" anchored="true">The points which Hyperides makes in this and in the following section will not bear examination. For (1) the first victory was gained in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea" >Plataea</placeName>, not within sight of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>; (2) the second battle was probably fought near <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> in <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>, and its site could not be seen from <placeName key="perseus,Anthela">Anthela</placeName> where the Amphictyonic council met. Moreover, the council met there only once a year and could hardly be called representative of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</note> They saw that the city of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> had been tragically annihilated from the face of the earth, that its citadel was garrisoned by the Macedonians, and that the persons of its inhabitants were in slavery, while others parcelled out the land among themselves. And so these threats, revealed before their eyes, gave them an undaunted courage to meet danger gladly. </p>
	</div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="18">
<p rend="align(indent)">Yet the action fought near Pylae and <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName> has proved to be as glorious for them as the conflict in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, not solely through the circumstances of victory in the field, over Antipater and his allies, but on the grounds of situation also. The fact that this has been the battle’s site will mean that all the Greeks, repairing twice a year to the council of the Amphictyones, will witness their achievements; for by the very act of gathering in that spot they will recall the valor of these men. </p>

<p>Never before did men strive for a nobler cause, either against stronger adversaries or with fewer friends, convinced that valor gave strength and courage superiority as no mere numbers could.
