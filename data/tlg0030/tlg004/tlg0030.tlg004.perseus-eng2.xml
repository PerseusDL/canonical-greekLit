At one time the men impeached before you were Timomachus, Leosthenes, Callistratus, Philon of Anaea, Theotimus who lost <placeName key="perseus,Sestos">Sestos</placeName>, and others of the same type.<note resp="editor">Timomachus was an Athenian general who failed in his command against Cotys of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> (c. <date>361</date> B.C.), and on his return to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was condemned either to death or to a heavy fine. See <bibl n="Dem. 19.180">Dem. 19.180</bibl>, and the scholiast on <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.56">Aeschin. 1.56</bibl>. Leosthenes, who led an Athenian fleet against Alexander of Pherae (c. <date>361</date> B.C.), lost five triremes, was condemned to death at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and went into exile. See <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.124">Aeschin. 2.124</bibl>, and <bibl n="Diod. 15.95">Diod. Sic. 15.95.2</bibl>. For Callistratus, a prominent orator, exiled at about the same time and later put to death, see <bibl n="Lyc. 1.93">Lyc. 1.93</bibl>. Theotimus, also about the year 361, was impeached for losing <placeName key="perseus,Sestos">Sestos</placeName> to Cotys. Of PhiIon nothing further is known.</note> Some were accused of betraying ships, others of giving up Athenian cities, and another, an orator, of speaking against the people’s interests. </p>

                <p>Though there were five of them, not one waited to be tried; they left the city of their own accord and went into exile. The same is true of many others who were impeached. In fact it was a rare thing to see anyone subjected to impeachment appearing in court. So serious and so notorious were the crimes which at that time led to an impeachment. But the present practice in the city is utterly absurd. </p>

                <p rend="align(indent)">And yet in public trials, gentlemen of the jury, the jury should refuse to listen to the details of the prosecution until they have first considered the point at issue, and also the written statement of the accused, to see if the pleas are legally valid. It is certainly wrong to maintain, as Polyeuctus did in his speech for the prosecution, that defendants should not insist on the impeachment law; which lays it down that impeachments shall be reserved for the orators themselves, when they speak against the interests of the people, but shall not apply to every Athenian.</p>

                <p>With me this law would have first claim to notice; and a point, I think, which should be dwelt on as much as any, is how to ensure that the laws in a democracy are binding and that impeachments and other actions brought into court are legally valid. It was with this in view that you made separate laws covering individually all offences committed in the city. </p>

                <p>Suppose someone commits a religious offence. There is the method of public prosecution before the King-Archon. Or he maltreats his parents. The Archon presides over his case. Someone makes illegal proposals in the city. There is the board of Thesmothetae ready. Perhaps he does something involving summary arrest. You have the authority of the Eleven.<note resp="editor" >The King-Archon, who supervised all religious ceremonies of state, judged all cases connected with religion, while the Archon himself dealt with family law. (See <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 57.2">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 57.2</bibl> and <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 56.6">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 56.6</bibl>.) For the Thesmothetae compare <bibl n="Hyp. 1.12">Hyp. 1.12</bibl> and note. Summary arrest could be legally employed against three classes of criminal. Of these, two were tried by the Eleven and one by the Thesmothetae. (See <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 52.1">Aristot. Ath. Po1. 52.1</bibl>.)</note> Similarly, to deal with every other offence you have established laws, offices, and courts appropriate to each. </p>

                <p>In what cases then do you think impeachments should be used? Your answer has already been embodied in detail in the law, so as to leave no room for doubt. <q rend="double">If any person,</q> it says, <q rend="double">seeks to overthrow the democracy of the Athenians.</q> Naturally, gentlemen of the jury; for a charge like that admits of no excuse from anyone nor of an oath for postponement.<note resp="editor">A man due to be tried could offer the court an excuse (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σκῆφις</foreign>) and provide a second party to take an oath (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπωμοσία</foreign>) that this excuse was true.

                <p>You would have been insane if you had framed the law in any other way; if, when the orators enjoy both the honors and the profits of speaking, you had exposed the ordinary citizen to the risks that go with them. Nevertheless, Polyeuctus is bold enough to assert, though he is bringing in an impeachment, that defendants must not make use of the impeachment law. </p>

                <p>All other prosecutors who think it necessary, when speaking first, to steal the defendants’ arguments from them encourage the jury to refuse to listen to any defendant who does not keep within the scope of the law, to challenge his statements and tell the clerk to read the law. The opposite is true of you: it is recourse to law of which you think you should deprive Euxenippus in his defence. </p>

And yet, of the many good institutions of the city, what is better or more democratic<note resp="editor">Compare <bibl n="Hyp. 1.10">Hyp. 1.10</bibl>.</note> than our custom, when some private person is facing the danger of a trial and cannot conduct his own defence, of allowing any citizen who wishes to come forward to help him and give the jury a fair statement of the case? </p>

                <p>You will claim, no doubt, that you have never worked on such a principle.

Fr. 24">Hyp. Fr. 24</bibl> and<bibl n="Hyp. Fr. 25">Hyp. Fr. 25</bibl>.</note> you asked for ten advocates from the tribe Aegeis, and I was one of them, chosen by yourself. You also summoned men from other tribes into the court to help you. But why should I mention other instances? Take your handling of the present trial. Did you not make as many accusations as you wished? Did you not call Lycurgus to join you in the prosecution, a speaker who is the equal of any in the city and who has the reputation among these gentlemen of being sound and honorable? </p>

                <p>If you then, as a defendant, may summon advocates, or as a prosecutor may bring in co-prosecutors—you who are not merely capable of speaking for yourself but well able to give a whole city trouble—is Euxenippus, because he is not a professional speaker and is now advanced in years, even to be denied the help of friends and relatives, on pain of their being abused by you? </p>

                <p rend="align(indent)">Yes; for in the words of your indictment, his conduct has been scandalous and deserves the death penalty. Gentlemen of the jury, will you please review it and scrutinize it point by point? The people ordered Euxenippus, as one of three, to lie down in the temple; and he tells us that he fell asleep and had a dream which he reported to them. If you assumed, Polyeuctus, that this was true and that he reported to the people what he actually saw in his sleep, why is he to blame for notifying the Athenians of the commands which the god had been giving him? </p>

                <p>If on the other hand, as you now maintain, you thought that he misrepresented the god and, out of partiality for certain persons, had made a false report to the people, rather than propose a decree disputing the dream you ought to have sent to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, as the previous speaker said, and inquired the truth from the god. But instead of doing that, you proposed a decree, entirely conceived by yourself,<note resp="editor" >I follow Colin’s interpretation of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοτελής</foreign> in this passage, although it was often used technically to describe a decree laid before the people without previous consideration by the Council (see <bibl n="Hsch. a.8474.1" >Hesychius, sv. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοτελές ψήφισμα</foreign></bibl>).</note> against two tribes, a measure not only most unjust but self-contradictory also. This was what caused your conviction for illegal proposals. It was not the fault of Euxenippus. </p>

                <p rend="align(indent)">Let us consider it in this way. The tribes, formed into groups of two, shared out the mountains in Oropus awarded to them by the people. This mountain fell to the lot of Acamantis and Hippothoontis. You proposed that these tribes should restore the mountain to Amphiaraus and the price of produce from it which they had sold; your reason being that the fifty boundary officials had selected it beforehand and set it apart for the god, and that the two tribes had no right to be holding it. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg004.perseus-eng2" n="17">
                <p>A little later in the same decree you propose that the eight tribes shall provide compensation and pay it to the other two so that they shall not suffer unfairly. But if the mountain really belonged to the two tribes and you tried to take it from them, surely we are entitled to be angry. Alternatively, if they had no right to be occupying it and it belonged to the god, why were you proposing that the other tribes should actually pay them compensation? They should have been well content that when restoring the property of the god they did not also pay a fine in cash. </p>

So if you had been acquitted in your trial, Euxenippus would not have misrepresented the god: because you happened to be convicted, must ruin fall on him?<note resp="editor" >Apparently it was loss of prestige which caused Polyeuctus to be resentful against Euxenippus, since the actual fine was negligible.</note> And when you, who proposed a decree like that, were fined a mere twenty-five drachmas, is the man who lay down in the temple at the people’s request even to be refused a grave in <placeName key="tgn,7002681" >Attica</placeName>? </p>

The statue of Health stood on the Acropolis. (See <bibl n="Paus. 1.23.5">Paus. 1.23.5</bibl>.) It is not known how Euxenippus was connected with this affair.</note> You think that if you bring her name irrelevantly into the case to serve your own ends and accuse Euxenippus of deceitful flattery, you will bring down the jury’s hatred and anger upon him.

                <p>But you do not prosecute or bring to trial any of the people who are universally known to be doing these things, and yet you accuse Euxenippus of flattery when his manner of life disproves the charge. And yet if you had any sense, you would neither be blaming Euxenippus for the dedication of the cup nor have made any further mention of the affair, since it is impolitic to do so. Why is that? Will you please listen, gentlemen of the jury, to the account which I am going to give? </p>

Dione, a consort of Zeus, was often worshipped in his temples.</note> complaints which are unfair, as I have twice already proved in the Assembly before yourselves and the rest of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. I explained to her envoys that the charges she brings against the city are not justified. For Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> commanded you through the oracle to embellish the statue of Dione. </p>

                <p>You made a face as beautiful as you could, together with all the other appropriate parts; and having prepared a great deal of expensive finery for the goddess and dispatched envoys with a sacrifice at great expense, you embellished the statue of Dione in a manner worthy of yourselves and of the goddess. These measures brought you the complaints of Olympias, who said in her letters that the country of Molossia, in which the temple stands, belonged to her, and that therefore we had no right to interfere with anything there at all. </p>

But if we acquiesce in what has been done we shall have taken away her right to these theatrical complaints and accusations.

But from the time when you decided to play a part in public life, for which I admit you are well fitted, you should not have prosecuted private individuals or made them the victims of your impudence. Wait for an orator to commit a crime and then prosecute him, or for a general to do wrong and then impeach him. These are the men who have power to harm the city, all of them who choose to do so, not Euxenippus or any member of this jury. </p>

                <p>Diopithes of Sphettus, thought to be the most formidable man in the city; Philocrates of Hagnus, whose political career has been marked by the utmost daring and wantonness. I prosecuted that man for his services to Philip against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and secured his conviction in court. The impeachment which I drew up was just and in accordance with the law, referring to him as <q rend="double">an orator giving counsel against the best interests of the people and receiving money and gifts from those working against them.</q> </p>

And again I added: <q rend="double">These further proposals he made against the best interests of the people, because he had taken bribes.</q> And I wrote the decree alongside. Indeed this statement is written down five or six times in my speech; for I thought that I must make the trial and the prosecution just. But you could not include in your impeachment the things which you allege Euxenippus to have said against the best interests of the people. Yet, though he is a private citizen, by your mode of prosecution you class him as an orator. </p>

                <p>After a scanty reference to the defendant’s written statement you are now bringing fresh charges and incriminations against him, mentioning, amongst other similar allegations, that he tried to marry his daughter to Philocles, that he undertook an arbitration for Demotion, and other similar charges.<note resp="Loeb">Nothing is known of Philocles and the reference to Demotion is obscure. He was clearly an unpopular character, perhaps the parasite feeder satirized by comedians (see <bibl n="Ath. 6.243">Athen. 6.243</bibl> b). The translation of the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc" >Δημοτίωνος δίαιταν ἔλαβενs</foreign> is doubtful; it might mean: <q rend="double">adopted the method of life of Demotion.</q></note> Your intention is that, if the defence neglect the main indictment and deal with the irrelevant allegations, the jury shall interrupt them by calling: <q rend="double">Why do you tell us this?</q> and if they ignore the additional points entirely their case shall be weakened.

                <p>The most outrageous feature of your speech was the fact that often during the argument you let fall the remark—you thought that your motive in doing so passed unnoticed, though it was obvious—that Euxenippus was rich, and again, a little later, that he had amassed great wealth dishonestly. It has surely nothing to do with this case whether he is a man of large means or small, and to raise the matter is malicious and implies an unfair assumption regarding the jury, namely that they would base their verdict on other considerations than the point at issue and the question whether the man on trial is offending against you or not. </p>

                <p>Let me give an instance. When Tisis of Agryle brought in an inventory of the estate of Euthycrates, amounting to more than sixty talents, on the grounds of its being public property, and again later promised to bring in an inventory of the estate of Philip and Nausicles saying that they had made their money from unregistered mines, this jury were so far from approving such a suggestion or coveting the property of others that they immediately disfranchised the man who tried to slander the accused and did not award him a fifth part of the votes.<note resp="editor">No other details are known of the cases mentioned here. An Epicrates of <placeName key="perseus,Pallene" >Pallene</placeName> is known to have been trierarch in <date>342</date> B.C.

                <p>Or take a recent instance, if you like, the verdict given by the jury last month, surely a most commendable decision. I refer to the case of Lysander, who reported that the mine of Epicrates of <placeName key="perseus,Pallene" >Pallene</placeName> had been bored beyond the boundaries. It had already been worked for three years and virtually the richest men in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> had shares in it. Lysander promised to secure three hundred talents for the city, since that, he claimed, was the sum which they had made from the mine. </p>

                <p>In spite of this the jury were governed, not by the accusers promises, but by the claims of justice. They decided that the mine was within its proper limits, and in one and the same verdict assured the safety of the men’s estates and guaranteed their working of the mine for the remainder of the period. That is why the excavation of new mines, neglected previously because men were afraid, is now in progress, and the city’s revenues from these are again being increased, revenues which some of our orators impaired by misleading the people and subjecting the mine-workers to tribute. </p>

On the contrary, he is the man who is anxious to keep what will be profitable to the city in the future, to preserve agreement among the citizens and safeguard your reputation. There are some who disregard these things. By taking money from contractors they claim that they are providing revenue, although it is the lack of it that they are really causing in the city.

Now if he were arguing that there were men outside the city with whom Euxenippus was co-operating on receipt of bribes, he would then be able to say that, since these persons could not be punished, their servants in the city must be brought to justice. But, in fact, he says that it is from Athenians that Euxenippus has had the gifts. For shame, sir; when you have here in the city the men who act against the people, do you let them be and choose instead to harass Euxenippus? </p>
