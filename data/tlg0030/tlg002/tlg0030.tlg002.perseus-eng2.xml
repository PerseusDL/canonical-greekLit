He had quite a reputation for wit and some of his sayings are preserved. As a descendant of one of the tyrant-slayers, probably of Aristogiton, who appears to have been a member of the tribe <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName>, he enjoyed free meals in the Prytaneum, a privilege to which apparently only the eldest of each line was entitled (<title>CIA</title>1.8; 2. 240).</note> who never leaves their sides <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . .

                <p>first because you needed no one but yourself to show you that the city is grateful to her benefactors, you who now enjoy the honors for services which other men once rendered; and secondly because the people drew up a law forbidding anyone to speak ill of Harmodius and Aristogeiton or sing disparaging songs about them.<note resp="editor">Harmodius and Aristogiton are mentioned again in <bibl n="Hyp. 6. 39">Hyp. 6. 39</bibl>. This particular privilege is not elsewhere recorded.</note> It is therefore scandalous that, though the people saw fit to prevent even a drunken man from abusing your ancestors, you should be speaking ill of the state even when you are sober. </p>

                <p rend="align(indent)">I have a few more points to make, gentlemen of the jury, and after summing up my argument will leave the platform. The case in which you are going to vote is an indictment for the proposing of illegal measures and the decree under consideration is one congratulating presidents.<note resp="editor">In the 4th century B.C. the chairman of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρυτάνεις</foreign> appointed these presidents by lot, one from each tribe except that to which he himself belonged, for each meeting of the Council or Assembly. After their appointment he drew lots among them for their chairman (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστάτης</foreign>). (See <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.104" >Aeschin. 1. 104</bibl>, <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.39">Aeschin. 3. 39</bibl>, and <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 44.2">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 44. 2</bibl>.)</note> Presidents should observe the law during their period of office. These men have broken it. As evidence for both these facts you heard the actual laws read. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="5">
                <p>The sequel now rests with you. For you will make it plain whether you are going to punish the proposers of illegal measures or whether you intend to grant those honors, which till now have been paid to your benefactors, to presidents whose conduct is not lawful; and that too when you have sworn to observe the laws in giving your vote. There is, however, one argument open to them, namely that the people were compelled to pass the votes of honor.<note resp="editor">i. e., the votes of honor for certain Macedonians. Hyperides agrees that it may have been impossible to avoid passing the votes of honor, but that there was no need to congratulate the presidents for having done so.</note> Even this cannot possibly mislead you; for it cannot be said that we were under any compulsion to crown the presidents. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0030.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="6">
                <p>Moreover the defendant has himself made your decision easy, since he stated in writing his reasons for crowning them. They had, he said, been just towards the Athenian people and observed the laws during their office. That is a statement for which you must now summon him to answer. And you, Philippides, show us that what you assumed about the presidents in your decree is true and you will be acquitted. </p>

                <p>But if you think that your usual vulgarity and joking will secure your pardon in court or win from these men any indulgence or sympathy to which you are not entitled, you are a fool and very far from the mark. You see, you laid up popularity for yourself, not in <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName>, but elsewhere. You thought fit to cringe before those whom the people feared rather than before the men who now have power to save you. </p>

                <p>You have concluded that one person will be immortal,<note resp="editor">This passage is important for determining the date of the speech. It has been held, e. g., by <placeName key="tgn,1029705" >Kenyon</placeName>, that the remark is a gibe, in which there would be no point unless Philip were already dead. But the use of the perfect tense (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπείληφας</foreign>) seems to imply that he was still living when Hyperides spoke, or had only just been killed.</note> yet you sentenced to death a city as old as ours, never realizing the simple fact that no tyrant has yet risen from the dead, while many cities, though utterly destroyed, have come again to power. You and your party took no account of the history of the Thirty or of the city’s triumph over her assailants from without and those within her walls who joined in the attack upon her.<note resp="editor">The reference is to the return of the democrats to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in <date>403</date> B.C., under Thrasybulus, who had to contend both with the Spartans under Lysander and with the Thirty.</note> It was well known that you were all watching the city’s fortunes, waiting for the chance to say or do something against the people. </p>

You have no right to pity. When others felt compassion for the city’s misfortunes, you and your like were exulting over her.<note resp="editor">At the time of <placeName key="tgn,7010731" >Chaeronea</placeName> (<date>338</date> B.C.).</note> They had resolved to save <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in a spirit which ill deserved the fate they met.

                <p>Why should you spare this man, gentlemen? Because he is a democrat? Why, you are well aware that he has chosen to be the slave of tyrants and is ready on the other hand to give the people orders. Would it be because he is a good man? No; for you twice condemned him as a criminal. True, you may say, but he is useful. Granted; but if you use a man whom you are known to have condemned as wicked, it will appear either that your judgements are wrong or that you welcome wicked men. It is not therefore right to take upon yourselves this man’s misdeeds. On the contrary: the transgressor must be punished. </p>

                <p>And if anyone comes forward with the plea that he has twice before been convicted for illegal proposals and that therefore you should acquit him,<note resp="editor">The penalties for illegal proposals and for giving false witness seem to have been the same, although the exact rules governing them in the 4th century B.C. are not quite clear. In the 5th century a man three times convicted of false witness was automatically disfranchised (See <bibl n="Andoc. 1.74">Andoc. 1.74</bibl>), and the present passage suggests that in the 4th century too a third conviction led to partial <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</foreign>. (Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 51.12">Dem. 51.12</bibl> and <bibl n="Plat. Laws 937">Plat. Laws. 937 c</bibl>, evidently inspired by current Athenian practice.) The actual penalty seems to have been a fine; but if this was not paid the prosecutor had the right to enforce the judgement by a suit of ejection(<foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη ἐξούλης</foreign>) and thus partially disfranchise the culprit. (See <bibl n="Isoc. 16.47">Isoc. 16. 47</bibl>.) When orators speak as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</foreign> were inevitable after any conviction they are probably exaggerating.</note> please do just the opposite, and that for two reasons. In the first place it is a piece of good fortune, when a man is known to have proposed illegal measures, that you should catch him coming up for trial a third time. He is not a good man and need not be spared as such. Indeed you should rid yourselves of him as quickly as you can, since he has twice already proved his character to you. </p>

                <p>And secondly, compare the case of false witness. If people have been twice convicted of this, you have allowed them to refrain from giving evidence a third time, even of events at which they have themselves been present, so that, if anyone is disfranchised, responsibility shall rest, not on the people, but on the man himself, for continuing to bear false witness. Similarly men convicted of illegal proposals need not bring forward proposals in future. If they do they are clearly actuated by some private motive. So that people of this type deserve punishment, not pity. </p>

                <p>I do not wish to speak too long after setting myself as a limit an amphora of water in the clock; so the clerk will read you the indictment again. And now bear in mind the accusations and the laws which you heard read and bring in a verdict that will be just and also expedient for yourselves.</p>
