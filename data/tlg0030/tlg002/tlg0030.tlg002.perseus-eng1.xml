                            <bibl n="Isaeus 6.22">Isaeus 6. 22</bibl>). He had quite a reputation
                        for wit and some of his sayings are preserved. As a descendant of one of the
                        tyrant-slayers, probably of Aristogiton, who appears to have been a member
                        of the tribe <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName>, he
                        enjoyed free meals in the Prytaneum, a privilege to which apparently only

                    abusing you in the market place by day and then coming at evening to dine at

                <p>first because you needed no one but yourself to show you that the city is
                    grateful to her benefactors, you who now enjoy the honors for services which
                    other men once rendered; and secondly because the people drew up a law
                    forbidding anyone to speak ill of Harmodius and Aristogeiton or sing disparaging
                    songs about them.<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">Harmodius and Aristogiton are

                        privilege is not elsewhere recorded.</note> It is therefore scandalous that,
                    though the people saw fit to prevent even a drunken man from abusing your
                    ancestors, you should be speaking ill of the state even when you are sober. </p>

                    jury, and after summing up my argument will leave the platform. The case in
                    which you are going to vote is an indictment for the proposing of illegal
                    measures and the decree under consideration is one congratulating
                        presidents.<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">In the 4th century B.C. the
                        chairman of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pruta/neis</foreign> appointed
                        these presidents by lot, one from each tribe except that to which he himself
                        belonged, for each meeting of the Council or Assembly. After their
                        appointment he drew lots among them for their chairman (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pista/ths</foreign>). (See <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.104">Aeschin. 1. 104</bibl>, <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.39">Aeschin. 3. 39</bibl>,
                        and <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 44.2">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 44.
                        2</bibl>.)</note> Presidents should observe the law during their period of
                    office. These men have broken it. As evidence for both these facts you heard the
                    actual laws read. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="section">
                <p>The sequel now rests with you. For you will make it plain whether you are going
                    to punish the proposers of illegal measures or whether you intend to grant those
                    honors, which till now have been paid to your benefactors, to presidents whose
                    conduct is not lawful; and that too when you have sworn to observe the laws in
                    giving your vote. There is, however, one argument open to them, namely that the
                    people were compelled to pass the votes of honor.<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">i. e., the votes of honor for certain Macedonians. Hyperides
                        agrees that it may have been impossible to avoid passing the votes of honor,
                        but that there was no need to congratulate the presidents for having done
                        so.</note> Even this cannot possibly mislead you; for it cannot be said that
                    we were under any compulsion to crown the presidents. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="section">
                <p>Moreover the defendant has himself made your decision easy, since he stated in
                    writing his reasons for crowning them. They had, he said, been just towards the
                    Athenian people and observed the laws during their office. That is a statement
                    for which you must now summon him to answer. And you, Philippides, show us that
                    what you assumed about the presidents in your decree is true and you will be
                    acquitted. </p>

                <p>But if you think that your usual vulgarity and joking will secure your pardon in
                    court or win from these men any indulgence or sympathy to which you are not
                    entitled, you are a fool and very far from the mark. You see, you laid up
                    popularity for yourself, not in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but elsewhere. You thought fit to cringe before those
                    whom the people feared rather than before the men who now have power to save
                    you. </p>

                <p>You have concluded that one person will be immortal,<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">This passage is important for determining the date of the

                        no point unless Philip were already dead. But the use of the perfect tense
                            (<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pei/lhfas</foreign>) seems to imply that he
                        was still living when Hyperides spoke, or had only just been killed.</note>
                    yet you sentenced to death a city as old as ours, never realizing the simple
                    fact that no tyrant has yet risen from the dead, while many cities, though
                    utterly destroyed, have come again to power. You and your party took no account
                    of the history of the Thirty or of the city's triumph over her assailants from
                    without and those within her walls who joined in the attack upon her.<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">The reference is to the return of the democrats

                        times convicted of false witness was automatically disfranchised (See <bibl n="Andoc. 1.74">Andoc. 1.74</bibl>), and the present passage suggests
                        that in the 4th century too a third conviction led to partial <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)timi/a</foreign>. (Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 51.12">Dem.

                        evidently inspired by current Athenian practice.) The actual penalty seems
                        to have been a fine; but if this was not paid the prosecutor had the right
                        to enforce the judgement by a suit of ejection(<foreign xml:lang="greek">di/kh e)cou/lhs</foreign>) and thus partially disfranchise the culprit.
                        (See <bibl n="Isoc. 16.47">Isoc. 16. 47</bibl>.) When orators speak as if
                            <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)timi/a</foreign> were inevitable after any
                        conviction they are probably exaggerating.</note> please do just the
                    opposite, and that for two reasons. In the first place it is a piece of good
                    fortune, when a man is known to have proposed illegal measures, that you should
                    catch him coming up for trial a third time. He is not a good man and need not be
                    spared as such. Indeed you should rid yourselves of him as quickly as you can,
                    since he has twice already proved his character to you. </p>

                <p>And secondly, compare the case of false witness. If people have been twice
                    convicted of this, you have allowed them to refrain from giving evidence a third
                    time, even of events at which they have themselves been present, so that, if
                    anyone is disfranchised, responsibility shall rest, not on the people, but on
                    the man himself, for continuing to bear false witness. Similarly men convicted
                    of illegal proposals need not bring forward proposals in future. If they do they
                    are clearly actuated by some private motive. So that people of this type deserve
                    punishment, not pity. </p>

                    water in the clock; so the clerk will read you the indictment again. And now
                    bear in mind the accusations and the laws which you heard read and bring in a
                    verdict that will be just and also expedient for yourselves.</p>
