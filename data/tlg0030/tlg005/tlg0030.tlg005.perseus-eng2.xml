                <p rend="align(indent)">Personally, gentlemen of the jury, as I was just saying to those seated beside me, what surprises me is this. Is it really true that Demosthenes, unlike any other man in <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName>, is exempt from the laws which enforce an agreement made by a person against his own interests? Is he unaffected by the people’s decrees, which you have sworn to observe in voting, decrees which were proposed, not by any of his enemies, but by Demosthenes himself, and which the people carried on his motion, almost as though he deliberately sought to destroy himself <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>and yet the just verdict, gentlemen of the jury, is, as I see it, simple: it is in our favor against Demosthenes. In private suits differences are often settled by challenge, and that is how this affair also has been settled. Look at it in this way, gentlemen. The people accused you, Demosthenes, of having accepted twenty talents illegally, against the interests of the state. You denied having done so and drew up a challenge, which you laid before the people in the form of a decree entrusting the matter on which you were accused to the council of the Areopagus. <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . .

Perhaps you will end by asking what you used it for after you obtained it, as though you were demanding a banker’s statement from the Areopagus. I, on the other hand, should like to know from you why the council of the Areopagus said <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/></p>

                <p rend="align(indent)"><gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>the reports. On the contrary they have shown, as you will recognize, an exceptionally democratic spirit in handling the affair. They reported the guilty persons; even this was not done from choice but in answer to repeated pressure from the people; and they did not undertake to punish them on their own responsibility but rightly left it to you, with whom the final authority rests. It is not only his own trial which Demosthenes has in mind when he determines to mislead you by abusing the report; he wishes also to frustrate all the other prosecutions which the city has in hand. That is a point to be carefully borne in mind and you must not be deceived by the defendant’s argument. For these reports concerning the money of Harpalus have all been drawn up by the Areopagus on an equal footing. They are the same for all the accused. In no case has the council added the reason why it publishes a particular name. It stated summarily how much money each man had received, adding that he was liable for that amount. Is Demosthenes to have more weight with you than the report given against him? <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/><note resp="editor">The sense of the missing words appears to be: <q rend="double">If you discredit the report, you thereby admit that no one took the money, and all the others are acquitted.</q></note> For of course this argument, if it protects Demosthenes, will also protect the rest. The sum on which you are pronouncing judgement is not twenty, but four hundred,<note resp="editor">The figure mentioned later, in column 10, is 350 talents, which is confirmed by <bibl n="Plut. Dem. 1.1" >Pseudo-Plut. Dem. 846 B</bibl>. Hence Boeckh suggested the reading 400 in this passage, on the grounds that Hyperides would be more likely to exaggerate than otherwise.</note> talents. You are judging all the crimes, not one. For your mad conduct, Demosthenes, has made you champion of all these criminals, foremost in danger as you are in impudence. In my opinion the fact that you took the gold is proved to the jury well enough by your being condemned by the council to which you entrusted yourself<gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/><note resp="editor" >Although the missing Greek words cannot be restored with certainty, the sense appears to be: <q rend="double">I shall now produce the evidence relating to the gold which you previously accepted, and, as I said, explain why you took the money and for what reasons you disgraced the whole city.</q></note> When Harpalus arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7002681" >Attica</placeName>, gentlemen of the jury, and the envoys from Philoxenus demanding him were, at the same time, brought into the Assembly, Demosthenes came forward and made a long speech in which he argued that it was not right for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to surrender Harpalus to the envoys from Philoxenus,<note resp="editor">Philoxenus, one of Alexander’s generals, was governor of <placeName key="tgn,7002470" >Cilicia</placeName> at the time.</note> and that Alexander must not be left with any cause for complaint, on his account, against the people; the safest course for the city was to guard the money and the person of Harpalus, and to take up all the money, with which Harpalus had entered <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, to the Acropolis on the following day, while Harpalus himself should announce then and there how much money there was. His real purpose, it seems, was not simply to learn the figure, but to find out from how large a sum he was to collect his commission. Sitting below in his usual place in the niche,<note resp="editor">It is not known what niche is meant. It may have been a cutting in the side of the Pnyx. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατατομή</foreign> is cited by Harpocration as occurring in this speech.</note> he told Mnesitheus the dancer to ask Harpalus how much money there would be to take up to the Acropolis. The answer given was seven hundred talents<gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/><note resp="editor">In the missing lines Hyperides probably explained that the Assembly was then dismissed and not summoned again until the following day, when the money had been paid over. <bibl n="Plut. Dem. 1.1">Pseudo-Plut. Dem. 846 B</bibl>, says that Demosthenes was accused of having taken bribes because he had not reported the amount of money brought to the Acropolis or the carelessness of those in charge of it.</note> He had told you himself in the Assembly that that was the correct figure; and yet when the total brought up to the Acropolis was three hundred and fifty talents instead of seven hundred, having by then received his twenty, he did not utter a word<gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>After saying before the Assembly that there were seven hundred talents you now bring up half<gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/><note resp="Loeb">The sense of the mutilated column 11 appears to be: <q rend="double">You did not reflect that if the whole amount originally mentioned was not taken up to the Acropolis someone must have embezzled. You were interested solely in your own fee; for you cannot persuade us that you received nothing when we know that Demades was paid 5000 staters.</q> For the bribe paid to Demades see <bibl n="Din. 1.89">Din. 1.89</bibl>.</note> Harpalus would not have bought <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>nor would the city be exposed to accusation and reproach. But of all these things, Demosthenes <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>It was you who decreed that a guard should be posted over the person of Harpalus. Yet when it relaxed its vigilance you did not try to restore it, and after it was disbanded you did not prosecute those responsible. I suppose you went unpaid for your shrewd handling of the crisis? If Harpalus distributed his gold among the lesser orators, who had nothing to give but noise and shouting, what of you who control our whole policy? Did he pass you over? That is incredible. So supreme is the contempt, gentlemen of the jury, with which Demosthenes has treated the affair, or to be quite frank, you and the laws, that at the outset, it seems, he admitted having taken the money but said that he had used it on your behalf and had borrowed it free of interest<note resp="editor">There does not seem to be an exact parallel for this use of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">προδανείζομαι</foreign> and there are two possible interpretations. (1) The active <foreign xml:lang="grc" >προδανείζω</foreign> apparently has the sense of <q rend="double">lend without interest</q> in Pseudo-Plut. Lives of the Ten Orators 852 B, and in <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 16">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 16</bibl>. If the translation given above is correct, Demosthenes claimed to have borrowed the money from Harpalus and to have advanced it to the Athenian people. (2) On the other hand the noun <foreign xml:lang="grc">προδανειστής</foreign> is used in a Delian inscription with the sense of <q rend="double">one who borrows for another.</q> On this analogy we might translate <foreign xml:lang="grc" >προδανεισμένος</foreign> as <q rend="double">having borrowed for the people.</q> Demosthenes would thus be claiming to have acted as an intermediary in accepting a loan from Harpalus to the state.</note> for the Theoric fund. Cnosion<note resp="editor">Cnosion, a boy with whom Demosthenes was friendly, is mentioned also by <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.149" >Aeschin. 2.149</bibl>, and by the scholiast on that passage.</note> and his other friends went about saying that Demosthenes would be compelled by his accusers to publish facts which he wished kept secret and to admit that he had borrowed the money free of interest for the state to meet expenses of government. Since the anger of those of you who heard this statement was greatly increased by these aspersions cast on your democracy, on the grounds that he was not content to have taken bribes himself but thought fit to infect the people too <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/><note resp="editor">The gist of the missing lines was probably that Demosthenes changed his tactics and began to plead a different excuse.</note> speaking and complaining that the Areopagus was seeking favor with Alexander and for that reason wanted to destroy him. As if you did not all know that no one destroys the kind of man who can be bought. On the contrary, it is the opponent who can be neither persuaded nor corrupted with bribes that men contrive to be rid of by any means in their power. There is some likelihood, it seems, that you, Demosthenes, are deaf to prayers and not to be persuaded into taking bribes? Do not imagine, gentlemen, that only trivial matters are affected by the venal conduct of these men. For it is no secret that all who conspire for power in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> secure the smaller cities by force of arms and the larger ones by buying the influential citizens in them; and we know that Philip reached the height he did because, at the outset, he sent money to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076" >Peloponnese</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, and the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and those with power in the cities and authority<gap reason="lost" rend=" . . .

Naturally enough; for being perpetually unstable himself, I suppose he might well have friends from the Euripus.<note resp="editor">A comparison between the Euripus, a very changeable strait, and the character of Callias is made also by <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.90">Aeschin. 3.90</bibl>.</note> Will you dare then presently to speak to me of friendship <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . .

And yet the positions ought to be reversed: your generation ought to be training the younger orators, reproving and punishing any over-impetuous action. But the fact is just the opposite: the youths are taking to task the men of over sixty.

Because the private individuals were given the money by Harpalus for safe-keeping, but the generals and orators have accepted it with some policy in view. The laws prescribe that ordinary offenders shall pay a simple fine but that men accepting bribes shall pay ten times the usual sum.<note resp="editor">The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδικεῖν</foreign> seems to be used in this context to describe the milder breaches of the law, and is used in the same sense by <bibl n="Aristot.

Dinarchus is misleading when he refers (<bibl n="Din. 1.60" >Din. 1.60</bibl>) to a double fine.

You give full permission, gentlemen of the jury, to the orators and generals to reap substantial rewards. It is not the laws which grant them this privilege but your tolerance and generosity. But on one point you insist: your interests must be furthered, not opposed, with the money they receive. Now Demosthenes and Demades, from actual decrees passed in the city and from proxenies, have each received, I believe, more than sixty talents, quite apart from the Persian funds and money sent from Alexander. If neither of these sources suffices for them, and they have now accepted bribes which threaten the city’s life itself, can we doubt our right to punish them? Suppose that one of you, mere private individuals, during the tenure of some office, makes a mistake through ignorance or inexperience; he will be overwhelmed in court by the eloquence of these men and will either lose his life or be banished from his country. Shall they themselves, after harming the city on such a scale, escape unscathed? <placeName key="tgn,1123029" >Conon</placeName> of Paeania took theoric money for his son who was abroad.<note resp="editor"><placeName key="tgn,1123029" >Conon</placeName> is perhaps the banker to whom Dinarchus refers (<bibl n="Din. 1.43">Din. 1.43</bibl>), and the incident which he mentions later in the speech (i. 56) is possibly the same as that to which Hyperides is alluding here, though according to Dinarchus it was the Areopagus who accused the culprit.
