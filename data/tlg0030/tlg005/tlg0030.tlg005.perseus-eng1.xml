                <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Personally, gentlemen of the jury, as I was just
                    saying to those seated beside me, what surprises me is this. Is it really true
                    that Demosthenes, unlike any other man in <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, is exempt from the laws which enforce an agreement made
                    by a person against his own interests? Is he unaffected by the people's decrees,
                    which you have sworn to observe in voting, decrees which were proposed, not by
                    any of his enemies, but by Demosthenes himself, and which the people carried on
                    his motion, almost as though he deliberately sought to destroy himself . . . and
                    yet the just verdict, gentlemen of the jury, is, as I see it, simple: it is in
                    our favor against Demosthenes. In private suits differences are often settled by
                    challenge, and that is how this affair also has been settled. Look at it in this
                    way, gentlemen. The people accused you, Demosthenes, of having accepted twenty
                    talents illegally, against the interests of the state. You denied having done so
                    and drew up a challenge, which you laid before the people in the form of a
                    decree entrusting the matter on which you were accused to the council of the
                    Areopagus. . . . </p>
            </div>
            <div type="fragment" n="2">
                <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>. . . and you malign the Areopagus and publish
                    challenges, in which you ask how you came by the gold, who gave it you, and
                    where. Perhaps you will end by asking what you used it for after you obtained
                    it, as though you were demanding a banker's statement from the Areopagus. I, on
                    the other hand, should like to know from you why the council of the Areopagus
                    said . . . </p>
            </div>
            <div type="fragment" n="3">
                <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>. . . the reports. On the contrary they have
                    shown, as you will recognize, an exceptionally democratic spirit in handling the
                    affair. They reported the guilty persons; even this was not done from choice but
                    in answer to repeated pressure from the people; and they did not undertake to
                    punish them on their own responsibility but rightly left it to you, with whom
                    the final authority rests. It is not only his own trial which Demosthenes has in
                    mind when he determines to mislead you by abusing the report; he wishes also to
                    frustrate all the other prosecutions which the city has in hand. That is a point
                    to be carefully borne in mind and you must not be deceived by the defendant's
                    argument. For these reports concerning the money of Harpalus have all been drawn
                    up by the Areopagus on an equal footing. They are the same for all the accused.
                    In no case has the council added the reason why it publishes a particular name.
                    It stated summarily how much money each man had received, adding that he was
                    liable for that amount. Is Demosthenes to have more weight with you than the
                    report given against him? . . .<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The sense of
                        the missing words appears to be: “If you discredit the report, you thereby
                        admit that no one took the money, and all the others are acquitted.”</note>
                    For of course this argument, if it protects Demosthenes, will also protect the
                    rest. The sum on which you are pronouncing judgement is not twenty, but four
                        hundred,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The figure mentioned later, in
                        column 10, is 350 talents, which is confirmed by <bibl n="Plut. Dem. 1.1"
                            >Pseudo-Plut. Dem. 846 B</bibl>. Hence Boeckh suggested the reading 400
                        in this passage, on the grounds that Hyperides would be more likely to
                        exaggerate than otherwise.</note> talents. You are judging all the crimes,
                    not one. For your mad conduct, Demosthenes, has made you champion of all these
                    criminals, foremost in danger as you are in impudence. In my opinion the fact
                    that you took the gold is proved to the jury well enough by your being condemned
                    by the council to which you entrusted yourself. . . .<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">Although the missing Greek words cannot be restored with
                        certainty, the sense appears to be: “I shall now produce the evidence
                        relating to the gold which you previously accepted, and, as I said, explain
                        why you took the money and for what reasons you disgraced the whole
                        city.”</note> When Harpalus arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7002681"
                        >Attica</placeName>, gentlemen of the jury, and the envoys from Philoxenus
                    demanding him were, at the same time, brought into the Assembly, Demosthenes
                    came forward and made a long speech in which he argued that it was not right for
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to surrender Harpalus to
                    the envoys from Philoxenus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Philoxenus, one of
                        Alexander's generals, was governor of <placeName key="tgn,7002470"
                            >Cilicia</placeName> at the time.</note> and that Alexander must not be
                    left with any cause for complaint, on his account, against the people; the
                    safest course for the city was to guard the money and the person of Harpalus,
                    and to take up all the money, with which Harpalus had entered <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, to the Acropolis on the following day,
                    while Harpalus himself should announce then and there how much money there was.
                    His real purpose, it seems, was not simply to learn the figure, but to find out
                    from how large a sum he was to collect his commission. Sitting below in his
                    usual place in the niche,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It is not known what
                        niche is meant. It may have been a cutting in the side of the Pnyx. The word
                            <foreign xml:lang="greek">katatomh/</foreign> is cited by Harpocration
                        as occurring in this speech.</note> he told Mnesitheus the dancer to ask
                    Harpalus how much money there would be to take up to the Acropolis. The answer
                    given was seven hundred talents. . . .<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In the
                        missing lines Hyperides probably explained that the Assembly was then
                        dismissed and not summoned again until the following day, when the money had
                        been paid over. <bibl n="Plut. Dem. 1.1">Pseudo-Plut. Dem. 846 B</bibl>,
                        says that Demosthenes was accused of having taken bribes because he had not
                        reported the amount of money brought to the Acropolis or the carelessness of
                        those in charge of it.</note> He had told you himself in the Assembly that
                    that was the correct figure; and yet when the total brought up to the Acropolis
                    was three hundred and fifty talents instead of seven hundred, having by then
                    received his twenty, he did not utter a word. . . . After saying before the
                    Assembly that there were seven hundred talents you now bring up half. . . .<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The sense of the mutilated column 11 appears to
                        be: “You did not reflect that if the whole amount originally mentioned was
                        not taken up to the Acropolis someone must have embezzled. You were
                        interested solely in your own fee; for you cannot persuade us that you
                        received nothing when we know that Demades was paid 5000 staters.” For the
                        bribe paid to Demades see <bibl n="Din. 1.89">Din. 1.89</bibl>.</note>
                    Harpalus would not have bought . . . nor would the city be exposed to accusation
                    and reproach. But of all these things, Demosthenes . . . It was you who decreed
                    that a guard should be posted over the person of Harpalus. Yet when it relaxed
                    its vigilance you did not try to restore it, and after it was disbanded you did
                    not prosecute those responsible. I suppose you went unpaid for your shrewd
                    handling of the crisis? If Harpalus distributed his gold among the lesser
                    orators, who had nothing to give but noise and shouting, what of you who control
                    our whole policy? Did he pass you over? That is incredible. So supreme is the
                    contempt, gentlemen of the jury, with which Demosthenes has treated the affair,
                    or to be quite frank, you and the laws, that at the outset, it seems, he
                    admitted having taken the money but said that he had used it on your behalf and
                    had borrowed it free of interest<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">There does not
                        seem to be an exact parallel for this use of the word <foreign
                            xml:lang="greek">prodanei/zomai</foreign> and there are two possible
                        interpretations. (1) The active <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                            >prodanei/zw</foreign> apparently has the sense of “lend without
                        interest” in Pseudo-Plut. Lives of the Ten Orators 852 B, and in <bibl
                            n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 16">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 16</bibl>. If the
                        translation given above is correct, Demosthenes claimed to have borrowed the
                        money from Harpalus and to have advanced it to the Athenian people. (2) On
                        the other hand the noun <foreign xml:lang="greek">prodaneisth/s</foreign> is
                        used in a Delian inscription with the sense of “one who borrows for
                        another.” On this analogy we might translate <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                            >prodaneisme/nos</foreign> as “having borrowed for the people.”
                        Demosthenes would thus be claiming to have acted as an intermediary in
                        accepting a loan from Harpalus to the state.</note> for the Theoric fund.
                        Cnosion<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cnosion, a boy with whom
                        Demosthenes was friendly, is mentioned also by <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.149"
                            >Aeschin. 2.149</bibl>, and by the scholiast on that passage.</note> and
                    his other friends went about saying that Demosthenes would be compelled by his
                    accusers to publish facts which he wished kept secret and to admit that he had
                    borrowed the money free of interest for the state to meet expenses of
                    government. Since the anger of those of you who heard this statement was greatly
                    increased by these aspersions cast on your democracy, on the grounds that he was
                    not content to have taken bribes himself but thought fit to infect the people
                    too . . .<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The gist of the missing lines was
                        probably that Demosthenes changed his tactics and began to plead a different
                        excuse.</note> speaking and complaining that the Areopagus was seeking favor
                    with Alexander and for that reason wanted to destroy him. As if you did not all
                    know that no one destroys the kind of man who can be bought. On the contrary, it
                    is the opponent who can be neither persuaded nor corrupted with bribes that men
                    contrive to be rid of by any means in their power. There is some likelihood, it
                    seems, that you, Demosthenes, are deaf to prayers and not to be persuaded into
                    taking bribes? Do not imagine, gentlemen, that only trivial matters are affected
                    by the venal conduct of these men. For it is no secret that all who conspire for
                    power in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> secure the smaller
                    cities by force of arms and the larger ones by buying the influential citizens
                    in them; and we know that Philip reached the height he did because, at the
                    outset, he sent money to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076"
                        >Peloponnese</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>,
                    and the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and those with
                    power in the cities and authority. . . .<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The

                    for after gaining a tolerable reputation and great riches, all through you, even

                    take it from the wrong source, and the private individuals who took the gold are
                    not so culpable as the orators and generals. Why is that? Because the private
                    individuals were given the money by Harpalus for safe-keeping, but the generals
                    and orators have accepted it with some policy in view. The laws prescribe that
                    ordinary offenders shall pay a simple fine but that men accepting bribes shall
                    pay ten times the usual sum.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The term <foreign

                        respectively. Dinarchus is misleading when he refers (<bibl n="Din. 1.60"
                            >Din. 1.60</bibl>) to a double fine. A simple fine was doubled only when
                        it was not paid up within a fixed time.</note> Therefore, just as we can
                    lawfully fix the penalty for these men, so also . . . from you against them. . .
                    . It is as I said in the Assembly. You give full permission, gentlemen of the
                    jury, to the orators and generals to reap substantial rewards. It is not the
                    laws which grant them this privilege but your tolerance and generosity. But on
                    one point you insist: your interests must be furthered, not opposed, with the
                    money they receive. Now Demosthenes and Demades, from actual decrees passed in
                    the city and from proxenies, have each received, I believe, more than sixty
                    talents, quite apart from the Persian funds and money sent from Alexander. If
                    neither of these sources suffices for them, and they have now accepted bribes
                    which threaten the city's life itself, can we doubt our right to punish them?
                    Suppose that one of you, mere private individuals, during the tenure of some
                    office, makes a mistake through ignorance or inexperience; he will be
                    overwhelmed in court by the eloquence of these men and will either lose his life
                    or be banished from his country. Shall they themselves, after harming the city
