                <p>Let me explain the kind of method which this man Ariston employs. He issues a
                    summons against everyone he meets, accusing and prosecuting those who do not
                    give him money, but letting go all who are willing to pay. He gives the money to
                    Theomnestus who takes it and buys slaves, providing Ariston with a livelihood,
                    as is done for pirates, and paying him an obol a day for each slave, to enable
                    him to continue permanently as a false informer. </p>

                <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When considering the matter, gentlemen of the
                    jury, we ought to begin with the charges which my accusers themselves brought
                    against me at the outset in the Assembly. My relatives communicated the
                    impeachment to me by letter, and also the charges which they made against me in
                    the Assembly when they brought the impeachment in. Among these was recorded a
                    statement of Lycurgus, who claimed to have been told by the relatives that
                    during the wedding of Charippus to the woman I followed and tried to persuade
                    her to reserve herself and have nothing to do with Charippus. </p>

                <p>Let me now repeat to you the answer which I gave to the relatives and also to my
                    own relations directly I arrived, namely this. If these accusations are true, I
                    agree to having done all the other things set down in the impeachment. But they
                    are false, as is surely obvious to everyone. </p>

                    gentlemen of the jury, with the carriage that conveyed the bride: first a
                    muleteer and a guide, and then her escort of boys, and also Dioxippus.<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">For Dioxippus, the athlete who accompanied

                <p>Was I then so utterly senseless, do you think, that with all those other people
                    in the procession, as well as Dioxippus and Euphraeus his fellow-wrestler, both
                    acknowledged to be the strongest men in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, I had the impudence to pass such comments on a free
                    woman, in the hearing of everyone, and was not afraid of being strangled on the
                    spot? Would anyone have listened to such remarks about his sister as these men
                    accuse me of having made, without killing the speaker? </p>

                <p>And to crown it all, as I said just now, are we to conclude that Charippus was so
                    completely obtuse that he was still prepared to marry her, although in the first
                    place she said beforehand, according to their story, that she was pledged to me
                    and in the second place he heard me encouraging her to keep the promises she had
                    made? Do you think that the mad Orestes, or Margites,<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">Margites, the hero of an old comic epic early attributed to
                        Homer, came to be regarded as the typification of a fool.</note> the

                    the prosecutors in a trial have many advantages over the defendants. For them

                    content, while the men on trial are afraid and so forget to mention a great
                    deal, even of what they have really done. </p>

            <div type="textpart" n="9" subtype="section">
                <p>Also, accusers, speaking first, do not confine themselves to putting the just
                    arguments which support their case, but trump up baseless slanders about the
                    accused and so deprive them of the means of defence. The latter are thus
                    affected in one of two ways. Either they defend themselves against the
                    extraneous charges and fall short in the relevant parts of their defence, or
                    else they forget the accusations which have just been made, and so leave the
                    jury with the impression that these are true. </p>

            <div type="textpart" n="10" subtype="section">
                <p>In addition to this the accusers create a prejudice against the advocates for the
                    defence and distort the case of the accused himself; which is what Ariston here
                    attempted to do, when speaking for the prosecution, since he does not even allow
                    me to benefit from those who come forward to help me intending to share in my
                    defence. What reason is there why they should not? Is it not right that men on
                    trial should be supported by their relatives and friends? Or is there any custom
                    in the city more democratic<note resp="#Loeb" anchored="true">Compare <bibl n="Hyp. 4.11">Hyp. 4.11</bibl>.</note> than that which permits citizens
                    capable of public-speaking to assist those who are incapable when they are in
                    trouble? </p>

            <div type="textpart" n="11" subtype="section">
                <p>But you, Ariston, have not merely discussed my advocates; you even determine my
                    own arguments and tell the jury what they must listen to, what line of defence
                    they must prescribe for me, and what they must not tolerate. Surely it is most
                    unfair that after conducting the prosecution as you wanted you should rob me of
                    my defence, because you know already the honest answers I can offer to your

                    life. No one in the city, whether good or bad, can deceive the community in
                    which you live. Indeed the most reliable testimonial of character which a man
                    can have is his past career, especially in refuting charges like the present.

                    I held the command there for two years, the only cavalry leader who has ever
