<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="1"><head>Vision 1</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">He who brought me up sold me to a certain<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Hermas and Rhoda</note> Rhoda at Rome. After many years I made her acquaintance again, and began to love her as a sister.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">As it stands this is hardly intelligible: presumably the meaning is that Hermas was born a slave, and that his owner sold him to Rhoda. It is implied that he then passed out of her possession, and later on made her acquaintance again. The alternative is that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεγνωρισἀμην</foreign> merely means <q type="translation">came to know her properly.</q></note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>After some time I saw her bathing in the river Tiber, and gave her my hand and helped her out of the river. When I saw her beauty I reflected in my heart and said: “I should be happy if I had a wife of such beauty and character.” This was my only thought, and no other, no, not one.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>After some time, while I was<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Hermas goes to Cumae</note> going to Cumae, and glorifying the creation of God, for its greatness and splendour and might, as I walked along I became sleepy. And a spirit seized me and took me away through a certain pathless district, through which a man could not walk, but the ground was precipitous and broken up by the <pb xml:id="p.9"/> streams of water. So I crossed that river, and came to the level ground and knelt down and began to pray to the Lord and to confess my sins.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Now while I was praying the Heaven was opened, and I<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The Vision of Rhoda speaking from Heaven</note> saw that woman whom I had desired greeting me out of the Heaven and saying: “Hail, Hermas.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And I looked at her, and said to her: “Lady, what are you doing here?” and she answered me: “I was taken up to accuse you of your sins before the Lord.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>I said to her: “Are you now accusing me?” “No,” she said, “but listen to the words which I am going to say to you. ‘God who dwells in Heaven’ and created that which is out of that which is not, and ‘increased and multiplied it’ for the sake of his Holy Church, is angry with you because you sinned against me.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>I answered and said to her: “Did I sin against you? In what place, or when did I speak an evil word to you? Did I not always look on you as a goddess? Did I not always respect you as a sister? Why do you charge me falsely. Lady, with these wicked and impure things?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>She laughed and said to me: “The desire of wickedness came up in your heart. Or do you not think that it is an evil deed for a righteous man if an evil desire come up in his heart? Yes, it is a sin,” said she, “and a great one. For the righteous man has righteous designs. So long then as his designs are righteous his repute stands fast in Heaven, and he finds the Lord ready to assist him in all his doings. But they who have evil designs in their hearts bring upon themselves death and captivity, especially those who obtain this world for <pb xml:id="p.11"/> themselves, and glory in their wealthy and do not lay hold of the good things which are to come.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Their hearts will repent; yet have they no hope, but they have abandoned themselves and their life. But do you pray to God, and ‘He shall heal the sins of yourself’ and of all your house and of all the saints.”</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">After she had spoken these words the Heavens<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The vision of the ancient lady</note> were shut, and I was all shuddering and in grief. And I began to say in myself: “If this sin is recorded against me, how shall I be saved? Or how shall I propitiate God for my completed sins? Or with what words shall I beseech the Lord to be forgiving unto me?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>While I was considering and doubting these things in my heart I saw before me a white chair of great size made of snow-white wool; and there came a woman, old and clothed in shining garments with a book in her hand, and she sat down alone and greeted me: “Hail, Hermas!” And I, in my grief and weeping, said: “Hail, Lady!”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And she said to me: “Why are you gloomy, Hermas? You who are patient and good-tempered, who are always laughing, why are you so downcast in appearance and not merry?” And 1 said to her: “Because of a most excellent lady, who says that I sinned against her.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And she said: “By no means let this thing happen to the servant of God; but for all that the thought did enter your  <pb xml:id="p.13"/> heart concerning her. It is such a design as this which brings sin on the servants of God. For it is an evil and mad purpose against a revered spirit and one already approved, if a man desire an evil deed, and especially if it be Hennas the temperate, who abstains from every evil desire and is full of all simplicity and great innocence.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">“But it is not for this that God is angry with<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Why God is angry</note> you, but in order that you should convert your family, which has sinned against the Lord, and against you, their parents. But you are indulgent, and do not correct your family, but have allowed them to become corrupt. For this reason the Lord is angry with you, but he will heal all the past evils in your family, for because of their sins and wickednesses have you been corrupted by the things of daily life.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But the great mercy of the Lord has had pity on you and on your family, and will make you strong and will establish you in his glory; only do not be slothful, but have courage and strengthen your family. For as the smith, by hammering his work, overcomes the task which he desires, so also the daily righteous word overcomes all wickedness. Do not cease, then, correcting your children, for I know that if they repent with all their heart, they will be inscribed in the books of <pb xml:id="p.15"/> life with the saints.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>After she had ceased these words she said to me: “Would you like to hear me<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The lady reads to Hermas</note> read aloud?” and I said: “I should like it, Lady.” She said to me: “Listen then, and hear the glory of God.” I heard great and wonderful things which I cannot remember; for all the words were frightful, such as a man cannot bear. So I remembered the last words, for they were profitable for us and gentle:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>“Lo, ‘the God of the powers,’ whom I love, by his mighty power, and by his great wisdom ‘created the world,’ and by his glorious counsel surrounded his creation with beauty, and by his mighty word ‘fixed the Heaven and founded the earth upon the waters,’ and by his own wisdom and forethought created his holy Church, which he also blessed—Lo, he changes the heavens, and the mountains and the hills and the seas, and all things are becoming smooth for his chosen ones, to give them the promise which he made with great glory and joy, if they keep the ordinances of God, which they received with great faith.”</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">So, when she had finished reading, and rose<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The close of the vision</note> from the chair, there came four young men, and took up the chair and went away towards the East.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And she called me and touched my breast and said <pb xml:id="p.17"/> to me; “Did my reading please you?” and I said to her: “Lady, this last part pleases me, but the first part was hard and difficult.” And she said to me: “This last part is for the righteous, but the first part was for the heathen and the apostates.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>While she was speaking with me two men appeared, and took her by the arm and they went away towards the East, whither the chair had gone. But she went away cheerfully, and as she went said to me, “Play the man, Hermas.”</p></div></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="2"><head>Vision 2</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">While I was going to Cumae, at about the<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The second vision at Cumae</note> same time as the year before, as I walked along I remembered the vision of the previous year, and the spirit again seized me and took me away to the same place, where I had been the previous year.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>So when I came to the place, I knelt down and began to pray to the Lord and ‘to glorify his name,’ because he had thought me worthy, and had made known to me my former sins.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But after I rose from prayer I saw before me the ancient lady,<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The ancient lady returns</note> whom I had seen the year before, walking and reading out from a little book. And she said to <pb xml:id="p.19"/> me: “Can you take this message to God’s elect ones?” I said to her: “Lady, I cannot remember<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The little book</note> so much; but give me the little book to copy.” “Take it,” she said, “and give it me back.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>I took it and went away to a certain place in the country, and copied it all, letter by letter, for I could not distinguish the syllables.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Hermas no doubt means that it was written, like most early MSS., in a continuous script with no divisions between the words.</note> So when I had finished the letters of the little book it was suddenly taken out of my hand; but I did not see by whom.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">But after fifteen days, when I had fasted and<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The contents of the little book</note> prayed greatly to the Lord, the knowledge of the writing was revealed to me. And these things were written:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Your seed, Hermas, have set God at naught, and have blasphemed the Lord, and have betrayed their parents in great wickedness, and they are called the betrayers of parents, and their betrayal has not profited them, but they have added to their sins wanton deeds and piled up wickedness, and so their crimes have been made complete.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But make these words known to all your children and to your wife, who shall in future be to you as a sister. For she also does not refrain her tongue, with which she sins; but when she has heard these words she will refrain it, and will obtain mercy.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>After you have made known these words to them, which the <pb xml:id="p.21"/> Master commanded me to reveal to you, all the sins which they have formerly committed shall be forgiven them, and they shall be forgiven to all the saints who have sinned up to this day,<note resp="editor" type="footnote">This is the main point of the <q type="title">Shepherd.</q> The primitive teaching was that for sin after baptism no repentance is possible (cf. Heb. vi.). Hermas now states that it has been revealed to him that <q type="mentioned">up to this day,</q> i.e. the time of his revelation, sin will be forgiven to the repentant. But this offer of forgiveness will not be made a second time.</note> if they repent with their whole heart, and put aside double-mindedness from their heart.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For the Master has sworn to his elect by his glory that if there be still sin after this day has been fixed, they shall find no salvation; for repentance for the just has an end; the days of repentance have been fulfilled for all the saints, but for the heathen repentance is open until the last day.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>You shall say, then, to the leaders of the Church, that they reform their ways in righteousness, to receive in full the promises with great glory.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>You, therefore, ‘who work righteousness,’ must remain steadfast and be not double-minded, that your passing may be with the holy angels.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Cf. Herm. <title>Sim.</title> ix,  25 and Martyr. Polycarp, ii 3 with the note on the latter passage as to the doctrine of a transformation of the just into angels after their death.</note> Blessed are you, as many as endure the great persecution which is coming, and as many as shall not deny their life.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>For the Lord has sworn by his Son that those who have denied their Christ have been rejected from their life, that is, those who shall now deny him in the days to come. <pb xml:id="p.23"/> But those who denied him formerly have obtained forgiveness through his great mercy.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">“But, Hermas, no longer bear a grudge against your children, nor neglect your sister, that they may be cleansed from their former sins. For they will be corrected with righteous correction, if you bear no grudge against them. The bearing of grudges works death. But you, Hermas, had great troubles of your own because of the transgressions of your family, because you did not pay attention to them. But you neglected them and became entangled in their evil deeds.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>But you are saved by not ‘having broken away from the living God,’ and by your simplicity and great temperance. These things have saved you, if you remain in them, and they save all whose deeds are such, and who walk in innocence and simplicity. These shall overcome all wickedness and remain steadfast to eternal life.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>‘Blessed’ are all they ‘who do righteousness’; they shall not perish for ever.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>But you shall say to Maximus: ‘Behold, persecution is coming, if it seems good to you deny the faith again,’ ‘The Lord is near those that turn to him,’ as it is written in the Book of Eldad and Modat,<note resp="editor" type="footnote">This book is mentioned among the Apocrypha of the N.T. in the Athanasian Synopsis and in the Stichometry of Nicephorus, but is not extant. It is thought to be quoted in II Clem. xi. 2. Eldad and Modat are mentioned in Numbers xi. 26.</note> who prophesied to the people in the wilderness.” <pb xml:id="p.25"/> </p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">And a revelation was made to me, brethren.<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The revelation as to the ancient lady</note> while I slept, by a very beautiful young man who said to me, “Who do you think that the ancient lady was from whom you received the little book?” I said, “The Sibyl.” “You are wrong,” he said, “she is not.” “Who is she, then?” I said. “The Church,” he said. I said to him, “Why then is she old?” “Because,” he said, “she was created the first of all things. For this reason is she old; and for her sake was the world established.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And afterwards I saw a vision in my house. The ancient<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The ancient lady returns</note> lady came and asked me if I had already given the book to the elders. I said that I had not given it. “You have done well,” she said, “for I have words to add. When, therefore, I have finished all the words they shall be made known by you to all the elect.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>You shall therefore write two little books and send one to Clement and one to Grapte. Clement then shall send it to the cities abroad, for that is his duty; and Grapte shall exhort the widows and orphans; but in this city you shall read it yourself with the elders who are in charge of the church.”</p></div></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="3"><head>Vision 3</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">The third vision which I saw, brethren, was as<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The ancient lady comes again</note> follows:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>I had fasted for a long time, and prayed  <pb xml:id="p.27"/> the Lord to explain to me the revelation which he had promised to show me through that ancient lady; and in the same night the ancient lady appeared to me and said to me: “Since you are so importunate and zealous to know everything, come into the country, where you are farming, and at the fifth hour I will appear to you, and show you what you must see.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I asked her, saying, “Lady, to what part of the field?” “Where you like,” she said. I chose a beautiful secluded spot; but before I spoke to her and mentioned the place she said to me, “I will be there, where you wish.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>I went, therefore, brethren, to the country, and I counted the hours, and I came to the spot where I had arranged for her to come, and I saw a couch of ivory<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The couch of ivory</note> placed there, and on the couch there lay a linen pillow, and over it a covering of fine linen was spread out.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>When I saw these things lying there, and no one in the place I was greatly amazed, and, as it were, trembling seized me and my hair stood on end. And, as it were, panic came to me because I was alone. When therefore I came to myself, and remembered the glory of God and took courage, I knelt down and confessed my sins again to the Lord, as I had also done before.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And she came with<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The six young men</note> six young men, whom I had also seen on the former occasion, and stood by me, and listened to me praying and confessing my sins to the Lord. And <pb xml:id="p.29"/> she touched me and said: “Hermas! stop asking all these questions about your sins, ask also concerning righteousness, that you may take presently some part of it to your family.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>And she raised me up by the hand and took me to the couch and said to the young men: “Go and build.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And after the young men had gone away and we were alone, she said to me: “Sit here.” I said to her: “Lady, let the elders sit first.”<note resp="editor" type="footnote">The meaning is obscure: <q type="mentioned">the elders</q> is often explained as <q type="translation">the Elders of the Church,</q> but it is more probably a mere formula of politeness <q type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">seniores priores.</q></note> She said: “Do what I tell you, and sit down.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Yet when I wished to sit<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Hermas and the couch</note> on the right hand she would not let me, but signed to me with her hand to sit on the left. When therefore I thought about this, and was grieved because she did not let me sit on the right hand, she said to me: “Are you sorry, Hermas? The seat on the<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The place of the martyrs</note> right is for others, who have already been found well-pleasing to God and have suffered for the Name. But you fall far short of sitting with them. But remain in your simplicity as you are doing, and you shall sit with them, and so shall all who do their deeds and bear what they also bore.”</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">“What,” I said, “did they bear?” “Listen,” she said: “Stripes, imprisonments, great afflictions, crucifixions, wild beasts, for the sake of the Name. <pb xml:id="p.31"/> Therefore is it given to them to be on the right hand of the Holiness, and to everyone who shall suffer for the Name; but for the rest there is the left side. But both, whether they sit on the right or the left, have the same gifts, and the same promises, only the former sit on the right and have somewhat of glory.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And you are desirous of sitting on the right hand with them, but your failings are many. But you shall be cleansed from your failings, and all who are not double-minded shall be cleansed from all sins, up to this day.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>When she had said this she wished to go away, but I fell at her feet and besought her by the Lord, to show me the vision which she had promised.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And she again took me by the hand and lifted<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The vision of the town</note> me up, and made me sit on the couch on the left and she herself sat on the right. And she lifted up a certain glittering rod, and she said to me: “Do you see a great thing?” I said to her: “Lady, I see nothing.” She said to me: “Behold, do you not see before you a great tower being built on the water with shining square stones?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Now the tower was being built four-square by the six young men who had come with her; but tens of thousands of other men were bringing stones, some from the deep sea, and some from the land, and were giving them to the six young men, and these kept taking them and building.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>The stones which had been<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The stones</note> dragged from the deep sea, they placed without exception as they were into the building, for they had all been shaped and fitted into the joins with the other stones. And they so fastened one to the other that their joins could not be seen. But the <pb xml:id="p.33"/> building of the tower appeared as if it had been built of a single stone.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Of the other stones, which were being brought from the dry ground, they cast some away, and some they put into the building and others they broke up and cast far from the tower.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And many other stones were lying round the tower, and they did not use them for the building, for some of them were rotten, and others had cracks, and others were too short, and others were white and round and did not fit into the building.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>And I saw other stones being cast far from the tower, and coming on to the road, and not staying on the road, but rolling from the road into the rough ground. And others were falling into the fire, and were being burnt, and others were falling near the water, and could not be rolled into the water, although men wished them to be rolled on and to come into the water.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And she said: “Many indeed shall hear, but some of them shall rejoice when they hear, and some shall mourn. But these also, if they hear and repent, even they shall rejoice. Hear then, the parables of the tower, for I will reveal everything to you.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>The tower which you see being built is myself, the Church, who have appeared to you both now and formerly.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>1 said to her: “Lady, since you have once thought me worthy to reveal everything to me, proceed with the revelation.” And she said to me: “What is permitted to be revealed to you shall be revealed; only let your heart be turned towards God and do not be double-minded as to what you see.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>I asked her: “Why has the tower been built on the water.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I asked her saying: “Lady, I would like to know the end of the stones, and what kind of force<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Here almost the equivalent of <q type="translation">meaning</q>.—<q type="translation">What is their meaning in the vision?</q></note> they have.” She answered me and said: “It is not because you are more worthy than all others that a revelation should be made to you, for there were others before you and better than you, to whom these visions ought to have been revealed. But in order that ‘the name of God might be glorified’ they have been, and shall be, revealed to you because of the double-minded who dispute in their heart whether these things are so or not.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">While I was praying at home and sitting on<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The coming of the shepherd</note> my bed, there entered a man glorious to look on, in the dress of a shepherd, covered with a white goatskin, with a bag on his shoulders and a staff in his hand. And he greeted me, and I greeted him back.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And at once he sat down by me, and said to me, “I have been sent by the most reverend angel to dwell with you the rest of the days of your life.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I thought he was come tempting me, and said to him, “Yes, but who are you? for,” I said, “I know to whom I was handed over.” He said to me, “Do you not recognise me?” “No,” I said. “I,” said he, “am the shepherd to whom you were handed over.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">There is no mention of this in the preceding Visions.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>While he was still speaking, his appearance changed, and I recognised him, that it was he to whom I was handed over; and at once I was confounded, and fear seized me, and I was quite overcome with sorrow that I had answered him so basely and foolishly.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>But he answered me and said, “Be not confounded, but be strong in my commandments which I am going to command you. For I was sent,“ said he, “to show you again all the things which you saw before, for they are the main points which are helpful to you. First of all write my commandments and the parables; but the rest you shall write as I shall show you. This is the reason,” said he, “that I command you to write first the commandments and parables, that you may read <pb xml:id="p.71"/> them out at once, and be able to keep them.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>So I wrote the commandments and parables as he commanded me.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>If then you hear and keep them, and walk in them, and do them with a pure heart, you shall receive from the Lord all that he promised you, but if you hear them and do not repent, but continue to add to your sins, you shall receive the contrary from the Lord. All these things the shepherd commanded me to write thus, for he was the angel of repentance.</p></div></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>When therefore I heard this I wept much, and when he saw me weeping he said, “Why do you weep?” “Because, sir,” said I, “I do not know if I can be saved.” “Why?” said he. “Because, sir,” said I, “I have never yet in my life spoken a true word, but have ever spoken deceitfully with all men, and gave out that my lie was true among all, and no one ever contradicted me but believed my word. How then, sir,” said I, “can I live after having done this?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>“Your thought,” said he, “is good and true; for you ought to have walked in truth as God’s servant, and an evil conscience ought not to dwell with the spirit of truth, nor ought grief to come on a spirit which is holy and true.” “Never, sir,” said I, “have I accurately understood<note resp="editor" type="footnote">The literal meaning of the Greek is <q type="gloss">heard,</q> but the meaning is clearly much more nearly <q type="translation">understood.</q></note> such words.” <pb xml:id="p.77"/></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>“So long as he is ignorant,” said he, “he does not sin, but if the husband knows her sin, and the wife does not repent, but remains in her fornication, and the husband go on living with her, he becomes a partaker of her sin, and shares in her adultery.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>“What then,” said I, “sir, shall the husband do if the wife remain in this disposition?” “Let him put her away,” he said, “and let the husband remain by himself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>“If then,” said I, “sir, after the wife be put away she repent, and wish to return to her own husband, shall she not be received?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>“Yes,” said he; “if the husband do not receive her he sins and covers himself with great sin; but it is necessary to receive the sinner who repents, but not often, for the servants of God have but one repentance. Therefore, for the sake of repentance the husband ought not to marry.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">This mandate is really explaining the practical problem which arose from the conflict between the Christian precept against divorce (Mt. 10,11 f.) and the equally early precept against having intercourse with immoral persons. As the inserted clause <q type="translation">except for the cause of fornication</q> in the Matthaean version of Mk. 10,11f. (Mt. 19, 9; cf. Mt. 5,32 and Lc. 16,18) shows, the latter precept was regarded as more important, and immoral wives were put away, but Hermas and other writers always maintained that this was not strictly divorce, as the innocent party was not free to remarry in order to give the other the opportunity of repenting and of returning.</note> <pb xml:id="p.81"/> This is the course of action for wife and husband.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Not only,“ said he, “is it adultery if a man defile his flesh, but whosoever acts as do the heathen is also guilty of adultery, so that if anyone continue in such practices, and repent not, depart from him and do not live with him, otherwise you are also a sharer in his sin.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>For this reason it was enjoined on you to live by yourselves, whether husband or wife, for in such cases repentance is possible.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>I, therefore,” said he, “am not giving an opportunity to laxity that this business be thus concluded, but in order that he who has sinned sin no more,<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Hermas is guarding against the imputation that he is lowering the standard of morality. This accusation was actually brought against him later by Tertullian.</note> and for his former sin there is one who can give healing, for he it is who has the power over all.”</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">And I asked him again, saying: “If the Lord has thought me worthy for you always to live with me, suffer yet a few words of mine, since I have no understanding and my heart has been hardened by my former deeds; give me understanding, for I am very foolish and have absolutely no understanding.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>He answered me and said, “I am set over repentance, and I give understanding to all those  <pb xml:id="p.83"/> who repent. Or do you not think,“ said he, “that this very repentance is itself understanding? To repent,“ said he, “is great understanding. For the sinner understands that he ‘has done wickedly before the Lord,’ and the deed which he wrought comes into his heart, and he repents and no longer does wickedly, but does good abundantly, and humbles his soul and punishes it because he sinned. You see, therefore, that repentance is great understanding.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>“For this reason then, sir,” said I, “I enquire accurately from you as to all things. First, because I am a sinner, that I may know what I must do to live, because my sins are many and manifold.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>He said to me, “You have heard correctly, for that is so. For he who has received remission of sin ought never to sin again, but to live in purity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For those, then, who were called before these days, did the Lord appoint repentance, for the Lord knows the heart, and knowing all things beforehand he knew the weakness of man and the subtlety of the devil, that he will do some evil to the servants of God, and will do them mischief.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>The Lord, therefore, being merciful, had mercy on his creation, and established this repentance, and to me was the control of this repentance given.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>You see that long suffering is very sweet, surpassing honey, and is valuable to the Lord and he dwells in it. But ill temper is bitter and useless.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">While I was walking in the country I noticed<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Rich and poor like a vine and elm</note> an elm and a vine, and was considering them and their fruits, when the shepherd appeared to me and said: “What are you considering in yourself about the elm and vine?” “I am considering, sir,” said I, “that they are very well suited to one another.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>“These two trees,” said he “are putas a type for the servants of God.” “I should like,” said I, “to know the type of the trees of which you speak.” “You see,” said he, “the vine and the elm.” “Yes, sir,” said I, “I see them.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>“This vine,” said he, “bears fruit, but the elm is a sterile tree. But this vine, if it do not grow upon the elm, cannot bear much fruit, because it is spread on the ground, and the fruit which it bears, it bears rotten, when it is not hanging on the elm. When, therefore, the vine is attached to the elm, it bears fruit from itself and from the elm.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>You see then that the elm gives much fruit, not less than the vine, but rather more.” “How, sir,” said I, “does it bear more?” “Because,” <pb xml:id="p.145"/> said he, “the vine, when it hangs on the elm, gives much beautiful fruit, but when it is lying on the ground, it bears but little fruit and rotten. This parable, therefore, applies to the servants of God, to the poor and the rich.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>“How, sir?” said I, “let me know.” “Listen,” said he. “The rich man has much wealth, but he is poor as touching the Lord, being busied about his riches, and his intercession and confession towards the Lord is very small, and that which he has is weak and small, and has no other power. But when the rich man rests upon the poor, and gives him what he needs, he believes that what he does to the poor man can find a reward with God, because the poor is rich in intercession and confession, and his intercession has great power with God. The rich man, therefore, helps the poor in all things without doubting.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But the poor man, being helped by the rich, makes intercession to God, giving him thanks, for him who gave to him, and the rich man is still zealous for the poor man, that he fail not in his life, for he knows that the intercession of the poor is acceptable and rich toward the Lord.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Therefore the two together complete the work, for the poor works in the intercession in which he is rich, which he received from the Lord: this he pays to the Lord who helps him. <pb xml:id="p.147"/> And the rich man likewise provides the poor, without hesitating, with the wealth which he received from the Lord; and this work is great and acceptable with God; because he has understanding in his wealth; and has wrought for the poor man from the gifts of the Lord; and fulfilled his ministry rightly.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Among men; therefore; the elm appears as if it bore no fruit; and they do not know nor understand that if there is drought the elm which has water nourishes the vine; and the vine, having water continuously; gives double fruit; both for itself and for the elm.

Do you see,” said he, “how many have repented and been saved?” “Yes, Sir,” said I, “I see it.” “See then,” said he, “the mercifulness of the Lord, that it is great and glorious, and he has given his spirit to those who are worthy of repentance.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>“Why then. Sir,” said I, “did not all <pb xml:id="p.205"/> repent?” “He gave repentance to those,“ said he, “whose heart he saw would be pure, and would serve him with all their heart. But in whom he saw guile and wickedness, that they would repent with hypocrisy, to them he gave no repentance, lest they should again defile his name.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I said to him: “Sir, now therefore, explain to me those who gave up the sticks, what is the character of each and their dwelling, that when those hear who have believed and have received the seal, and have broken it, and have not kept it whole, they may recognize their own deeds, and repent, and receive a seal from you and glorify the Lord, that he had mercy on them, and sent you to renew their spirits.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>“Listen,” said he, “those whose sticks are dry and were found moth-eaten are the apostates and the betrayers of the Church, and blasphemers of the Lord in their sins; and moreover they were ashamed of ‘the name of the Lord which was called over them.’ These then have finally perished to God. And you see that not even one of them repented, although they heard the words which you spoke to them, which I commanded you; from such life is departed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And they who gave up their sticks dry and not moth-eaten, these are also near them; for they were hypocrites, and introduced strange doctrines and corrupted the servants of God, and especially those who have sinned, not suffering them to repent, but persuading them with their foolish doctrines.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And you see that many of them have repented since I <pb xml:id="p.207"/> told them my commandments; and they shall still repent.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>When he had said this he said to me: “Let us go, and after two days let us come and cleanse these stones and put them into the building, for everything round the tower must be cleansed lest the Master come suddenly and find it dirty round the tower and he will be angry, and these stones will not go into the building of the tower, and I shall seem to be careless before the Master.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Then he began to look at those which were hard and difficult, and a few of them were rejected, because they could not be hewn, for they proved to be very hard.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And they were glad and took them up, and took away all the stones, and put them whence they had been taken.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>The Son of God is older than all his creation, so that he was the counsellor of his Creation to the Father, therefore the rock is also old.” “But why is the gate new, Sir?” said I.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For if you wish to enter into a city, and that city has been walled round, and has one gate, can you enter into that city except through the gate which it has?” “No, Sir,” said I, “for how is it possible otherwise?” “If then you are not able to enter into the city except through the gate which it has, so,” said he, “a man ‘cannot’ otherwise ‘enter into the kingdom of God,’ except through the name of his Son, who was beloved by him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Do you see,” said he, “the crowd which is building the tower?” “Yes, Sir,“ said I, “I see it.” “They,” said he, “are all glorious angels; by these then the Lord<note resp="editor" type="footnote">It is noteworthy that here the Lord is for the moment identified with the tower.</note> has been walled round.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I thanked the Lord for all these things, that he had mercy on all who call upon his name, and sent the angel of repentance to us who have sinned against him, and renewed our spirit, even when we were already corrupted, and restored our life, when we had no hope of living.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>“Now, Sir,” said I, “explain to me why the tower was not built on the ground but on the rock and on the gate.” “Are you still,” said he, “silly and foolish?” “I need, Sir,” said I, “to ask everything from you, because I am wholly without power of understanding anything.
